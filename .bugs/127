Title: Reschedule icon for passive Check_MK checks
Component: multisite
State: open

Class: feature

When you are in the problems view, there is no direct way
to reschedule a service since the Check_MK service is not
visible. We could add a reschedule icon for passive check_MK
checks as well and let it reschedule the Check_MK service
on that host instead.
