Title: Host named like a Python module will break precompiled checks
Component: core
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.5i1
Class: bug

Operating System: Debian 7

We created a host named 'random' while using Nagios as Core. That leads to
the files random.py and random in var/check_mk/precompiled. The bug: the
other precompiled host checks import 'tempfile' and that in turn imports
'random'. Now somehow the precompiled directory seems to be part of the
import path in that situation and the Check_MK host files is being imported
instead of the real random module.

This only seems to affect that indrectly imported module. A test with creating a
host with the name 'os' did not show any abnormalities.
