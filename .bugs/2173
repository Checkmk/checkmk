Title: WATO backup: Do not save configuration files which are derived from omd configs
Component: wato
State: open
Date: 2015-03-10 11:30:33
Targetversion: 1.2.7
Class: bug

Example:
Currently the file ~/etc/check_mk/multisite.d/mkeventd.mk can be stored in a WATO backup.
This file is automatically created by the OMD hook MKEVENTD.
If the snapshot is extracted on a site with a different configuration setting
there is a discrepancy, leading to errors....

Fix:
- OMD generated files are NEVER put into a WATO snapshot
- When creating a backup, each backup domain stores informations regarding the required
  OMD configuration into a info file
- Upon snapshot restore, each backup domain checks if the requirements of this info file
  are fulfilled. If not, it raises a warning and the snapshot can not get applied.
