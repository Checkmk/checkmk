Title: DropdownChoice: Selects incorrect value if the list of options changes
Component: multisite

Targetversion: future

1) Go to BI Rule editor
2) Create new rule, select Call-a-Rule
3) Modifiy the rules in the background, create new, move rule, etc.
4) Observe that wrong selection is stored

Reason: The DropdownChoice valuespec uses the element number to identifiy
an element If this number changes in the background the selection will be wrong

Problem: since DropdownChoice can be used to edit arbitrary keys - not just
strings, we cannot use other keys then these integers. In order to prevent
users from storing unintended data we could create a checksum over the combined
text that is displayed in the dropdown (i.e. the titles of the choices).
We ship that in an URL variable. If that is present and does not match the
actual choices then we can issue a MKUserError and the user must select
again.
