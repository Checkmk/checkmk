Title: Host tag painters missing after new tags have been created
Component: multisite

If you create a new host tag group in WATO then the according
Multisite painter for that tag is not present. It needs an
Apache reload. Seems that the automatic creation of painters for
the host tag groups is just done once one the module is being
loaded.
