Title: Make notifications mechanics synchronous (improve reliability)
Component: notification
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.7
Class: feature

Currently all notifications are asynchronous without control of success or failure.
We should redesign this API to be either synchronous and establish a back channel
for informing the user about notification failures e.g. using the monitoring log.

Maybe we need to change the mail notifications to use SMTP directly.
