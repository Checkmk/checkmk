Title: Generalize file IO handling and catch various issues in a general way
Component: core
Class: bug
State: done

Targetversion: future

Some general errors like:

- No write permissions
- Disk full
- Disk read-only

e.g.

I hereby send you a report of a crash in the Check_MK Web GUI:

Check_MK Version: 1.2.6p1
Page: wato.py

GET/POST-Variables:
 _action=toggle
 _transid=1442590858/4266942189
 _varname=enable_rulebased_notifications
 folder=
 mode=globalvars

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/index.py", line 250, in handler
    handler()
  File "/usr/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/wato.py", line 235, in page_handler
    result = modefunc("action")
  File "/usr/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/wato.py", line 7451, in mode_globalvars
    save_configuration_settings(current_settings)
  File "/usr/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/wato.py", line 7761, in save_configuration_settings
    save_configuration_vars(per_domain.get(domain, {}), dir + "global.mk")
  File "/usr/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/wato.py", line 7765, in save_configuration_vars
    out.write("# Written by WATO\n# encoding: utf-8\n\n")
IOError: [Errno 28] No space left on device

could be handled in a better way.  We should abstract file IO and handle
these errors in a general way.

But how? If the disk is full various other things will also crash. No state
files can be written. Funny things can happen. Maybe the safest way would
be to immediately shut down the core if there is no space left. Can we actively
watch that and if the free space falls below X MB we stop the core?

This is now handled (at least for the files written by the python code) via the cmk.store
functions which works nice. We are first writing to a temporary file. When this fails,
e.g. because of not enough space, the original file is not affected and the user sees
an error message.
