Title: linux agent: make MK_CONFDIR available to outside tools
Component: checks

Targetversion: 1.2.9
Class: bug

Currently, the user can set the MK_CONFDIR through the agent bakery, but this
will only affect the agent itself and the plugins started by it.  Other tools
that require this path, i.e. the cmk_update-agent when run directly (for
registration) will use the fallback path. We need to provide a way for such
scripts to use the correct MK_CONFDIR value.

One solution could be to change the agent in such a way that it can be
"source"d without executing any of its logic. This way a script can source the
agent to get all the parameters as used by the agent. Alternatively the agent
could accept a parameter "--variables" that make it output such variables and
then quit. Tools would then have to parse that output, but it would be easier
to use in non-bash languages.
