For our reporting scheduler we should support standard time ranges like week, month, quarter and year.
Related to those time rages we should also support last week, last month, last quarter and last year.

Additional we should be able to schedule the creation of those reports on this time ranges.
That will help the customers to create the needed reports for their customers.
