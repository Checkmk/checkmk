BE AWARE: This is an experimental feature!!!

Available commands are:
   update  LANG     ...  Creates or updates a .po file for the given language.
   compile LANG     ...  Compiles the .po file into a .mo file which can
                         be used by gettext.
   edit    LANG     ...  Call update, open .po in editor and compile in one step

  The regular process for translating is:

  1.) Create/update the .po file for the given language
  2.) Edit the .po file
  3.) Compile the .po file to get a .mo file which can be used by gettext

  Locale files are located in: /omd/sites/lancom/local/share/check_mk/locale
