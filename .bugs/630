Title: Reset counter in case of time step
Component: core

Class: bug

If get_counter detects a future timestamp then it
should reset the counter to the current time so
that at least the next time the counter will work.
This happens e.g. in at Windows, because the agent
was sending invalid timestamps in older versions
that are lying in the future and are now repaired.
