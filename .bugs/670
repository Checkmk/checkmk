Title: Notification emails do not handle flapping nicely
Component: core
State: open
Date: 2012-03-30 08:39:31
Targetversion: 1.2.0
Class: nastiness

The notifications that are sent because of flapping
should better display this. Currently it is like this:

Host:     nagios
Alias:    nagios
Address:  127.0.0.1
Service:  Check_MK inventory
State:    OK -> OK
Command:  check-mk-inventory
Output:   OK - no unchecked services found
Perfdata: 

OK -> OK is not good....

Another case: 

Host:     Eiger
Alias:    Eiger
Address:  127.0.0.1
Service:  Build_State_centos60-32
State:    CRITICAL -> CRITICAL
Command:  check_mk-local
Output:   CRITICAL: Build problem. State: error, last update: 2012-03-30 02:27:11.000000000 +0200
Perfdata:
