Title: Checkbox handling in views sometimes broken
Component: multisite
State: open
Date: 2012-05-28 16:13:51
Targetversion: future
Class: bug

The handling of the checkboxes in the views still has
bad control flows. The following will trigger a bug:

1. Open a view where the checkboxes are currently off
2. Turn on the checkboxes
3. Check one of the checkboxes
4. Open the command tab and select a command
5. Do *not* confirm the command but press "No"

Now try to turn *off* the checkboxes. This is not
working!

Furthermore: If you now uncheck the one single
checkbox and again issue a command: it will still
think this box is checked.

----

This is related to the URL parsing code in javascript.
The "no" link destroys the url because it issues a POST
request. We need to make the POST vars available in js
to make this code work again. Maybe we add a general code
which makes all variables available as json construct in JS.

But this does not resolve the problem completely. Once we
have too many vars we need to make POST requests for reloading
views.
