Title: Duplicate Check on Cisco 4500

Generating Nagios configuration...Configuration Error: ERROR: 
Duplicate service description 'Temperature Chassis Temperature Sensor' 
for host 'cat_4500_1'!

- 1st occurrance: checktype = cisco_temp_perf, item = 'Chassis 
Temperature Sensor'

- 2nd occurrance: checktype = cisco_temp_sensor, item = 'Chassis 
Temperature Sensor'

Can we invent something in Check_MK that automatically drops duplicate
services? How can a precedence be implemented? Should we at least issue a
warning? Should this be checked during inventory? The service description
is known at this point of time and a check for duplicates could be done and
the new duplicate checks ignored.

Precedence should be:

1. TCP beats SNMP
2. Alphabetical order

We could do: the cmk -I outputs a warning on duplicate (automatically
ignored) services. WATO introduces a new section: "Duplicate Services"
that simply displays the ignored services.
