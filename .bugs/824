Title: auth.serials are not created in manual installations

Hello,

after update from check_MK 1.2.0p3 to 1.2.1i4 I get in Multisite following error:

Internal error:: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/nagios/etc/auth.serials' (Retry with debug mode)

Here I have to do "touch /usr/local/nagios/etc/auth.serials" to get Multisite working again.

I think the setup.sh script should create this file itself.

I'm testing on CentOS 6.2 64bit.

Best regards
Wolfgang
