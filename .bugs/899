Title: LDAP - removing users.mk and keeping contacts.mk switches all users to htpasswd related
Component: multisite

Targetversion: 1.2.2

The fact that a user belongs to the ldap connector is stored in the
users.mk. When one deletes the users.mk and leaves the roles.mk untouched
all users are converted to "htpasswd" users. This might be ok, since the
removal of files is a inner modification, but we could easily add a
field to the contacts.mk which also marks the users as ldap users.
