Title: Problem with check_mk notify in manually setup check_mk
Component: core
State: open
Date: 2013-03-01 12:42:36
Targetversion: 1.2.3i2
Class: bug

When enable "Debug notifications" from wato (Global settings/Noificatoins)
no notification email are sent, and no debug info is written.
Looks like a file creation/permission problem in directory
/var/lib/check_mk.
If I mkdir /var/lib/check_mk/notify and chmod nagios.nagios
/var/lib/check_mk/notify it works.
Environment: check_mk 1.2.0p3, 1.2.2b1, ubuntu 12.10

2013-09-06 bs: Bug approved
when installing check_mk-1.2.2p1 manually (by setup.sh) the directory
/var/lib/check_mk/notify is not created
and as long as this directory is missing *all* notifications fail
silently!!
directory needs to be created in setup.sh

2013-09-23 bs: should be fixed, added creation of directory to setup.sh
but TEST IS STILL OPEN, needs to wait for 1055 to be fixed
