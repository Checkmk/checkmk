At the moment we have only implemented a simple ldap search. In some directories,
like active directory it leads into a SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED exception when
a query results in more than 1000 response objects.

The solution here is to implement a paged ldap search. An example can be
seen here: http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/tip/18274.html
