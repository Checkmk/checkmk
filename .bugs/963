Title: Package for CentOS 6.4 (64bit): missing dependency
Component: core

Targetversion: 1.2.3
Class: todo


FYI (the least I could do helping your team continue to do a great job with distro integration):

On CentOS 6.4 (64bit), Perl module=Time::HiRes was missing after updating to OMD 1.2.3.i1 from 1.01.20130705.


    Thanks for the tip.  We installed the OMD 1.2.3i1 RPM and then updated our "site" and now monitoring our ESXi hosts!  Unfortunately, all of the PNP graphs stopped updating.  Thoughts?
