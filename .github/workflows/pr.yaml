# This is a simple entry point to execute the basic and most important Python
# tests for Checkmk. We run tools like ruff, black and our pytest based unit
# tests here. Some tests, like integration tests or tests of very specific
# components are not executed.
#
# We focus on the tests that are needed by external developers, e.g. to support
# check plugin development.
