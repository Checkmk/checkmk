#
# This is the configuration file for the pre-commit framework.
# To use this you need to install it seperately and activate it for your repository.
# To do so issue the following commands:
#
#     pip3 install pre-commit
#
# and in your repository
#
#     pre-commit install
#
# That's it. You're done.
