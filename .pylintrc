# Setup the Python paths needed for our tests. This is a bit tricky due to the
# fact that we want to be able to run pylint with and without the --rcfile
# option. Pylint offers pylint.config.PYLINTRC to get the path to the
# automatically found config file, but this doesn't take --rcfile into account.
# So we have to fall back to a slightly hacky method discussed in the post
# https://mail.python.org/pipermail/code-quality/2016-June/000781.html,
# accessing pylint's innards. Not nice, but there is not much we can do about
# this until pylint offers the API requested in the post above. Furthermore,
# note that layout/indentation doesn't work too well in the hook below.
