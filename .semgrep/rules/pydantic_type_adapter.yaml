      message: >-
          Detected the use of TypeAdapter(). Executing TypeAdapter() is a costly operation which can
            lead to a major performance issue if used wrong. Its use may be acceptable when invoked
            only once, e.g. during program startup. Ensure it does not impact performance of your
            program negatively. Add "# nosemgrep: type-adapter-detected" to acknowledge this
            warning.
