Title: check_http: remove uri validator
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b10

Class: fix

From version 1.6.0b1 to 1.6.0b9 WATO validated the URI parameter of the check_http
ruleset. As it turns out, a validator is too restricitve, as it prevents users from
entering variables. It has been removed.
