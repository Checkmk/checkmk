When a rule is opened for editing and an the rule edit dialog detected
an invalid previous value, it prints a warning message about this to
the user.

The same is now done for the rule conditions. In case e.g. a rule refers
to a tag group or tag that does not exist (anymore) in the current WATO
configuration, the dialog shows a warning message instead of silently
dropping the invalid option as it was done before.
