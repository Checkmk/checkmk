Title: Improved validation of incompatible rulespec registration

In case an incompatible rulespec is registered with Checkmk, this
does not affect the whole Host & service parameters configuration
anymore. Instead of this, an error is shown in var/log/web.log and
on the "Extension packages" page of the CEE/CME.
