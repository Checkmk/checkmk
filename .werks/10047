Title: Improved validation of incompatible rulespec registration
Level: 1
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b11
Date: 1568734915
Class: fix

In case an incompatible rulespec is registered with Checkmk, this
does not affect the whole Host & service parameters configuration
anymore. Instead of this, an error is shown in var/log/web.log and
on the "Extension packages" page of the CEE/CME.
