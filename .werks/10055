Title: The Windows Agent service loads correct configuration

Previously, after installation from MSI, the Windows Agent service loaded 
its own configuration too early, thus loading the default(fabric) configuration, 
ignoring bakery configuration.

To use the configuration provided by bakery, you should restart the service 
manually.

Since now Windows Agent loads the configuration only after updating the 
Legacy Agent configuration and after installing the Bakery configuration.
