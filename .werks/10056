Title: Windows Agent command line option 'reload_config' starts/stops plugins

Earlier 'reload_config' did not try to run asynchronous plugins.

Thus, the option was useless for the automatic update of the 
agent with the Agent Updater plugin.

The Windows Agent now starts and stops asynchronous plugins according 
to the configuration just loaded.
