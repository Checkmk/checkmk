Previously the manual use of Windows Installer(check_mk_agent.msi) could lead 
to strange installation errors. This happens during the cleanup of the 
ProgramData folder, because some files in this folder may be locked by 
other running Windows software, Windows Agent's plugins, cmk-update-agent.exe 
or even by the Windows Agent itself.

Since now then the Windows Installer does not touch ProgramData anymore and 
prevents such errors.
