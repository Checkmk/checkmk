Title: FIX upgrade of the Windows Agent 1.5 to version 1.6 includes the spool directory too
Level: 1

Previously the spool directory had been ignored during upgrade from Windows
Agent 1.5 to Windows Agent 1.6. It may lead to failing spool checks.

Now the problem has been fixed: spool directory and all its content are
copied to the working folder of the new Agent
