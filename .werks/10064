Previously, on some versions of Windows, the WMI API call may not clean
data structures correctly. As result the Agent may send extremally high 
values for CPU load, RPC latency and so on.

Now Windows Agent cleans WMI data structures automatically and also cuts all 
received data according to  the length defined by Windows API thus preventing 
such type of error.
