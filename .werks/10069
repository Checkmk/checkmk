With this check you can monitor graylog cluster statistics like number of
inputs, outputs, streams, stream rules, extractors and user. It also outputs
elasticsearch statistics, eg. number of nodes, data nodes, shards, timeouts and
indices. Also mongodb statistics are shown, eg. allocated storage, total,
uncompressed data and average document size and number of extents, collections
and objects. Needs the datasource "Check state of graylog" to be configured.
