The validation process for the input fields of IPv6 addresses will now allow the extension of the zone/interface index and name.
For IPv6 addresses you can add the zone index or interface name/index by appending a % to the IP address followed by the value.
A zone/interface index could be 1, 2, 3 etc. An interface name eth0, wlp5s0, etc.
Example: fe80::aebc:32ff:fe95:8ac1%3 or fe80::aebc:32ff:fe95:8ac1%eth1

For link-local addresses you may need to define the interface when calling tools like ping or tracroute.
Otherwise this error might occour: 'connect: Invalid argument'
