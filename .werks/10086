If a source host is not sending piggyback data for its piggypacked hosts
the services {{Check_MK}} and {{Check_MK Discovery}} of the piggybacked hosts
report
<ul>
<li>CRIT - Got no information of host</li>
<li>OK - X vanished services</li>
<ul>
by default.

Now a validity period and state are configurable within the host rule
{{Piggybacked Host Files}}. This means that the piggybacked data is considered
as {{valid}} within this period. The services {{Check_MK}} and {{Check_MK Discovery}}
treat the piggybacked host data almost as {{live}} such that above warnings are not
shown anymore. Instead the {{Check_MK}} service shows {{still valid}}.
The validity state applies to the {{Check_MK}} service of the piggybacked host within
this period.

This rules has to be configured for the source host.

Moreover the piggybacked data is now cached for 1.5 periods of the check
interval of the Check_MK service of the source host.
