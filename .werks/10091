Title: Agent AWS: Let EC2 services become stale if the instance was terminated

The EC2 piggybacked hostname contains the value of the field 'PrivateIpAddress'.
If an EC2 instance terminates then this field is missing. In this case we skip
this instance and the services of the EC2 instance become stale. Moreover the
Check_MK service reports 'Got not information from host'.
