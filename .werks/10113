Title: heartbeat_crm check: Add "Failed Actions" part to main check, which can now warn if any are present.
Level: 2
Component: checks

By default there is no behaviour change. A new GUI-rule was introduced to allow the user to
switch to the new behaviour. When the user activates "show Failed Actions", any Failed Action
entries will be listed in the status-detail column of the Heartbeat CRM General check and the
check will transition to the WARNING level. If no Failed Action is present, the check will be
in the OK state.
