Title: Make fileinfo work again on old Perl versions

Class: fix

Due to a change in 1.6.0, the fileinfo part of the Checkmk agent only worked
when a Perl >= 5.16 (released in spring 2012) was installed on the client. 
For distributions with ancient Perl versions (Debian Squeeze/Wheezy, Ubuntu
Precise, CentOS 6, SLES 11), fileinfo stopped working.  This has been fixed.
