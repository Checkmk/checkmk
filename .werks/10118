Title: Improved the handling of host checks via service status in CMC.
Level: 1
Component: cmc
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 2.0.0i1

Class: feature

Previously the CMC used an active check (check_lql_service) for this,
querying itself via Livestatus.  This is quite inefficient and convoluted:
The CMC already knows everything it needs internally.

Now the CMC simply propagates every check result of the service in question
directly to the configured host, too.  This is much more efficient, and we
even get all information from the check now, including e.g. the long
output.
