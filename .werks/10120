Under various circumstances, diagnostic output from automation calls (like
warnings etc.) got mangled with the result of the automation call itself.
This could break various things, e.g. activation on changes on local and
remote sites. This has been fixed, the diagnostic output is redirected
to var/log/web.log now.
