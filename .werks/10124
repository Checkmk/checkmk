To ease the Python 2 => Python 3 transition, Livestatus is now very explicit
about string types when using the "python" and "python3" output formats: All
binary strings have a "b" prefix now, and all unicode strings have a "u"
prefix. This makes both formats effectively identical.

If you don't use either format in your scripts or use a Python version >= 2.6,
you don't have to change anything.  If you still use Python <= 2.5 (which
doesn't undestand the "b" prefix), please upgrade.  Note that these Python
versions have an EOL in 2011 or before, so this shouldn't be a problem in
practice.
