There are 2 Livestatus tables consisting only of a single row:
"status" and "eventconsolestatus".  You can't specify a WaitObject
for them (they have no primary key), so you leave this header out
when using WaitCondition/WaitTimeout/...  on these single-row tables.
This special case was broken in early 2.0 versions and has been fixed.
