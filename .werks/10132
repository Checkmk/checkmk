The acknowledgement type of shadow hosts/services was always "none", even
when the corresponding host/service is actually acknowledged.  Now we report
"normal" in these cases, which is more correct.  Note that due to a
limitation in cmcdump, we do not know if the acknowledgement is "sticky" or
not.
