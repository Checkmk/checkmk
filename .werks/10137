Title: jolokia_jvm_memory: New check plugin
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
Version: 2.0.0i1
Date: 1568893404
Class: feature

We introduce the new check plugin {{jolokia_jvm_memory}}. It replaces the old
memory subcheck {{mem}} and the permanent generation subcheck {{perm_gen}}
of the {{jolokia_metrics}} plugin.

In addition it features monitoring of the JVM memory pools in general;
including but not limited to "Code Cache", the legacy "Permanent Generation"
and the newer "Metaspace" pool.

If you are using the plugin {{mk_jolokia}}, you have to redeploy it in order
to get the new services. If you are using the special agent {{agent_jolokia}}
a rediscovery will suffice.

The applicable rulesets are called "JVM memory levels" and "JVM memory pool levels".
Note that rules that you have configured already will not be applied. Please revisit
the WATO page to reconfigure those rules.
Only values configured in percentage will be converted from your legacy rules -
absolute levels for the remaining *free* space are no longer considered,
as the maximum amount of available space may not be known.

Note that the performance data belonging to the "JVM MyInstance Memory" service
will be lost, even though the service name will not change.
