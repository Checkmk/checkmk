In version 1.6.0 the mk_logwatch plugin crashed if a processed logfile could
not be correctly decoded. This lead to log services not being updated. Even
worse a single logfile with this issue could affect other logfiles.

We now replace all characters that can not be encoded with the U+FFFD
replacement character. In addition, in case of an exception we now continue
processing the next file.
