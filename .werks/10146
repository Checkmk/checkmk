The AIX agent plugin {{mk_logwatch.aix}} has been renamed to {{mk_errpt.aix}}.
The plugins name wrongly suggested that it was a version of {{mk_logwatch}}
designed to run on AIX machines.

In fact, mk_errpt.aix (formerly known as mk_logwatch.aix) is a Korn-shell
plugin that will forward all errors reported by the command line tool {{errpt}}
in a way that will create a logwatch service on the monitoring server.

{{mk_logwatch}}, on the other hand, is a python plugin. It should run on any
machine as long as python is installed, in particular it is known to run on
AIX machines.

These two plugins can be deployed independently from one another.
