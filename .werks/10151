If the instance name contained a backslash, the ini-files path was wrongly considered
to contain a subdirectory. When using the agent bakery, this lead to missing
plugins in the deployed agents.

We now replace "\" and "," by "_"; such that the instance "FOO\Bar,5038" will
create the file "mssql_FOO_Bar_5038.ini", instead of "Bar,5038.ini" in the folder
"mssql_FOO".

Users that manually adopted to the previous behaviour, should redeploy the
plugin and move the file accordingly.
