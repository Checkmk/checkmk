Title: Fix excessive memory consumption on systems using apache 2.2 (e.g. RedHat 6)

The site apache was consuming a lot more memory than intended. The memory usage
seemed to grow with every request to the apache 2.2 process. This was caused by
a bad mod_wsgi configuration. This config made each apache process create multiple
python interpreters within a single process, one for each GUI page (views.py, ...).
Apache 2.4 based systems were not affected by this.
