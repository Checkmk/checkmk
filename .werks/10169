When executing the agent through xinetd, the environment is initialized in
a different way than when executing the agent manually from the command line.
This can lead to different locale settings making mk_logwatch use a different
default encoding on linux systems.

Instead of the widely used UTF-8 encoding it assumed ANSI_X3.4-1968 encoding.
With this encoding it was not possible to process UTF-8 encoded log files. The
log file processing was terminated while reading the file, making the GUI show
it as UNKNOWN service.

In the moment we see a ANSI_X3.4-1968 default encoding in mk_logwatch, we
replace this with UTF-8 now.
