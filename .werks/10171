Title: Discovery: Fix triggering of discovery service after changing services

When editing services on the service discovery page it is intended that the
"Check_MK Discovery" service of the current host is retriggered to immediately
reflect the changes that have just been made to the service config.

This trigger was working as expected in previous 1.6.0 releases.
