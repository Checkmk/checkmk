In some cases it happened that some Checkmk version specific cache files,
e.g. in <tt>tmp/check_mk/check_includes</tt> or <tt>var/check_mk/precompiled_checks</tt>
were not updated after the update, making Checkmk use files of the previous
version after the update. The <tt>cmk-update-config</tt> command, which is
automatically executed by <tt>omd update</tt> during the version update, is
now cleaning up these caches automatically to ensure a clean start with the
new version.
