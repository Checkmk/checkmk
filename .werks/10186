Previously the 'wmi_cpuload' section had been executed together with all other
sections and plugins. This could result in realistic looking, but definitely
too high numbers for the CPU load especially when the CPU is weak.

Now the Windows Agent launches the 'wmi_cpuload' section at the very beginning of
the processing cycle, both alone and synchronous, thus providing precise
results for the CPU-load.
