Previously Windows Agent sent IP Addresses for OnlyFrom in the network form.
For example, instead of 127.0.0.1 the Agent reported 127.0.0.1/32
As result, Check MK Site signaled the Warning due to IP Addresses mismatch.

Now this error has been fixed: the Agent reports allowed IP adress(es) 
"as is"
