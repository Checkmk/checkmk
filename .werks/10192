Previous version of the Windows Agent re-installed supplied in MSI file
check_mk.user.yml on every service restart. This behavior denied the editing
of the check_mk.user.yml by end user

Now this error had been fixed: Windows Agent installs check_mk.user.yml into
the check_mk.user.example.yml thus avoiding modifying of user config data.
If the user config file is absent, for example, during fresh installation, then
then check_mk.user.example.yml is copied to the check_mk.user.yml
