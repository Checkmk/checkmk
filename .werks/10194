Previously the Windows Agent may generate too much data during Windows EventLog 
(logwatch) section generation. In fact, size of the data to be send was 
unlimited, the Agent could have created a block of data several gigabytes 
in size.

Now default maximal size of the whole logwatch section of the Windows Agent 
is limited to 500000 bytes. The value of this limit may be changed in 
check_mk.user.yml using variable logwatch.max_size. To have unlimited 
section, the value of the max_size should be set in -1
