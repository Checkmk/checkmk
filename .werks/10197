Previously the Windows Firewall could prevent a connection to the Windows Agent
(this is the default behavior) thus forcing a system administrator to configure
potentially every host with Windows Agent installed.

Now the Windows Agent can configure the Windows Firewall rules that are needed
for the agent.

There are two possibilities:

For Windows Agent service you may edit Checkmk configuration file adding at the end:

C+:
system:
  firewall:
    mode: configure
C-:

Then restart the agent service or trigger a agent configuration reload.

You could also execute the agent exe to set the rules for you. The command
<tt>\path\to\check_mk_agent.exe fw -configure</tt> will configure the firewall
correctly for <tt>\path\to\check_mk_agent.exe</tt>.

It is also possible to make the agent remove the firewall configuration by
setting the mode option to "clear" in the agent configuration file or by
executing the command <tt>\path\to\check_mk_agent.exe fw -clear</tt>.
