Previously the Bakery could not set "use_wmi" option to "no" (false) in the Windows 
Agent's configuration file. This error force the Agent to use only WMI API to 
get information about running processes.

Now the error has been fixed and the Bakery generates the configuration
file for the Windows Agent correctly
