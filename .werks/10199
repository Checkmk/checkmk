Previously the Bakery configured Windows Agent using <tt>check_mk.ini</tt>
configuration file: every script in <tt>enterprise/agents/bakery</tt> directory
could write own configuration data into the own file. All those files had 
been later gathered into one <tt>check_mk.ini</tt> configuration file.

Since this release the Bakery configures Windows Agent using only
<tt>check_mk.bakery.yml</tt>. All data located in the ini file will be ignored.

To correctly configure Windows Agent you must use new parameter in your 
<tt>bake_***</tt> function named <tt>yml_store</tt>. This parameter has type 
YamlStore and imported automatically from <tt>agent_bakery_plugins.py</tt>. 

Now the configuration data of all plugins are stored in a standard Python 
dictionary, which replicates the structure of the Windows Agent's 
configuration file.

The following sample bake function sets the agent port setting for the Yaml 
file. It receives the configured port for the agent configuration and creates 
two entries, "enabled" and "port" in the "global" section.

def bake_agent_port(opsys, conf, conf_dir, plugins_dir, yml_store):
  #                                                     ^^^^^^^^^
  global_section = yml_store.make_section["global"] # mandatory to get dict
  #                                        ^^^^^^
  global_section["enabled"] = True  # mandatory also

  global_section["port"] = conf  # configures the Agent port
  #               ^^^^     ^^^^

The function above creates the following definitions in the 
<tt>check_mk.bakery.yml</tt>:
C+:
global:
  enabled: True
  port: 6551
