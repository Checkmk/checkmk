Title: Rule Text logfiles(Windows) has been moved to Deprecated Rulesets
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0p7
Date: 1574843682
Class: feature


This rule had been fully removed from the Windows Agent since 1.6.0, because
the generic <tt>Text logfiles(Windows, Linux)</tt>  offers better 
functionality. In 1.6.0 the Rule <tt>Text logfiles(Windows, Linux)</tt> is a full 
and effective substitute for the above mentioned deprecated one.

To migrate you have to correctly configure <tt>Text logfiles(Windows, Linux)</tt>.
The old configuration can be fould in the Deprected Rulesets.
