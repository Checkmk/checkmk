Title: check_mk_agent.solaris: Fixed missing MTIME which broke the agent data parsing
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
State: unknown
Version: 1.6.0p1
Date: 1569415336

The MTIME for cached sections was empty such that Checkmk could not
calculate the cache age of these sections.
The fixed Solaris agent has to be deployed or installed on the
affected hosts.
