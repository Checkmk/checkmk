It is now possible to override the builtin active checks by copying them to the
local hierarchy of the monitoring site. Checks created with the
{{WATO > Host & service parameters > Active checks}}
rulesets are now automatically using active checks in the local hierarchy when
they are available.

If you want to use your own path defined via {{$USER*$}} then you have to copy
the check file {{share/check_mk/checks/check_ACTIVE_CHECK_NAME}} to the local
hierarchy, ie. {{local/share/check_mk/checks/check_ACTIVE_CHECK_NAME}} and
adapted the {{command_line}} within this file:
{{"command_line": "$USER*$/check_ACTIVE_CHECK_NAME $ARG1$",}}
