Due to some refactorings the wrong interfaces status of Linux host was used.

This bug was introduced with werk 7370 (1.6.0b1).

The interface service may show {{(UP) CRIT}} instead of {{(UP) OK}}.

Because the status is remember during discovery you have to perform a
re-discovery.

Details:
Let the output of {{ip address}} be {{1: IFNAME: <UP> state UNKNOWN}}. The
state {{UNKNOWN}} was used instead of the {{real}} interface status in the
angle brackets.
