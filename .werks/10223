The {{Checkmk HW/SW Inventory}} service builds up the inventory tree and if
{{Do status data inventory}} is configured in the ruleset {{Do hardware/software inventory}}
the {{Checkmk}} service builds up the status data tree. Latter one also saved
the inventory tree as the {{Checkmk HW/SW Inventory}} service does. This may
result in flapping inventory history entries.

Now the inventory tree is only saved by the {{Checkmk HW/SW Inventory}}
service and the status data tree is only saved by the {{Checkmk}} service if
{{Do status data inventory}} is configured.

Both the commandline {{cmk -vii HOST}} and the {{Checkmk HW/SW Inventory}}
service also run inventory hooks.
