The "Agent" box of the host diagnose page was not returning a result
when contacting some hosts. This was mostly affecting windows hosts,
but could also affect other hosts.

The problem was caused by non ASCII characters in the agent output,
which made the processing fail.

We now first try to decode the agent output with UTF-8, in case this fail we
fallback to the "fallback agent output encoding", which is latin-1. When this
also fails we replace the non decodable characters with some place holder.
