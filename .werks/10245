Title: Fix thread leak triggered by unstable site connections

The livestatus proxy normally keeps open several connections to the remote
livestatus server and uses them in the moment a livestatus query is made
from the central site to the remote site.

In the moment a site is not reachable anymore, for example because of a
network connection issue, this is detected by one of these connections.
The site is then terminating all other connections and trying to recover
from this situation by continuously reconnecting to the remote site.

In this situation the livestatus proxy was not cleaning up it's old connection
threads while opening new ones for the new connections. After some time this
could result in "Resource temporarily unavailable" errors in various places or
"can't start new thread" shown in the GUI.
