When trying to view the parameters of a "Number of threads" service while
having locally configured rules that were saved with Checkmk before version
1.6, an "AttributeError" crash occurred.

The reason is that this ruleset was converted from a single WARN/CRIT parameter
set to a more complex set of parameters. The check and rule editor are correctly
transforming the old values, but this is not possible on the "Parameters of service"
page.

Instead of the crash Checkmk now prints an error message with a hint that you can
open the rule in question for editing and save it again to fix this issue.
