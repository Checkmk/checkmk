In previous 1.6 versions it could happen that 3rd party checks raise
a TypeError exception resulting in a crash report with a message like
this: <tt>TypeError (inventory_sslcertificates() takes exactly 2 arguments</tt>

This issue occurs because we have removed some compatibility code that
dealt with older discovery function syntax. This was planned to be removed
since 1.2.6 and has now been finally done.

Discovery functions of Checkmk checks take a single argument these days.
This is either the agent <tt>info</tt> structure or, in case a check has
a parse function defined, the output of the parse function <tt>parsed</tt>.

Instead of a crash Checkmk produces an error message that should lead you to
the check plugin in question. You will have to either remove or update the
plugin. Normally you simply need to remove the first argument of the discovery
function.
