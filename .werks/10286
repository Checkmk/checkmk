This werk adds the detection and checking of all detected fans, temperature,
voltage and current probes. The services (except the fan probes) will monitor
the pre-determined high and low levels (for warning and critical) given by the
API for each device and {WARN} or {CRIT} if the measured level is too high.
To monitor these new services only a service discovery of the host is needed.

For the fans, discrete checks are created which will {CRIT} if the sensor-state
differs from "normal".

There is no additional configuration.
