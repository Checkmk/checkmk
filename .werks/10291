With the Checkmk REST-API you can execute tasks you would normally perform manually in Checkmk's GUI
on the Checkmk server via custom made scripts.

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer and describes an architecture for the exchange of
data on distributed systems - especially for Web services. The implementation of this REST-API is
done via the HTTP/1.1 protocol, where resources are addressed via URIs and accessed with HTTP
methods (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE).

The API is documented in a machine-readable schema and a human-readable document in English, with
all resources, their input and output parameters and the associated value ranges. The API is
specified in the OpenAPI 3.x specification format.

The documentation for the API can be accessed in Checkmk's GUI under "Navigation > Help > REST-API
Documentation". The specification file can be downloaded by clicking on the "Download OpenAPI
Specification" button at the top of the documentation.

A chapter in the Checkmk Manual specific to the REST-API is currently being created and will be
ready for the 2.0.0 release.
