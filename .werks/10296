 This check behaves simarly to the already existing ntp check. It uses
 the output of {timedatectl timesync-status} as sent by the agent. It
 lists the information of the synchronised time server including the
 server address, stratum, offset and jitter. On a running instance the
 time is synchronised either using ntp or timesyncd. The agent therefore
 determines the correct service and the respective check to use.
