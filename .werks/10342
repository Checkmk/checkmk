If a host has multiple data sources and ALL of these sources have an exception
like empty data, connection problems or timeouts then the inventory tree won't
be overwritten. This may reduce flapping inventory history entries.

If all sources fail the {{HW/SW Inventory}} service reports
{{Cannot update tree (WARN)}}.

Note:
This also concerns hosts with exactly one data source. If this source fails the
inventory tree won't be overwritten, too.
