Re-discoveries on Linux hosts which provide the {{lnx_if}} section may found
new and vanished interfaces if the output of ethtool is missing.

You have to perform a rediscovery on affected Linux hosts.

Details:
lnx_if section consists of three parts: {{ip address}}, {{/proc/net/dev}} and
{{ethtool}}. {{ip address}} and {{ethtool}} may be missing.
If the index of {{/proc/net/dev}} is available we use this one.  Otherwise if
the index of {{ethtool}} is available we use this one.  Otherwise if the index
of {{ip address}} is available we use this one.  As a fallback we calculate the
index synthetically.
