Re-discoveries on Linux hosts which provide the {{lnx_if}} section may found
new and vanished interfaces if the output of ethtool is missing.  You have to
perform a rediscovery on affected Linux hosts.

Moreover if you have already used a previous 1.6.0 version then some interface
statistics may be faulty.

Details:
lnx_if section consists of three parts: {{ip address}}, {{/proc/net/dev}} and
{{ethtool}}. {{ip address}} and {{ethtool}} may be missing.
If the index of {{ethtool}} is available we use this one.
Otherwise we sort the output of {{/proc/net/dev}} as the agent does and
calculate the index synthetically.
