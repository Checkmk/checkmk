If you want to display the field {{last change}} in the interface table you
have to enable {{Do status data inventory}} in the ruleset
{{Do hardware/software inventory}}.

Note:
If {{Do status data inventory}} is enabled then the {{Check_MK}} services
calculate the status data tree every interval; the performance will be reduced
a bit.
