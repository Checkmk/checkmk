The special agent {{agent_aws}} fetches data from an AWS account relying on the
WATO configuration ruleset {{Amazon Web Services (AWS)}} for a given host.

Cloudwatch metrics and other metrics have a resolution of 5 minutes by default.
(S3 has 1 day). In order to save API calls and costs the agent caches the data.

If the special agent configuration changes the agent does not recognize that
and still uses old cached data until the cache expires.

Now the special agent computes a hash over the current configuration and if the
configuration changes the agent fetches live data immediately.

The configuration hash will be stored in
{{tmp/check_mk/agents/agent_aws/HOSTNAME.config_hash}}.

From {{cmk -D HOSTNAME}} you get the commandline of the special agent for a
given host. With the additional option {{--no-cache}} you can update the cached
data, too.

Workaround for previous special agent versions:
Remove the files {{tmp/check_mk/agents/agent_aws/REGION/HOSTNAME/*}}.
