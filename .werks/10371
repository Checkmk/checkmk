When doing a "omd restore" as root user while the version of the site to be restored is not
the OMD default version (mostly the last installed version), the restore could fail. This
issue was discovered on systems which tried to restore a 1.5 site on Checkmk servers
which have a 1.6 default version, but could also occur in other situations.
