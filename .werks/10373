In a distributed environment, where the central site is based on 1.5 and a remote site
has already been migrated to 1.6, the configuration synchronization to the 1.6 site
could remove the local/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/themes directory which lead to the
following error in the GUI: <tt>Internal error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/omd/sites/stable/local/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/themes'</tt>.

The GUI is now able to handle this situation without failing.
