Title: NagVis backends now work with encrypted Livestatus
Level: 1
Component: wato
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

WATO automatically configures backends in NagVis on the central site of a
distributed WATO setup. When the livestatus proxy was not used, the backends
could not be configured to connect to encrypted Livestatus sites.

This is now automatically done. These backends are stored in <tt>etc/nagvis/conf.d/cmk_backends.ini.php</tt>.

In case the Livestatus Proxy Daemon is used, NagVis always uses the local unix
socket connection to the Livestatus proxy. In case it is not used, NagVis will
connect to either the plain text socket or the encrypted Livestatus socket,
just like the Checkmk GUI.

When verifying certificates NagVis uses the trusted certificate authorities
of Checkmk.
