Fixed an unlikely error which could lead to a stopped system apache
process. This could happen when the system apache is reloaded / restarted
while a "omd rm" call is being executed.

This could happen because the site directory is removed while the sites
system apache hook (/omd/apache/[site].conf) still points to the sites
apache config file which does not exist anymore after removing the site
directory.
