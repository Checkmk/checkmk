The previous "docker build" mechanism was using docker build arguments for
handing over the Checkmk enterprise download credentials to the docker image
build procedure. This was making the credentials available in the meta
information of the docker image, which may not be acceptable in many
situations.

If you simply want to use the Checkmk docker container, you don't need to care
about the details below. This is just relevant for the ones building own docker
images with Checkmk using the standard build logic.

This change switches the image build logic to use a small busybox based
container during image building that manages the secret download credentials
and provides it to the "docker build" command. These containers will either be
stopped and removed after the build finished successfully or after 180 seconds.

If you build images on your own, you don't have to change anything if you use
our build logic (docker/Makefile).
