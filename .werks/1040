When you add the check for checking the current event state of a host
in the Event Console than under heavy load it could sometimes happen
that the check would run into an error (<tt>Ressource temporarily unavailable</tt>).
This has been fixed by switching from the Python version of <tt>check_mkevents</tt>
to the C version. This also saves CPU ressources if you have a larger
number of hosts.
