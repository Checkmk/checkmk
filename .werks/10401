The instant reports should have always been controlloled with the
<i>General Permissions -> Instant Reports - PDF Export</i>. Nevertheless
until this werk they were activated under the <i>General Permissions -> Use
reporting</i>. If you used the <i>Use Permissions</i> workaround, please
now change to the correct <i>Instant Reports</i> configuration.
