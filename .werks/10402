Title: Deal with RRD sources which are not updated anymore in multiline graphs

Class: fix

The metrics "Guest operating systems" and "CPU time stolen by other
operating systems" that appear on the CPU utilization service Check for
unix systems are only relevant on virtualized environments. On other cases
they are always zero, and thus completely skipped in the graphs, but still
tracked by the monitoring core.

Checkmk 1.6 stopped delivering this metrics for systems where they are
irrelevant. This saves disk space, and disk I/O improving scalability.

If you update from Checkmk 1.5, the unused RRDs will remain in disk but
won't be updated anymore. If you use the RRD single format you wont
experience any problem, but if you are on RRD format for one RRD per
metric, the RRDs will go out of sync. At the time of drawing the graphs,
this lack of syncronicity will disrupt the resolution of the data, and
crash the graphs, if two metrics have a different resolution.

With this werk, data is resampled after being retrieved from the core if
the metrics on the same graph have different resolutions.
