Customer-Users belong to a customer when working on the CME. They only work
on the GUI of their corresponding remote site. They are allowed to
customize their bookmarks, views, dashboards, reports, etc. These user
local configurations are now retained when receiving files from master as
changes are activated.


Non-customer-users (e.g. GLOBAL users) normally work on the central
site and thus they should be able to use their customizations when they
log into remote sites. Thus all files are synced in their case.

User notifications follow the same logic.
