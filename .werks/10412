Site filter within a customer assigned remote site is quite redundant as
the site only has access to itself, thus never actively used. However, the
filter available targets where poorly listed.

When configuring reports, this site filter aids to establish context for
the report and a poor listing of the single available site(itself) led to
empty results.
