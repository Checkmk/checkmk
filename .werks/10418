Amazon EC2 transitioned from On-Demand instance limits from instance
count-based limits to new vCPU-based limits. Checkmk now imitates that
configuration and allows you to configure vCPU limits per EC2 instance
family, in the same fashion as defined by AWS.

In Checkmk count-based instance limits can still be used per instance type
and total instances.
