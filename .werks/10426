Prevously, an insecure HTTPS setup for the Agent Updater would lead to multiple warnings like

<pre> InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made. Adding certificate verification
is strongly advised. See: https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced-usage.html#ssl-warnings </pre>

This is now replaced with a warning that is evoked only once and that is more informative.
