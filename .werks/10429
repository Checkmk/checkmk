This is a regression since Werk <a href=https://checkmk.com/check_mk-werks.php?werk_id=6711>#6711</a>.

When unpacking as root (as it is normally done), the .tar.gz agent packages from agent bakery
would modify access rights on existing directories like /etc and /usr/lib to have an access level of
0 (no access) on "others" (e.g. 755 changes to 750).

This bug is now fixed with this werk, as the agent bakery temporarily modifies it's umask when
baking the .tar.gz agent packages.
