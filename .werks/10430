Title: Follow rule "match site" at agent updates host selection

Previously, the "match sites" selection within the agent updates
host selection configuration got ignored completely, i.e. updates
were possible for hosts even if the "match site" parameter got selected
and the corresponding monitoring site got not selected.

With this Werk, the parameter is processed correctly.
