It is now possible to choose which, if any, network service should
be shipped and installed with a baked Linux Checkmk agent package.

This can be configured with the new agent ruleset "Checkmk agent network service (Linux)"

It is possible to choose between the following services/super servers setups:
<li>Ship service files for xinetd and systemd, prefer to activate xinetd service,
fallback to systemd if xinetd is not available</li>
<li>Ship and activate xinetd service</li>
<li>Ship and activate systemd service</li>
<li>Don't ship any service files</li>

If no rule is configured, the behavior will be identical to the first of the mentioned
choices (prefer xinetd, fallback to systemd).

If the super server(s) of your choice is/are not available at the target system, you
will be noticed about this on agent installation.

The last option (no service) is a reasonable choice if you want to monitor the hosts
without the use of a super server, e.g. via SSH.
