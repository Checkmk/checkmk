It is now possible to choose which, if any, network service should
be shipped and installed with a baked Linux Checkmk agent package.

This can be configured with the new agent ruleset "Checkmk agent network service (Linux)"

It is possible to choose between the following services/super servers setups:
<ul>
<li>Ship service files for systemd and xinetd, prefer to activate systemd service,
fallback to xinetd if systemd is not available</li>
<li>Ship and activate systemd service</li>
<li>Ship and activate xinetd service</li>
<li>Don't ship any service files</li>
</ul>

If no rule is configured, the behavior will be identical to the first of the mentioned
choices (prefer systemd, fallback to xinetd).

If the super server(s) of your choice is/are not available at the target system, you
will be noticed about this on agent installation.

The last option (no service) is a reasonable choice if you want to monitor the hosts
without the use of a super server, e.g. via SSH.

<b>Note</b>: Please be aware that the default is now the opposite behavior compared to
before. If you leave the mentioned ruleset untouched, existing xinetd services of
baked and installed Checkmk agents will be replaced with it's systemd counterpart.
However, there will be no change in functionality.

<b>Note</b>: With Werk #11400, the systemd socket shipped with the baked Checkmk agent
supports IP Access Lists. If the ruleset "Allowed agent access via IP address" is active,
please be aware that no systemd service/socket will be activated on a host if the
available systemd version doesn't support IP Access Lists (i.e. systemd version < 235).
If the "Checkmk agent network service (Linux)" ruleset is not configured or configured
to "Prefer systemd...", the installation will try to fall back to xinetd with
"only_from"-configuration.

This change will yield no different behavior at the interface to the Checkmk agent.
However, as the implicit change of the service depatcher is at least noticeable,
this Werk is marked as incompatible.
