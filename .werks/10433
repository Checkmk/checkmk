This Werk fixes a regression for Linux and AIX since Werk #6314

When shipped via the agent bakery, the netstat agent plugin executable
is now correctly named "netstat" instead of "netstat.linux" and "netstat.aix"
respectively.

However, the incorrect naming did not interfere with correct plugin execution.
