At the agent updater ruleset, you can specify how to cope with proxy configurations that
exists on the hosts. By default, all proxy configurations should be ignored completely
by cmk-update-agent(.exe). However, the agent updater does an initial HEAD request to
it's configured Checkmk-server, that did not respect the ruleset's configuration.

With is fixed with this Werk.

If you experience problems emerging from the agent updater erroneously following a
configured proxy and because of this failing to connect to Checkmk-server, you can
try to either deactivate your proxy setup and do a manual agent update to a newly baked
agent, or you can replace the host's cmk-update-agent(.exe) executable with the one from
Checkmk-server, located at ~/share/check_mk/agents/plugins/cmk-update-agent, or
~/share/check_mk/agents/windows/plugins/cmk-update-agent.exe respectively.
