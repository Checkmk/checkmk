When calling the agent bakery for the purpose of agent deployment
(normally done automatically via agent updater), occuring errors will be logged
to ~/var/log/web.log. This error log entry is now augmented by the calling
hostname (if it is provided by the calling client). With this information, it
becomes easier to debug host-related errors.
