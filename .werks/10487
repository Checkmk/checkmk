If a host has the tag {{Always use and expect piggback data}} but no piggyback
data is available the {{Check_MK}} service returns a WARNING.

If a host has the tag {{Use piggyback data from other hosts if present}} then
the {{Check_MK}} service does not warn if there's no piggyback data available.
The same applies to the tag {{Never use piggyback data}}.
