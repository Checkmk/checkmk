Previously the maximum cache age, period and {{Check_MK}} service state could be
configured for single piggybacked hosts under {{Exceptions for piggybacked hosts}}.
There you had to state an exact piggybacked host name.

Now a list of piggybacked host names or regular expressions can be configured
in order to ease the configuration for a set of piggybacked host exceptions.

A regular expression must begin with {{~}}.
