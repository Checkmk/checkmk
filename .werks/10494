If the command {{ethtool}} provides information about interfaces the
operational state of an interfaces is UP if ethtool outputs
{{Link detected: yes}} otherwise DOWN in case of {{Link detected: no}}.

If this output is missing then the interface flags in angle brackets of the
command {{ip}} are used to get the operational state. Out interpretation was as
following: If the flags contain UP, the operational status of the interface is
UP.  If the flags contain DOWN, the status is DOWN otherwise it is UNKNOWN.

But we wrongly assumed that these flags contain DOWN. This has been fixed and
now it is handled as following: If the flags contain UP, the status is UP
otherwise it is DOWN.
