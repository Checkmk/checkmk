Due to very different MSSQL environments we cannot state default levels in
general.  One result is that there are a lot of {{MSSQL Connections}} services
which report WARN but which may be OK.

If you count on these default levels for some {{MSSQL Connections}} services
you have to create rules {{MSSQL Connections}} for these services.
