The Checkmk RRD helper is used whenever the microcore tries to create a new rrd file.
During this process the RRD helper tries to parse the autochecks file for the host in question.
In some instances, the autochecks file referred to variables defined within checks.
This caused RRD to silently crash without parsing the content of the autochecks file.
In most instances this had no negative effect.

However, the recently introduced labels might be incorrectly computed because of the missing autochecks file content.
WATO configured RRD rules which rely on labels might be affected by this bug (but only when creating new rrd files).
