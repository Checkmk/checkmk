Earlier versions may have run into memory problems when too much sites were activated at the same time.
Each site was handled in a separate helper process. This consumed quite a lot of memory when your
WATO setup included lots (>50) of sites.


You can now configure how much helper processes are spawned during the activate changes phase.
If there are more sites to activate then available helper processes, the remaining sites are put into a
queue and will be processed once a helper process becomes idle again.


Per default the optimal number of helper processes is calculated automatically (up to 90% remaining RAM is used),
which should be OK for most setups. The new global settings option <tt>Maximum parallel processes during activate changes</tt> allows
you to adjust this value. The hardcoded minium value is 5.
