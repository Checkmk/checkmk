During activate changes each site gets a distinct process to package its snapshot.
If there were more sites than available CPUs on the system, the performance decreased
if dozens of sites packaged a tar file at the same time.

With this change, the number of parallel packaging processes is limited to the number
of available CPUs and the remaining tasks are put into a queue.
