The new dashlet type "Link existing view" has been added. The previous dashlet view
definitions were always holding their own view definition. When an existing view
was added to a dashboard, the whole view definition was copied to the dashlet. Later
edits to the view / dashboard were not affecting the other.

With this change it is now possible to add a view dashlet to a dashboard that simply
reference to a standalone view. When the referenced view is edited, this will change
the view in the dashboard.
