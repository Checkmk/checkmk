The "Log: State type", which was shown in the monitoring events views, was
problematic. Depending on the type of event the painter showed either the state
type (HARD/SOFT) or the actual state (WARNING/CRITICAL/...).

The original painter and the related filter still exist for compatibility, but
we have added a new one named "Log: State information" which presents these
information in a more structured way.
