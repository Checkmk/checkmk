Title: MKP manager: Links to package download URLs are now opened in new window / tab

The download URLs of extension packages could not be opened in previous 1.6 releases,
because the Content Security Policy blocked opening external URLs in the content area
of the GUI. The links are now opened in a new page to prevent this issue.
