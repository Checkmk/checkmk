Checkmk can now ship optional extension packages. This feature has been introduced to
be able to provide feature previews in stable versions. Instead of introducing backported
features for all users, we can now create backports, pack them into optional extension
packages. Each user can then decide to install the package or not.

After installation these packages are treated exactly like manually uploaded
extension packages and can be removed in the same way.

Enterprise Edition users can install the optional extension packages using the dialog
"WATO > Extension packages". Raw Edition users can find optional extension packages
in the path <tt>share/check_mk/optional_packages</tt> once we ship those packages.

At the moment there is no such package shipped with Checkmk. The first optional
extension packages may be added to Checkmk 1.6 in the next weeks.
