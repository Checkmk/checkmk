When working with GUI plugins that are registering custom
global settings by creating a plugin for the default setting
below <tt>local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/config</tt> and
a global setting declaration for WATO below
<tt>local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/wato</tt>, the edit
dialog of the global setting did not work in all cases as
expected.

Some times a <tt>KeyError: '<setting-name>'</tt> exception
was shown in the GUI.
