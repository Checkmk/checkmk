If you quote the service description in local checks, you can use blank
characters now.

As an example, the old format (still supported) and the new
format without and with blank:

F+:mylocalcheck_old_format
echo "0 myservice - OK: This is my custom output"
F-:

F+:mylocalcheck_new_format
echo "0 \"myservice\" - OK: This is my custom output"
F-:

F+:mylocalcheck_new_format_with_blank
echo "0 \"my service\" - OK: This is my custom output"
F-:
