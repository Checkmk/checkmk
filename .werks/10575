Title: mcafee_av_client: Revised detection of McAfee plugin on 64 and 32 bit systems

The old plugin was first executing the 64 bit check. If there is no output it
executes the 32 bit check. If no registry entries are found, it prints an error
message.

The check is now executed matching the architecture of the operating system and
avoids unnecessary error message in plugin output.
