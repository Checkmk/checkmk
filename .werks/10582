Using the WATO rule "Main memory usage (UNIX / Other Devices)", users could specify levels
as absolute values or percent and on used or free memory.

Previously only the 'percent used' combination worked correctly. Now 'percent used' and
'percent free' are supported, while absolute values will result in a warning state,
as this device does not provide absolute values.
