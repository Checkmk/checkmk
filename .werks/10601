We are now converting all plugins in the share/check_mk/checks
and local/share/check_mk/checks to the new format expected by
the future API. Although we are trying to migrate as many check
plugins as possible on the fly, for some plugins this may fail.

These are the anticipated reasons why auto-migration may fail:

<h4>A complex snmp scan function</h4>:

If checkmk fails to auto-migrate a legacy snmp plugin to a section
definition, this is most likely due to an elaborate scan function.
For the auto-migration to work, the scan function must be fairly
simple. Make sure your scan function has the following properties:

<ul>
 <li>it only consists of one single return statement</li>
 <li>it does not in turn call other functions (not even 'all' or 'any')</li>
 <li>it does not negate compound expressions</li>
</ul>

If in doubt, take a look at scan functions that succeed to be migrated
to see what options are available.
