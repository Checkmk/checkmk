We are now converting all plugins to the new format expected by
the future API. Migrated are plugins from

<ul>
  <li>share/check_mk/checks</li>
  <li>local/share/check_mk/checks</li>
  <li>share/check_mk/inventory</li>
  <li>local/share/check_mk/inventory</li>
</ul>

Although we are trying to migrate as many check and inventory plugins
as possible on the fly, for some plugins this may fail.

These are the anticipated reasons why auto-migration may fail:

<h4>A cluster aware SNMP checkplugin</h4>

Checkmk refuses to auto-migrate cluster aware (those with node_info
set to True) SNMP check plugins. Auto converting the data layout
is too error prone.

<h4>A missing SNMP scan function</h4>

Every Checkplugin that specifies an 'snmp_info' key must
specify 'snmp_scan_function' as well.

<h4>A complex SNMP scan function</h4>

If Checkmk fails to auto-migrate a legacy SNMP plugin to a section
definition, this is most likely due to an elaborate scan function.
For the auto-migration to work, the scan function must be fairly
simple. Make sure your scan function has the following properties:

<ul>
 <li>it only consists of one single return statement</li>
 <li>it does not in turn call other functions (not even 'all' or 'any')</li>
 <li>it does not negate compound expressions</li>
</ul>

If in doubt, take a look at scan functions that succeed to be migrated
to see what options are available.
