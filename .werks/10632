Title: livestatus_status: Fix crash on invalid certification age

The livestatus check crashed when there was no value for the expiration date of a certificate.
If the expiration date can not be acquired the information of 'Site certificate validity' will not be shown in the status details.

This value is collected via the linux special agent with the command 'date'.
On 32bit systems for expiration dates after the 19th Jan 2038, the 'date'-command will return an error
'invalid date' and thus the agent returns no value. This is due to the limitation of 32bit systems.

The problems occur for example on Raspberry Pi setups that are 32bit.
Checkmk officially only supportes 64bit systems.
