Title: Fixed rare issue with WATO communication in distributed setups (different OS versions)
Level: 1
Component: wato
Class: fix
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.5i5p1

In distributed setups where the python versions differ, especially the remote site is older
than Python 2.5 and the central site is newer than this, it might happen that the communication
between these both sites is not possible anymore since werk #0984 (2014-06-23 / 1.2.5i4).

This commit makes the communication work again with older python versions. This has been tested
with Python 2.4. It might also work with python 2.3 - but is untested yet.
