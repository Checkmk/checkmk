Previously if ethtool is missing then we do not get any information about
interface speed. Now we collect speed information from
{{/sys/class/net/INTERFACE/speed}} in this case.

You have to install the newest {{check_mk_agent}}.

The speed is remembered during discovery and if the speed changes the interface
service report WARN. Thus you have to rediscover the related services in order
to get the correct speed information.
