A real host may have several data sources like SNMP, agent or other programs.
If all data sources of these hosts fail related the {{HW/SW Inventory}}
services report {{WARN - Cannot update tree}} and the inventory tree will not
be overwritten.  Otherwise the inventory archive would be polluted.

This must not hold for Checkmk clusters which simply inventorize its nodes.
This has been fixed.
