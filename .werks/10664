The piggyback folders {{tmp/check_mk/piggyback}} and
{{tmp/check_mk/piggyback_sources}} may be missing. In this case the cleanup
meachnism {{cmk --cleanup-piggyback}} throughs an exception and aborts. Now if
above directories do not exist the cleanup mechanism terminates immediately
wihtout any errors.
