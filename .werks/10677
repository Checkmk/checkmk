Previously the plugins and local check were always called using <i>Windows 
System account</i>. Such approach could restrict access to some resources, 
for example, network shares. Now this problem has been resolved.

The new ruleset in Bakery <tt>Run plugins and local checks using non-system 
account</tt> gives the possibility to run any Windows script using a given 
user account. 

There are two modes of the rule: 

<i>group mode</i>, in this case Windows Agent provides its own internal 
user in the requested group to run a script.

<i>user mode</i>, in this case the credentials for the given user account 
must be fully specified. 

The <i>group mode</i> is more secure, because no credentials need to be 
stored anywhere, except in the agent internally. When using the 
<i>user mode</i>, the provided credentials are stored on all Checkmk 
servers to which the configuration is applied. Also, the credentials will 
be baked into the distributed to target systems agent bakery 
packages(MSI files).

The same functionality in Raw Edition can be achieved using Agent configuration 
file. 

To set <i>group mode</i>  for desired plugin pattern you should assign 
the name of the local group to the key <tt>group</tt>. To set <i>user mode</i> 
for desired plugin pattern you should assign string with user name and password 
separated with one space to the key <tt>user</tt>. Detailed example you may found 
in the provided configuration file.

We highly recommend using the <i>group mode</i> whenever possible.
