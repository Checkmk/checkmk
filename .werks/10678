Previously, if Windows Agent couldn't find files matching to an entry with a 
glob pattern of <tt>fileinfo</tt> section, then the Agent wrote nothing and 
Check MK monitoring site may wrongly decide, that the service doesn't exist.

Now <tt>fileinfo</tt> generates such entries always. If no files match to  
a glob pattern in config, then the Agent creates a line with keyword 
<tt>missing</tt>.
