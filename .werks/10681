Previously the service of the Checkmk Windows agent have been installed 
using default Windows settings for the Windows service.

The new ruleset in Bakery <tt>Checkmk Windows agent service settings</tt> 
gives the possibility to configure some parameters of the service during 
installation. 

At the time the Bakery can change next parameters: 'Restart on crash', 
'Action on error' and 'Service start type'.

The same functionality in Raw Edition can be achieved using the Agent 
configuration file.
