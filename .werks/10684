The file <tt>cmk-update-agent.exe</tt> is build using pyinstaller, which might
cause a false positive from antivirus software.

Now, to prevent such false positives, this file is obfuscated during creation 
and Windows agent MSI installation file shouldn't cause false positives anymore.

The Windows Agent will automatically remove obfuscation from the file after own 
installation and/or update.

Also, Checkmk software installer removes obfuscation locally from the file to 
provide valid Windows executable file for downloading from WATO web page.
