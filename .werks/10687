Previously in some rare cases, a plugin running in background could interfere Agent 
install routine blocking plugin copy. As a result such plugin, usually
<tt>cmk-update-agent.exe</tt>, might disappear after installation.

Now the problem has been addressed. If the Windows Agent cannot create a well-known 
plugin, it will try to stop the Windows process usiing the name of the plugin.  

Well-known plugins are cmk-update-agent.exe, mk_logwatch.exe and mk_jolokia.exe
