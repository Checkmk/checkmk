With this release Checkmk monitoring software has got a possibility 
to install and to use Python-3 together with the Windows Agent.

It is now possible to develop agent plugins on Windows using Python.
It is now also possible to build real cross-platform plugins (like e.g. 
mk_logwatch)

The Checkmk Python can be installed either automatically(the default), 
if any of deployed plugins need it, or manually, if a user of the Checkmk 
software needs Python-3 functionality on the host.

At the moment the Checkmk Python has version 3.8.1 and will be deployed 
in the directory <tt>%ProgramData%\checkmk\agent\modules\python-3.8</tt>.
The Python will be updated in the future versions together with the agent.
We also ship a collection of useful Python modules, at the moment pyyaml 
and colorama.

Also it is possible to install arbitrary Python modules using Checkmk 
Python's pip.

By default the Checkmk Python will be used as interpreter for all 
plugins with extension .py. It is possible to change this behaviour 
with WATO and .py scripts will be interpreted using Windows system 
Python.

All plugins with extension .checkmk.py will be interpreted with Checkmk 
Python if Checkmk Python is installed.

Important: Checkmk Python doesn't interfere with Windows Operation 
System (registry, installer, paths, etc) and may be removed at any 
moment. It means two important consequences:
1. The Windows Control Panel doesn't have a dedicated entry for Python. 
It is installed as a component of the Checkmk Windows Agent.
2. Checkmk Python isn't added to the Windows PATH environment variable.
