In previous versions it was needed to escape backslashes with another backslash.
This has been cleaned up now. You could leave your configuration untouched and
it still works as before.

In a rare case, if your configuration contains double escaped backslashes, i.e
"\\\\" or even "\\\\\\", this change  will result in one old service being removed
and one new services being discovered. For example, the service "LOG C:\\\\Back\\test.log"
previously discovered as "LOG C:\\Back\test.log" will be discovered now as
"LOG C:\Back\test.log". In this case you will have to rediscover the related Log
services on your hosts.

We recommend finding and replacing the escaped backslashes (if any) with plain
backslash "\" for better usability. You do not need to rediscover services again.

In case you have configured "Logwatch to Event Console forwarding", you may have to
update your forwarding and Event Console rules to match the new log path.
