Two issues on the object parameter page have been fixed:

The links to the rules that are used to create "Classical active and passive
Monitoring checks" services on the WATO "Parameters of service" page could
be wrong in case there were disabled rules on top of the rule list.

The effective settings of rulesets could be displayed with a wrong value.
