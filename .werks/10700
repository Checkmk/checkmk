Title: "Tags using this auxiliary tag" was not listing the referencing tag IDs
Level: 1
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0p8

Class: fix

On the WATO tag configuration page, the auxiliary tags have a column to display
all tags that are referencing this auxiliary tag. Instead of showing the list
of tags, it showed only the ID of the current auxiliary tag. This issue affected
all 1.6 releases.
