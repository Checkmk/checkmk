A new subpage has been added to the tag management of WATO. This page can
be used to analyze the usage of the different tags, for example to prepare
cleanups or redesigns of tag schemes.

This page can be used to get an idea of how the tags are used in hosts, folders
and rulesets.

The usage analyzation is currently not complete, it takes the same object types
into account as the tag deletion / rename validation that is executed when
making changes to tags.

There are a lot of different objects that are using tags, which are currently
not checked by WATO, for example: Rule based notifications, BI aggregations,
status view filters and some more.
