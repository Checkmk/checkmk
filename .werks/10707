Improve the usability of dashboard and report creation. The first step when
creating such a new object is to select whether or not it should show the
information of a single object, for example a single host. The dialog has
now been changed like this:

<ul>
<li>The possible choices are displayed in a dual list choice element</li>
<li>The choices are now primarily sorted by the common use</li>
</ul>
