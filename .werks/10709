The sites SSL certificate (etc/ssl/sites/[site].pem), which is used by
encrypted livestatus communication, was replaced with a fresh certificate
during each "omd update".

When using certificates issued by the site CA, this was not an issue, because
the trust at the central site was established with the site CA. It was only an
issue when trying to replace the site certificate with a certificate signed
by an external CA.
