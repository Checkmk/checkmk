When the agent is queried via systemd, the socket unit creates an instance
of the agent service unit template. These are named something like
<tt>check-mk-agent@842-127.0.0.1:6556-127.0.0.1:33196.service</tt>.

When one of these services failed in the past for some reason, the unit was
left in a failed state and reported by the Checkmk systemd service monitoring
as a failed service.

In reality such errors can occur sporadically for various reasons. However,
they are usually uninteresting. For this reason, the agent is now executed in
such a way that erroneous executions do not lead to a faulty unit.
