The Checkmk Raw Edition was using PNP4Nagios for rendering time series graphs
since it's birth. This software did a good job for years, but is way of a being
a state of the art system.

To improve the user experience of all our Raw Edition users, we decided to make
the basic parts of the Checkmk Enterprise graphing system available to all our
users.

The parts of the graphing system that are included with the Raw Edition ship
the same features as the previous system did. More advanced features, like the
combined, forecast and custom graphs are still only usable by our Enterprise
and Managed Services Edition users.
