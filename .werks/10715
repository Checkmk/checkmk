Title: LDAP: Fix broken sync when a group contains itself

Class: fix

The LDAP synchronization was terminating with an exception when it is
configured to synchronize nested loops and one of the groups to be synchronized
contains itself as member. Loops spanning over multiple layers of groups were
already prevented, but not self referencing objects.
