Introducing separate oracle uptime service as a subcheck of the oracle_instance check.

The uptime information and metric is no longer part of the oracle_instance check.

You have to rediscover services to monitor the new 'ORA <ORACLE_SID> Uptime' services.

The <i>Minimum required uptime</i> parameter that was part of WATO rule <i>Oracle instance</i> does no longer exist.

Uptime levels can now be configured with the new WATO rule <i>Uptime since last reboot of devices with modules</i>.
