If a check output contains pipe characters they are replaced by
"Light vertical bars" (U+2758) before a check result is submitted
to the monitoring core. This characters were not replaced by pipe
characters again before a notification was send. This may result
in cryptic output in systems that cannot display the light
vertical bar.

Now the "Light vertical bar" character is converted back to a
pipe character before notifications are send.
