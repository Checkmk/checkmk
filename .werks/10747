Title: ibm_svc_mdisk: don't crash on discovery
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Version: 1.6.0p10

Class: fix

On devices that do not support the lsmdisk command the check plugin
ibm_svc_mdisk failed so that the "Check_MK Discovery" service showed
the error "UNKN - check failed - please submit a crash report!".
This is fixed.
