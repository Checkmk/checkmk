With this special agent and checks, it's possible to query given projects and
there workflows. This will result in one service per project and workflow that
outputs the number of issues. Furthermore, you can define custom Jira Query
Language (JQL) searches with different options on the result. Therefore, you
have to define a service description for the resulting check and what result
you expect (the count of found issues or the summed up or average values of a
given numeric field). It's also possible to limit the number of processed
results.
