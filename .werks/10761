With this check you can monitor Redis instances. The check gets input from
the redis-cli command "info" and the resulting "Clients" section. It outputs
the number of client connections (excluding connections from replicas), the
longest output list among current client connections, the biggest input buffer
among current client connections and the number of clients pending on a
blocking call (BLPOP, BRPOP, BRPOPLPUSH).

Needs the agent plugin "mk_redis" to be installed.
