To avoid the need for extenal dependencies for the Forecasting Graphs
Checkmk now ships its own implementation of the prediction algorithm.

This Werk replaces Werk #7451. The script {bin/install_fbprophet} available
in Checkmk 1.6 can be used to unistall the external dependencies before
updating to Checkmk 1.7. Once updated to Checkmk 1.7 which also uses
Python3 as default, no script can be provided to clean up python2 runtime
dependecies. As such the user is advised to manually remove the unused
contents of his local folders in {local/lib/python}
