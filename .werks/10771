Title: Fix Service rediscovery for ucd_cpu_util
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: fix

With werk 6952, ucd_cpu_util default configuration changed. However, your
checkmk configuration might still rely on our old default values. Service
rediscovery would crash as old defaults could not be found anymore.

This werk includes the previous default for backwards compatibility,
allowing you to correctly update the service configuration in a service
rediscovery whenever you decide to trigger it.
