Dynamic columns in views, like the "Metric History" or "Metric Forecast"
Painter could only be sorted after the view was displayed. Now directly in
view editor you can setup a sorter for your desired column.

To be able to select such a sorter, you need to configure the column first
and save the view once. After reopening the view editor, you can select the
sorter that is related to the just created column.

Views that have been created with previous versions will result in an error
"Internal error:uuid", because the column identifier has not yet been
generated. To make these views work again, you need to open the view once
in the view editor and save it again.
