The Cisco CPU checks discovery ordering from Werk 7458 is revisited.

There are four Cisco CPU checks: cisco_cpu, cisco_cpu_multiitem, cisco_nexus_cpu, cisco_oldcpu. We discover the Cisco CPU utilization services in the following order:

- if it's a Nexus device the cisco_nexus_cpu check is used

- if the device contains the SNMP table .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.2.* then cisco_cpu_multiitem is used

- if the device either the OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.8.1 or
  .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.5.1 then cisco_cpu. This acts now as a
  fallback and is not strict about verifying device not belonging to cisco
  nexus family. This as a relaxed condition to werk 5748.

- if .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.1.57.0 exists then cisco_oldcpu is used

There may be Cisco hosts which have discovered the 'wrong' check type. After a re-discovery the CPU check type may change.
