Previously if inventory trees of hosts could not be loaded (eg. caused by
corrupt data) various views which use the inventory data were broken and only
displayed the error 'Cannot read PATH/TO/INV_DATA ...'.
Now an error message is shown at the top of the page and the page content is
displayed as usual.
