Title: lnx_if: Fix grouping of interfaces on clusters

On clusters a check plugin processes all node data at once. Interfaces may be
grouped by index. The check plugin {{lnx_if}} serially numbered the interface
indices across all node data. This led to missing interfaces in a group. Now
the check plugin serially numbers the interface indices PER node.
