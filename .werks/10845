In some cases the credentials have been wrong for remote instances, if they
should use the default login data. Instead the last login entry for selected
databases has been used. Now the bakery uses the correct login data if the
remote instance has not been defined in the selected databases.

To make this fix work, you will have to rebuild your agents in the Agent
Bakery.
