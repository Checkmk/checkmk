An configuration directory for mk_oracle has been added.  mk_oracle
usually reads mk_oracle.cfg. Now it also reads all files with *.cfg from
$MK_CONFDIR/mk_oracle.d This feauture is needed for setups with bakery and
local changes on the database server. It is possible to configure through
the bakery and add custom SQLs in configuration directory.

All variables in files from mk_oracle.d will oerwrite possible entries from
mk_oracle.cfg.
