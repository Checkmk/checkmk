A configuration directory for <code>mk_oracle</code> has been added. <code>mk_oracle</code>
usually reads <code>mk_oracle.cfg</code>. Now, it also reads all files with <code>*.cfg</code> from
<code>$MK_CONFDIR/mk_oracle.d</code>. This feauture is needed for setups with bakery and
local changes on the database server. It is possible to configure through
the bakery and add custom SQLs in configuration directory <code>mk_oracle.d</code>.

All variables defined in files from the <code>mk_oracle.d</code> directory will overwrite entries with the same name from
<code>mk_oracle.cfg</code>. Further, all variables defined in <code>*.cfg</code> files within the <code>mk_oracle.d</code>, must be unique, otherwise the last
read file wins.
