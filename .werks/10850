Class: fix

Instances that are fetched remotely ignored the exclusion of sections
due to wrong variable in the code. This is now fixed, so that the Variable
EXCLUDE_{SID} now works also for remote instances. This bug has been introduced
with 1.6.0.

Please replace the patched mk_oracle plugin and perform a rediscovery. In
case the unwanted section has been an async. please delete the cache or wait
for the rediscvoery until the cache time has expired.
