With this release we publish the first feature pack of Checkmk. The idea behind
the feature packs is that we can make selected features of the next stable
release available to users of the current stable release much earlier. This
allows features to be used and improved earlier.

These features are delivered as optional features. They are included in our software
as MKP packages which can be installed manually.

This feature pack contains these features:

<ul>
    <li>Azure AD: Monitor Users and Sync Interval</li>
    <li>Graylog Special Agent</li>
    <li>Check plugins for Huawei switches</li>
    <li>Jenkins special agent and checks</li>
    <li>Jira Special Agent and checks</li>
    <li>Kubernetes ingress and job info</li>
    <li>MongoDB bugfixes and new checks</li>
    <li>TP-LINK Switches Check Plugins</li>
</ul>

To install these features, you first need to install 1.6.0p9 or newer. Users of the
Enterprise Edition can then open "Configuration > Extension Packages" and select
the package of your choice to be installed. From this point it behaves just like
any other MKP you have installed.

Users of the Raw Edition need to use the command line interface to install these
packages. For example: <tt>mkp install share/check_mk/optional_packages/huawei_switches-1.0.mkp</tt>.

For details on how to use the new checks, please have a look at the manpages of
the checks.
