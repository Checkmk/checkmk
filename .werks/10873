In previous versions of Checkmk the title of reports could only be set to a
fixed size. Especially with generic reports, like host or service reports, this
is a problem because the titles can be of different lengths and can even exceed
the width of the document.

The "One line of text" report element has now a new configuration option
"Shrink too long texts", which is disabled by default. Once you enable this
option, the text size will be estimated before adding it to the document.

In the moment the text is too long, the system tries to wrap the text and
reduce the font size at the same time. In many cases the text is inserted in
such a way that it fits. There are still cases where the text still cannot be
made to fit properly, but for the most common cases this should be a good
enough fit.

We have changed the default "host" report template to use the new setting for
the title of the page. In case your reports are based on your own template
and want to use the new option, you will have to enable the option in the
report elements of your report template.
