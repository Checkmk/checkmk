Updated SNMP check for monitoring the CPU utilization for devices using the UCD-MIB.
For example for Dell EMC ECS (cloud storage system) get now discoverd.
The check monitors a more generalized range of devices which are not vendor specific.

The two values for 'ssCpuRawKernel' and 'ssCpuRawInterrup' do no longer get queried from the SNMP host,
since the data is already included into the 'ssCpuRawSystem' value.
