Fixed the calculation for the CPU utilization. The system value used the outdated values/OIDs.

No longer query the CpuRawKernel value, since its already included in the CpuRawSystem.
CpuRawSystem = CpuRawKernel + CpuRawWait

The system value gets computed as:
system = CpuRawSystem + CpuRawInterrupt + CpuRawSoftIRQ
(CpuRawInterrupt in this case is equal to IRQ)
