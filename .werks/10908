Users experienced crashes of uptime checks with some Fortigate devices. This is because
the data delivered by these devices does not contain any timestamps. As a solution, the
uptime check will not be discovered any more if the delivered data cannot be interpreted
as a timestamp. To apply this fix, users have to re-discover the services of the 
corresponding hosts.
