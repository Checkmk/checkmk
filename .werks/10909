This werk enables Check_MK to send notifications about changes
in the states of hosts and services to Cisco Webex Teams (both
spaces and teams).

First, you need to setup a webhook to your team or space, see
<a href="https://apphub.webex.com/teams/applications/incoming-webhooks-cisco-systems" target="_blank">here</a>,
which will allow Check_MK to post messages. Next, in Check_MK,
under "WATO - Notifications", create a new notification rule.
Select "Cisco Webex Teams" as the notification method. Copy the 
URL of your webhook into the Webhook-URL field. Optionally, if 
you want sent messages to include hyperlinks to Check_MK, enable 
the field "URL prefix for links to Check_MK".
