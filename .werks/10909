This werk enables Checkmk to send notifications about changes
in the states of hosts and services to Cisco Webex Teams (both
spaces and teams).

First, you need to setup a webhook to your team or space, see
<a href="https://apphub.webex.com/messaging/applications/incoming-webhooks-cisco-systems-38054" target="_blank">here</a>,
which will allow Checkmk to post messages. Next, in Checkmk,
under "WATO - Notifications", create a new notification rule.
Select "Cisco Webex Teams" as the notification method. Copy the
URL of your webhook into the Webhook-URL field. Optionally, if
you want sent messages to include hyperlinks to Checkmk, enable
the field "URL prefix for links to Checkmk".
