Checkmk uses a tmpfs internally. This can grow over time. To prevent running out-of-memory on this filesystem, checkmk's tmpfs is automatically added to the monitoring after site creation.

The rule "Discovery parameters for filesystem checks" now supports regex for "Mountpoints to never ignore".

There is <b>no change</b> for already existing Checkmk installation. If the available tmpfs of an already existing installation should be monitored, the following procedure can be followed:

<ul>
 <li>Create a rule "Discovery parameters for filesystem checks"</li>
 <li>Under "Mountpoints to never ignore" add the regex ".*/omd/sites/[^/]+/tmp$"</li>
 <li>Perform a Check_MK Discovery on your Checkmk server</li>
</ul>
