In the previous version, there was one WATO rule which handled both
the summary systemd service and the individual systemd services. This union
led to a confusion as some configuration options had no effect on one of the two
service types. This change now introduces a split between these two services. The
systemd summary service has now its own WATO rule configuration. The user is required
to configure a new WATO rule for the systemd summary service.
