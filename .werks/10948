Title: systemd_units: WATO rules modification to allow compability
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0p11
Date: 1584453928
Class: fix

In the previous version, the splitting of WATO rules for the systemd
individual services and the systemd summary service was performed
without compability for previously configured systemd rules.
This incompability led to the warning display "Unable to read current options
of this rule. Falling back to default values." within the WATO rule page.
This change resolves the warning display by ignoring the incompatible keys.
It allows the user to continue using the previous WATO rules concerning the individual
systemd services only. A new WATO ruleset must be configured for the systemd summary check.
