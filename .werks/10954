For memory checks based on the output of a UCD SNMP deamon (check ucd_mem),
cached and buffered memory are now counted as free memory. This is consistent
with the behaviour of the agent for Linux systems. As a result, the memory
usage displayed by checkmk for hosts with this service might decrease if
buffered and cashed memory are part of the SNMP information given to checkmk.
