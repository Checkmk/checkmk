This werk adds two additional checks for Application Load Balancers. For
each registered target group, one additional service is created. For target
groups of type "instance" or type "ip", this service monitors the number
of HTTP 2XX, 3XX, 4XX and 5XX errors produced by the respective target
group. For target groups of type "lambda", the service monitors the number
of Lambda user errors. There are no default upper levels, but they can
be configured using the WATO rule "AWS/ELBApplication target errors".
