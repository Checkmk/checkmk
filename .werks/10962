This werk fixes a bug which affected the conversion of AWS
Cloudwatch metrics with a statistics of type "Sum" into rates.
Without this fix, the computed rates are too high by a factor
of 10. Affected checks:

- aws_elb.http_elb

- aws_elb.http_backend

- aws_elb.backend_connection_errors

- aws_elbv2_application.http_elb

- aws_elbv2_application_target_groups_http

- aws_elbv2_application_target_groups_lambda

- aws_s3_requests

- aws_s3_requests.http_errors

Note that only the absolute values were affected, no the
computed percentages (if any).
