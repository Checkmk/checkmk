It is now possible to set a cache age for all UNIX agent plugins
via agent bakery rule.

In the new ruleset "Set cache age for plugins (UNIX)", you can define a
set of a glob style pattern and an interval, that gets applied to all
plugin files (files at /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins on the target hosts)
of the matching agent package and that results in caching the plugin's
agent outputs for the given interval. Additionally, you can decide whether
this set should override interval times from the plugin's dedicated ruleset.

This ruleset can be specified and applied multiple times.

Please note that no verification is done whether the configured intervals are
suitable for the matching plugins. Especially, please be careful when overriding
intervals from the plugin's dedicated rules, as there may be a default/minimal
caching time for performance or other reasons.
