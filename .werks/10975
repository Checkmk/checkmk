The agent bakery now recognizes files placed under the local hierachy of
the Checkmk site and packages them as a replacement for the corresponding
non-local/builtin-files.

Previously, this feature was available for some files like "custom-files" or the agent
itself. Now this holds true for all files that get packaged into the baked agent package.

For example, if you want to replace a plugin file, that is located at
<code>~/share/check_mk/agents/plugins/my_plugin</code>, you would place
your own version at <code>~/local/share/check_mk/agents/plugins/my_plugin</code>.

Additionally, the agent bakery watches all files that are relevant for a package
and will invalidate the current package upon changes in file size, modification 
date, or file permissions, resulting in a newly baked package with new agent hash on
bake request.
This is visible by an orange-colored "Bake agents" button at the agent bakery.

Especially, if a file is added to the local hierarchy as a replacement for a builtin-file,
this will be recognized as a file change and result in a new package on bake request.

Please note: Some files will get renamed by the bake process, e.g. the source file
<code>check_mk_agent.linux</code> will result in <code>check_mk_agent</code> in the final
agent package. In order to get a local file packaged, you always have to place your local
file using the source name (Here: <code>~/local/share/check_mk/agents/check_mk_agent.linux</code>).
