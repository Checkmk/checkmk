In the ruleset {{Systemd Single Services Discovery}} you can configure
{{Descriptions}}, {{Service unit names}} or {{States}}. If no {{States}} are
configured but {{Descriptions}} or {{Service unit names}} Checkmk does not
discover any service.  All three parameters are optional.  Checkmk should
discover services if at least one entry matches. This has been fixed.
