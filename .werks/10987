Title: HW/SW Inventory Service: Fix "State when inventory fails"
Level: 1
Component: inv
Class: fix

State: unknown

The state of the HW/SW Inventory service can be determined by
{{State when inventory fails}} in the ruleset {{Do hardware/software Inventory}}.
This state was overwritten by the following error cases:
<ul>
<li>Empty output, default CRIT</li>
<li>Connection, default CRIT</li>
<li>Timeout, default CRIT</li>
<li>Exception, default UNKNOWN</li>
</ul>

This behaviour was introduced with 1.5.0 and and has been fixed now:
The HW/SW Inventory service state won't be overwritten any more.
