In the logwatch.cfg a cluster configuration may be of the form
C+:
CLUSTER cluster-name
 1.2.3.4
 5.6.7.8
C-:

The REMOTE_HOST variable may begin with "::ffff:HERE.COMES.IPv4.ADDRESS".

In order to make this setup work correctly the mk_logwatch state file
must be named as "/PATH/TO/logwatch.state.cluster-name".

This has been fixed.
