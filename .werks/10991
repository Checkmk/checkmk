The Cisco CPU checks discovery ordering from Werk 7458 is revisited.

There are four Cisco CPU checks: cisco_cpu, cisco_cpu_multiitem, cisco_nexus_cpu, cisco_oldcpu.
We discover the Cisco CPU utilization services in the following order:

- if it's a Nexus device ("NX-OS" in SysDescr and OID ".1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.305.1.1.1.0" is set)
  the cisco_nexus_cpu check is used

- if the device is not a Nexus device and contains the SNMP table
  ".1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.2.*" and NOT the deprecated OID
  "1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.5.1" (cpmCPUTotal5min)
  then cisco_cpu_multiitem is used.

- if the device either the OID ".1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.8.1" or ".1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.5.1"
  then cisco_cpu. This acts now as a fallback and is not strict about verifying
  device not belonging to cisco nexus family. This as a relaxed condition to werk 5748.

- if .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.1.57.0 exists then cisco_oldcpu is used

There may be Cisco hosts which have discovered the 'wrong' check type. After a re-discovery the
CPU check type may change.
