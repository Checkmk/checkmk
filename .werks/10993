In order to improve error analysis there's a new WATO mode {{Diagnostics}}.
With this new mode you can collection some general information about the
Checkmk server and version. Details can be found on the {{Diagnostics}} page.

In the future this mode will be extended with specific diagnostics elements,
eg. information about local files.

This mode will help you to analyse error situations. Another purpose is to have
an interface for collecting information for our support, your customers or
simply for your own analysis.

The diagnostics information are stored within tar files in the folder
{{var/check_mk/diagnostics}}. At the moment maximal five of these tar files are
stored. This number is not configurable.

There's also a command line option for collecting diagnostics information and
collects information about the Checkmk site where it's executed.
C+:
cmk --create-diagnostics-dump [OPTIONS]
C-:

Note: The {{Diagnostics}} mode does not solve any problems. It's just a data
collection which consolidates some commands and therefore facilitates error
analysis.
