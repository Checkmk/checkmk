The Windows agent plugin {{mk_inventory.vbs}} reports the install date of every exe
file. We convert this date to an integer in order to filter or sort in HW/SW inventory
views. The date format depends on the client host and can be different.

Example:
{{%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S}} or {{%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S}}.
In this case we cannot distinguish DAY and MONTH in general (eg. "01/02/2020").

This has been fixed. Now the install date of exefiles always has the format
{{%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S}}.
Please install the newest agent plugin {{mk_inventory.vbs}}.
