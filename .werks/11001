Within the ruleset {{Periodic service discovery}} you can indicate service
names or regexes in {{Activate only services matching}} resp.
{{Don't activate services matching}} below
{{Service Filters}} > {{Dedicated white-/blacklists for new and vanished services}}
in order to control which new detected services are added automatically.

Now there are two new lists {{Remove only matching vanished services}} and
{{Don't remove matching vanished services}} for vanished services below
{{Service Filters}} > {{Dedicated white-/blacklists for new and vanished services}}
in order to control which vanished services are removed automatically.

Below {{Service Filters}} > {{Combined white-/blacklists for new and vanished services}}
you can give patterns for both new and vanished services.

Migration notes: Previously there were only the options
{{Activate only services matching}} and {{Don't activate services matching}}
for new {{and}} vanished services. These kind of rules are migrated to be
compatible: these lists can now be found below
{{Service filters}} > {{Combined white-/blacklist for new and vanished services}}.
