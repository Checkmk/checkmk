Within the ruleset {{Hostname translation for piggybacked hosts}} the option
{{Convert FQHN}} drops the domain part, eg. "host123.foobar.de -> host123".  If
a hostname begins with a number then the translation failed because this name
was wrongly detected as an IP address, eg. "123host.foobar.de" -> "123host.foobar.de".
This has been fixed.
