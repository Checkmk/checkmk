Title: esx_vsphere_counters: no longer raise false alarms because of invalid data from ESX Host
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1409212163
Class: fix

Sometimes the ESX Host does not report valid counter ids.<br>
It may look like <br>

```
<id>
  <counterId>-2147483645</counterId>
  <instance>84</instance>
</id>
```

If this happens the `<<<esx_vsphere_counters>>>` section in the agent is empty.
Any checks which relied on this section are now able to handle this scenario by raising a MKCounterWrappedException.
Therefore these checks will no longer go UNKNOWN, but stale...
