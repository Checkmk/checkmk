If a perfometer definition like:

<b>perfometers["check_mk-mem.linux"] = my_perfometer</b>

is set in '~/local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/perfometer" and the
key is already present within the builtin perfometers, the local definition had
no effect.

From now on, such local customizations are taken into account.
