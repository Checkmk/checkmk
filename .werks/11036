Title: Fixed KeyError in site specific global settings if no explicit customer is set

Class: fix

If no explicit customer is used, the site specific global settings page could
crash with "KeyError ('customer')". As a workaround, you can just edit the site
via "Properties" at the "Distributed Monitoring" page and save the settings
again. This will set the missing key.

From now on "provider" is set, if no explicit customer is present in the site
configuration file.
