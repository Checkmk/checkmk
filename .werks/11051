If a notification rule used the option "Exclude Service Groups (regex)" and
no service group was defined for a service the notification rule processing
crashed. In the var/log/notify.log a traceback that contains the line
"TypeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '__getitem__'" was shown.
This is fixed.
