To avoid intentional or unintentional overload due to too many parallel queries
from one source we set the parameter "per_source" in the default Checkmk agent
xinetd configuration and "MaxConnectionsPerSource" to 3.  It limits the number
of concurrent connections per source address. If you need more requests per
source system, you can of course increase or remove this value.

In regular setups where a single Checkmk site or a small number of sites per
Checkmk server monitors one host this should be no problem. Please let us know
in case this limitation is a problem for you.
