Synchronizing configurations between the central and remote sites has taken too
much time in the past because the entire configuration was always synchronized.
Even files that are still present on the remote site were completely
synchronized, which led to increased computing effort, traffic and runtime.

This mechanism has now been replaced by an incremental mechanism. Before each
synchronization, the system determines which files already exist on the remote
site. Only those files are synchronized that differ from the central site.

For the migration from Checkmk 1.6 to 1.7 the change is compatible. Both
central 1.6 sites can communicate with remote 1.7 sites and 1.7 central sites
can communicate with 1.6 remote sites. Mixed environments should only be used
for migration purposes. In such a scenario, the previous synchronization
mechanism is used. After 1.7 this compatibility mode will be removed.
