The Dynamic configuration is now loading plugins that are located below
the path <tt>local/lib/check_mk/cee/dcd/plugins/connectors/</tt>.

You can find a minimal example connector implementation it in your site at
<tt>lib/check_mk/cee/dcd/plugins/connectors/example_connector.py</tt>.  You may
use this as base for your own connectors. To enable this connector, you need to
copy it to the plugin directory mentioned above and uncomment the registry
registration lines in the plugin (See TODO).

To be able to configure connections based on this connector in the GUI, you
also need to deploy a GUI plugin. An example can be found in your site at
<tt>lib/check_mk/gui/cee/plugins/wato/example_dcd_connector.py</tt>.  This
needs to be placed in the WATO plugin directory of your site. You also need to
uncomment the registry registration line in the plugin (See TODO).
