This werk introduces monitoring of AWS Web Application
Firewalls (WAF, V2 only). The monitoring includes overall
limits for AWS WAFV2 (both region-wide and per-Web ACL
limits) and a summary of all Web Access Control Lists
(ACLs). Furthermore, the werk includes monitoring of the
number of requests (total, allowed and blocked) for each
Web ACL. To use this werk, you have to configure the
related AWS special agent to monitor AWS WAFV2. Note that
there is a specific option to also include WAFs in front
of CloudFront resources in the monitoring.
