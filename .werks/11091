Title: AWS monitoring: adjustments to werk #10962 and bugfixes

This werk adjusts the output several checks for AWS
services. With werk #10962, the output of these checks
changed from sums over some time period to actual rates,
which can be interpreted by the user. This werk adjusts
the output units and metrics of these checks accordingly:

- aws_elb

- aws_elbv2_application.connections

- aws_elbv2_application.http_redirects

- aws_elbv2_application.statistics

- aws_elbv2_network.connections

- aws_elbv2_network.rst_packets

- aws_elbv2_network.statistics

- aws_elbv2_network.tls_handshakes

- aws_s3_requests.select_object

- aws_s3_requests.traffic_stats

Furthermore, for the following checks, the agent output has
been adjusted to be in line with what the user expects (e.g.
averages instead of sums for latencies, also partially connected
to werk #10962).

- aws_elbv2_application

- aws_elbv2_network

- aws_s3_requests.latency

Finally, a few bugs, such as integer instead of floating output,
have been fixed. Where necessary, rules and manpages have also been
updated.
