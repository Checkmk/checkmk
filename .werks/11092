With this werk, the monitoring of limits for AWS
services is split into one service per region. Before,
all regions were combined into a single service, which
resulted in potentially quite a lot of output and
caused problems with the graphs for 2 or more regions.

To apply this werk, users have to re-discover the
corresponding services, which will result in a loss
of the historically recorded metrics. This is best done
using "Automatic refresh (tabula rasa)" in the WATO-menus
of the affected hosts. Note that rules for upper or lower
levels created before this werk are not affected and will
apply to all newly discovered services. After installing
the werk, they can be modified to only apply to certain
regions.
