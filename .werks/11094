This werk fixes several issues with the AWS RDS monitoring:

- User-defined instance names crashed the AWS special agent
  if the instance did not exist.

- The restriction of the monitored instances using tags did
  not work.

- Monitoring two or more regions which contained instances
  with the same names resulted in duplicate service names.
  As a result, only the services corresponding to one of the
  monitored regions were displayed. This is fixed by changing
  the corresponding service items to contain both the instance
  name and the region, which makes them unique. For this fix to
  take effect, users have to re-discover the affected services.
  Note that this renaming results in a loss of historically
  recorded metrics. Furthermore, any user-defined rules for
  these services which use service items might have to be
  adjusted.

The following services are affected by the change described
in the last point above: aws_rds_summary.db_status, aws_rds,
aws_rds.cpu_credits, aws_rds.network_io, aws_rds.bin_log_usage,
aws_rds.transaction_logs_usage, aws_rds.replication_slot_usage,
aws_rds.disk_io, aws_rds.connections, aws_rds.agent_jobs, 
aws_rds.replica_lag.
