The check hyperv_vms now uses a set of default levels to map the
state of VMs to monitoring states. Before, by default, the check
compared the current VM state against the state at the point when
the service was discovered and went CRIT if the two states did not
match. This behavior is still available, but the check now has to
be specifically configured to do this, see the rule "State of 
Microsoft Hyper-V Server VMs".

Furthermore, the check now always works when executed as a manual
check. Before, it might have crashed in this case, depending on
the used configuration.

This change is incompatible in the sense that users have to adjust
the rules for this check to make it behave the way it did before.
