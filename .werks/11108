Title: Resolving of plugins default parameters during discovery

This werk only affects users that use an *.mk file in etc/check_mk/conf.d/ to override
the default parameters of a check plugin.

Previously the reference to this variable was saved in the autochecks, such that the value of
corresponding variable was determined just before each execution of the check plugin.

Now the value of the variable is evaluated during discovery, and the resulting value will be
saved in the autochecks and used for every subsequent execution of the check plugin.

Autochecks that have references to variable names in them will be converted during the update
process to Checkmk 1.7 or by running `cmk-update-config -v` manually.

Users that use an etc/check_mk/conf.d/*.mk file to set these default parameters are encouraged
to configure an appropriate WATO rule instead.
