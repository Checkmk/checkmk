Users can now entirely disable individual SNMP sections using the rule
"Disabled and enabled sections (SNMP)".
(During the 2.0.0 beta phase it has briefly been called "Include or
exclude SNMP sections".)

As a result, the related data will not be fetched from the corresponding devices.
This may be useful if you want reduce the traffic on your network, or
suppress device responses that are known to be wrong.

This is similar to disabling check plugins, but not quite the same:
An SNMP section may be used by multiple check plugins, and it may or may
not be *required* by an individual check plugin.
Check plugins that require a section which has been disabled will not be
discovered subsequently.

<b>In Checkmk versions prior to 2.0.0, the check plugins that have been disabled
using the "Disabled Checks" rule also affected which SNMP sections were fetched
from the host during discovery. This is no longer the case.</b>

During the update process (when the configuration is updated via cmk-update-config)
we try to automatically deduce the SNMP sections that must be disabled, such that
during discovery the same sections will be ommited as prior to the update.
However, for very convoluted "Disabled Checks"-schemes, this migration step may
miss out on some sections, which as a result will be fetched unexpectedly.

We recommend to review the settings in the rulesets "Disabled checks" and
"Disabled and enabled sections (SNMP)" after the update.
