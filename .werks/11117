This werk only affect users who implemented their own plugins *and*
where creating HostLabels using the discovery function.

Plugins trying to create HostLabel instances will fail with a NameError.

The afore mentioned feature is no longer supported.
Creation of host labels can now only be implemented using the
new check API. It is done by passing a `host_label_function`
to the `register.agent_section` function. For details please
refer to the documentation.
