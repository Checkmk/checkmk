This werk enables the monitoring of a HP StoreOnce storage system via the REST API version 4.x and upwards. It is incompatible to the previously used API 3.x.
Use the software version of your HP StoreOnce appliance to choose the correct WATO rule:
<li> version > 4.x: Use WATO Rule "Check HPE StoreOnce via REST API 4.x"
<li> version < 4.x: Use WATO Rule "Check HPE StoreOnce"
