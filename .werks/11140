This werk picks a feature (werk 8143) originally only available in v1.6.0 into the master.

The following labels are discovered automatically for ESX based hosts in Checkmk:
{{cmk/vsphere_object:vcenter}}, {{cmk/vsphere_object:server}}, {{cmk/vsphere_object:vm}}.

Accordingly to the new introduces parse function, the inventory plugin is adapted.
