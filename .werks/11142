Previously, the agent plugin "mk_postgres" and the check plugin "postgres_connections" were not differentiating between "idle" and "active" connections.
With this werk, the data to differentiate those states is obtained and evaluated accordingly.

The WATO rule  "Database Connections (PostgreSQL)" (renamed from "Database Connections (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)") has now a dedicated option for setting the levels for "active" and "idle" connections.
In case the rule was used previously, the default connection type for PostgreSQL will be "active" as the old agent was excluding "idle" connections.

<b>Note:</b> As this WATO rule was applicable as well for MongoDB, this change will be incompatible to previously existing MongoDB rules set with "Database Connections (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)". If this is applicable for your setup, perform the following steps:

<li> If you're monitoring both PostgreSQL <b>and</b> MongoDB: keep the old rule "Database Connections (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)" before updating to this werk.</li>
<li> If you're monitoring MongoDB <b>only</b>: delete the old rule "Database Connections (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)" before updating to this werk</li>
<li> Create a new rule with your previous settings for MongoDB with the new rule "Database Connections (MongoDB)" </li>
