This change updates the optional extension package for the Prometheus suite. It introduces
the multi-nodes processing for the Node Exporter. This allows Checkmk to handle a Prometheus
instance where multiple Node Exporters are connected.
If the Prometheus package v1 was already in use, you should perform a Tabula Rasa after
upgrading to the package v1.1.
For a first installation, you can find this package in the Extension packages page. The
Prometheus package is listed as an optional extension package and becomes available to your
site after performing the "Install this package" action.
