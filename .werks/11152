Building on werk #11150, this werk extends the monitoring of Cisco VPN
sessions.

<ul>
<li>The services corresponding to this check are renamed from "[session type]
Sessions" to "VPN Sessions [session type]". This places them next to each other
in the Checkmk GUI.</li>
<li>In addition to the number of active sessions, the check now also reports peak
values and cumulative values as well as the global system limit on the number of
concurrent sessions.</li>
<li>Besides the number of client, clientless and remote access sessions, the check
now also monitors the number of LAN-to-LAN sessions, discovered as "IPsec L2L". For
clarity, the service monitoring the number of remote access sessions is renamed from
"IPsec" to "IPsec RA".</li>
<li>The check now additionally produces a service which reports the overall number of
active sessions (computed by summing over the individual session types).</li>
<li>In addition to Cisco PIX and ASA appliances, the check now also discovers Cisco
Firepower appliances.</li>
</ul>

This werk is incompatible. Users have to re-discover the services of affected
hosts.
