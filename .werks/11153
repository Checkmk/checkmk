This werk extends the following checks by an option to compute averaged
single-core CPU utilizations (previously, this was only possible for the total
CPU utilization): hr_cpu, huawei_switch_cpu, kernel.util, tplink_cpu,
winperf_processor.util. In particular, this option is now available for Linux/UNIX
(kernel.util) and Windows systems (winperf_processor.util).

To activate the averaging, use the option "Averaging for single cores" of the rules
"CPU utilization on Linux/UNIX" or "CPU utilization for simple devices" (depending on
the check). Note that, as described in the documentations of these rules, this option
only has an effect when used together with the sub-options "Apply single-core levels"
or "Graphs for averaged single-core utilizations".
