This werk fixes some issues with the monitoring of AWS RDS DBs:
<ul>
<li>The checks aws_rds.network_io and aws_rds.disk_io now yield correct rates.</li>
<li>The services produced by the checks aws_rds.transaction_logs_usage,
aws_rds.replication_slot_usage and aws_rds.agent_jobs are now discoverable, which wasn't
the case before due to a bug in the AWS special agent.</li>
<li>For PostgreSQL databases, the check aws_rds.replica_lag now additionally reports the
Cloudwatch metric OldestReplicationSlotLag, which wasn't the case before due to a bug in
the AWS special agent.</li>
<li>The rule "AWS/RDS Replica lag" for the check aws_rds.replica_lag has been adjusted to
allow for setting levels smaller than one second on the replication lag.</li>
This werk is incompatible. Depending on the used configuration, users should delete and
re-create the rules "AWS/RDS Replica lag".
