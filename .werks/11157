Title: AWS EC2 Limits

This werk fixes some small bugs in the monitoring of AWS EC2 limits (check
aws_ec2_limits). Before this werk, depending on the configuration, the
corresponding service might have been discovered for both the host running
the special agent and for one of the EC2 instances. Now, the service is
only discovered for the host running the special agent and all limits are
consistently reported there. Also, some default upper levels have been
adjusted to the latest AWS defaults.

This werk is incompatible. Users have to re-discover the services of affected
hosts.
