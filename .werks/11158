The rule "Filesystem grouping patterns" allows for arranging filesystems
discovered for example by the check <tt>df</tt> into groups. Up to now, the
rule only allowed for specifying patterns for including a filesystem in a
group. With this werk, the user can also specify exclusion patterns wich
prevent filesystems from becoming a member of a group.
