NetApp volumes collected by the NetApp special agent, which are monitored
by the check <tt>netapp_api_volumes</tt>, can now be grouped using the rule
"Filesystem grouping patterns". This allows for combining multiple volumes into
a single service. Services corresponding to grouped volumes deliver the same
performance data as individual volumes and are also configurable via the rule
"NetApp Volumes".

This werk is incompatible in the sense that it can result in unwanted grouping
of NetApp volumes. This will happen if user-defined rules for the grouping of
filesystems match services monitoring NetApp volumes. In this case, users have
to refine the corresponding rules.
