This check returns {{OK}} when the total number of client connections does not
fall below configurable levels. It shows the sum of connections for each
individual connection type.

The needed {{cisco_prime_wifi_access_points}} sections are generated by
{{agent_cisco_prime}} which has to be configured to fetch the required data
through the Cisco Prime API by providing the respective URL and connection
credentials.
