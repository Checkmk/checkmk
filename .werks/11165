Any Windows service can be marked  as <tt>Automatic (Delayed Start)</tt>. 
This mode means short wait for other Windows services marked as <tt>Automatic</tt>.
The delayed mode may help to have network services ready when the service starts, 
for example.

With this release Checkmk Windows Agent supports this mode.

<tt>Automatic (Delayed Start)</tt> mode  may be enabled using either config 
file or WATO.
