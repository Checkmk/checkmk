Prevously, you could configure the 'customer' entry for the default user
profile in global or site specific configuration of a site. This option was
removed because the standard user profile should always have the customer of
the site in question.

If you have used the rule "Default user profile" in global settings or site
specific global settings before, please update the configuration files as
follows:

<ul>
<li>If you just configured an explicit customer before, please use "reset to
default" once</li>
<li>If you have used one of the other configuration options like "User role",
please save the rule again</li>
</ul>
