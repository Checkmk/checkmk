Title: Fixed some wrong displayed parameters for hosts if cmc is used

If cmc is used as core, the default host check command is smart ping, not ping as shown before.
Also the normal and retry check interval for host checks is 6 seconds, not 1 minute.

Note: This was only a display error and didn't affect correct execution.
