If JIRA notifications are used in distributed environments the host and service
problem ID might not be unique, because every site core creates own host and
service problem IDs. This could lead to problems with ticket creation if the
notifications end up at the same JIRA instance because the problem ID might
already have been used.

If you use such setup, please configure the new option "Site custom field ID"
in the notification rule for JIRA. You also have to configure this ID in JIRA
(e.g. "CMK_SITE_FIELD") like the already configured host and service custom
field ID described in the article "Notifications via Jira" in our official
guide. The script will then set the host and service problem ID and the site
name on creation.

If Jira notifications are send from one site to one JIRA instance or from
different sites to different JIRA instances, no action is required. The Script
will use the old mechanism of setting and checking for host and service problem
IDs.

We will update the official guide shortly.
