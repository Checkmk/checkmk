This check returns {{OK}} when the percentage of non-operational access points
does not rise above configurable levels.
Default values are {{(20%, 40%)}}.
It shows the total number of access points as well as the number of
access points marked {{Critical}}, {{Minor}} or {{Cleared}}.

The needed {{cisco_prime_wifi_access_points}} sections are generated by
{{agent_cisco_prime}} which has to be configured to fetch the required data
through the Cisco Prime API by providing the respective URL and connection
credentials.
