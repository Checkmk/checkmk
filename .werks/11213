Title: ceph_status: OSDS check crashed when 'full' or 'nearfull' indicators are not available

The ceph_status storage check crashed when the OSDS check function attempted to
retrieve values for 'full' or 'nearfull' indicators, which are missing. We have
amended this function to allow the check to complete successfully when these
indicators are not available. This is relevant for ceph version after 13.2.7.
