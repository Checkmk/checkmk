This werk extends the special agent for monitoring UCS C-Series Rack Servers
to output information about LEDs and fault objects. It also adds two new checks
which monitor this data. The check ucs_c_rack_server_led monitors the colors of
all found LEDs and also provides their names and operational states. The check
ucs_c_rack_server_faultinst monitors fault objects such as degraded batteries.
It provides both a summary of all faults as well as detailed information about
each fault.
