This werk adds the option to inventorize the kernel configuration parameters
of Linux systems (output of <tt>sysctl -ae</tt>). To activate this option, two
configuration steps are necessary.

First, the user needs to deploy the corresponding agent plugin via the rule
"Hardware/Software-Inventory (Linux, Windows, Solaris, AIX)". Then, the checkmk
agents for Linux need to re-baked and re-installed to include the changes in the
agent plugin collecting the inventory data.

Secondly, the user needs to specify regex-patterns for including and excluding kernel
configuration parameters in the inventory via the rule "Inventory of Linux kernel
configuration (sysctl)". The reason for this second step is that some configuration
parameters can change often, resulting in frequent changes in the HW/SW inventory,
which can quickly fill up the temporary filesystem used by checkmk.
