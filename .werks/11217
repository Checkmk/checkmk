This werk adds the option to configure timeouts for the MSSQL agent
plugin (rule "Microsoft SQL Server (Windows)"). There are two types of
timeouts. The connection timeout is triggered when the agent plugin takes
too long to connect to an instance. The command timeout controls the
time available for executing commands such as SQL queries on the instances.

If a connection timeout is triggered, the plugin skips the entire instance
and continues with the next one. Note that this werk also changes the default
connection timeout from 2 seconds to the default value used by ADO (15 s).
In case of a command timeout, only the current command is skipped and the
plugin continues with the next command on the same instance.

Finally, this werk also fixes a bug in the handling of errors for the check
<tt>mssql_tablespaces</tt>. Errors such as timeouts reported by the agent
plugin are now displayed in the GUI and the check goes to CRITICAL instead of
UNKNOWN.
