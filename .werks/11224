The check <tt>winperf_phydisk</tt> now interprets the timespan parameter for
computing averaged values correctly (ruleset "Levels on disk IO (old style
checks)"). Previously, the user was supposed to specify a value in minutes,
however, the check plugin actually expected a value in seconds. This has been
corrected.

This change is incompatible, since the check plugin now behaves differently
for a given averaging timespan. User-defined rules might have to be adjusted
to account for this.
