This werk really fixes the intension of werk #10534:

The {{Check_MK discovery}} check was unable to discover entirely new
check_types.  Its discovery phase always relies on cached data, if available.
Since the SNMP datasource only fetches the data it actually needs, there is no
guarantee that all services will be discovered.

So the {{Check_MK discovery}} service failed to discover any interfaces, if the
snmp host did not have any interfaces beforehand.
Through WATO however, the discovery was successfull, since this mechanism may
bypass the snmp caching entirely.
