Example:
If you have configured the manual check {{State and count of processes}} and
there's another rule {{State and count of processes}} from {{Parameters for
discovered services}} which also matches on the manual check then the manual
parameters are overwritten with the parameters for discovered services.

This may concern all manual checks and the related parameters for discovered
services.
