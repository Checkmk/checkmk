If a Checkmk site is updated to a newer version but the agents of Windows hosts
are not, then the warning {{Unexpected allowed IP ranges}} may be displayed in
the details of the {{Check_MK}} service and the service state changes to
{{WARN}} (by default).
With this setting you can overwrite the default service state. This will help
you to reduce above warnings during the update process of your Checkmk sites
and agents.
We recommend to set this option only for the affected hosts as long as you
monitor agents older than Checkmk 1.7. After updating them, you should change
this setting back to it's original value.
There is also an {{Analyze Configuration Test}} {{Restricted address missmatch}}
below {{Security}} that informs you if there are configured rules which differ
from default state {{WARN}}.
