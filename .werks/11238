Title: Check_MK Discovery: Was unable to discover new SNMP check types
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: fix

Previously the {{Full scan}} option on the discovery page and the
{{Perform full SNMP scan always, detect new check types}} in the
{{Periodic service discovery}} ruleset had no effect. They always used the SNMP
scan cache, if available. In this case new check types were not detected. The
desired behaviour is using the SNMP cache if available and updating the SNMP
scan and data cache if not available.

With werk 10534 (1.6.0p11) and 11229 (1.6.0p14) another bug was introduced: The
{{Check_MK Discovery}} service, the {{Periodic service discovery}} and the
{{keepalive}} mode always fetched new data from the SNMP devices even if a
valid SNMP data cache is available. This led to higher query periods and
possible timeouts. The {{Check_MK Discovery}} services should use the existing
(valid) cache because the {{Check_MK}} service already updates it. Otherwise we
fetch new data.

Finally if new check types are detected by the SNMP scan mechnism and there's
no cached raw data of these new check types then the SNMP data for these check
types is fetched.
