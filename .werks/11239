Title: Check_MK Discovery: Revert werks 10534 and 11229
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

The original werks 10534 (1.6.0p11) and 11229 (1.6.0p16) tried to fix the
following situation:

The "Check_MK discovery" check was unable to discover entirely new check_types.
The discovery phase always relies on cached data, if available.  Since the SNMP
datasource only fetches the data it actually needs, there is no guarantee that
all services will be discovered.

So the "Check_MK discovery" service failed to discover any interfaces, if the
snmp host did not have any interfaces beforehand.  Through WATO however, the
discovery was successfull, since this mechanism may bypass the snmp caching
entirely.

We have to revert these werk because they did not have the effect to fix above
situation. In one of the next patch releases we will really fix this behaviour.
Sorry for that.. :(
