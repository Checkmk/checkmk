Within the ruleset {{Status of the Checkmk services}} there's a parameter
{{State in case of restricted address missmatch}} where you can overwrite the
default state {{WARN}} if the {{Check_MK}} service reports
{{Unexpected allowed IP ranges}}. This option was introduced in Checkmk version
1.6.0 and not handled by the {{Check_MK}} service, ie. the configure state of
this option had no effect.
