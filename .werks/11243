On the {{Bulk Discovery}} WATO page you could set the options
{{Use cached data if present}} and {{Do full SNMP scan for SNMP devices}}.
The latter one had no effect since Checkmk version 1.5.0. The idea behind the
option {{Do a full SNMP scan}} was contacting the SNMP device and ignoring
existing caches. This behaviour is implemented behind the option
{{Do a full service scan}} on the {{WATO Discovery}} page.

Moreover the {{Bulk Discovery}} page was inconsistent with the {{WATO Discovery}}
page - independent of above options. Thus we removed both options
{{Use cached data if present}} and {{Do full SNMP scan for SNMP devices}} and
add the option {{Do a full service scan}} in order to adapt the behaviour to
the discovery page. Now both pages work the same way.

Please note: With this new option a service scan of SNMP devices may take more
time as before because now this device will be contacted for real.
