There are two options {{Perform a full SNMP scan always, detect new check types}}
and {{Just rely on existing check files, detect new items only}} especially for
SNMP devices in the ruleset {{Periodic service discovery}}. The idea behind the
first option is contacting SNMP devices for real and possibly find new check
types. This option had no effect since Checkmk version 1.5.0 and cached data
was always used. The result was that the {{Check_MK Discovery}} service might
not have found new check typs on SNMP devices.

Now if this option is set Checkmk really contacts SNMP devices and may find new
check types and services.

Please note: The execution time of the {{Check_MK Discovery}} service may take
more time as before on hosts with SNMP data sources. In this case you can
increase the regular and retry check interval of this service using the ruleset
{{Normal check interval for service checks}} and {{Retry check interval for service checks}}
in order to prevent timeouts.
