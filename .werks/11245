Each user opening a dashboard is now able to apply custom filters to a dashboard
when viewing it. This can be done by opening the "Update context" dialog from
the dashboard menu.

From that menu it is possible to select one or multiple filters that will then
be used to filter the data shown by the dashboard.

This is much like the filter form in the views.

One additional feature has been added that can be used to enforce the user to
use one or multiple filters when initially opening a dashboard.

Imagine you want to have a dashboard that shows data of hosts in a given
hostgroup, for example you want to have a linux, windows, unix dashboard and so
on.

In previous versions you could build one dashboard and clone it multiple times
while changing the filter group name for each of the cloned dashboards.  That
would work, but you would end up with a lot of similar dashboards where only
the hard coded host group filter was different.

Now you can define a single dashboard and select the "Host is Group" filter in
the new "Required context filters" option from the dashboard properties. Once
you have done this, the dashboard will automatically open the "Dashboard Context"
dialog when initially opening the dashboard. After selecting the host group, the
dashboard will be rendered.

Btw.: You could also open the dashboard with the prefilled URL parameters to
prevent the "Dashboard Context" dialog from popping up.
