With this change we remove the Classic theme. Even though there are still many
fans of this theme who like to use our Classic Theme, we can no longer support
this theme in the future due to cost and effort.

Users of the Classic Theme will automatically be switched to the current
default theme.

The main reason for this change is that we will make massive changes to the
user interface of Checkmk with the upcoming version. We can easily implement
these changes in the modern and dark theme together. In addition, we would have
had to redesign and implement some of these in the Classic theme, which we
cannot afford.
