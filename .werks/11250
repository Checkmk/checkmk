Title: mkeventd_status: Check was showing wrong list of active host limits

The check was showing "host event limit active" for hosts which have not
reached the host event limit. This happened for hosts that had a host
individual limit configured (Using the ruleset "Host event limit") because
the check was only respecting the global host event limits.
