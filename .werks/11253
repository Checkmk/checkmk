Title: LIVESTATUS_TCP_ONLY_FROM: Allow IPv6 addresses to be configured
Level: 1
Component: omd
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0p15
Date: 1595930491
Class: fix

The previous versions prevented IPv6 addreses from being configured,
terminating a configuration change with a validation error. This is
now possible.

In addition a more helpful text has been added to the config dialog
to explain the different allowed formats.
