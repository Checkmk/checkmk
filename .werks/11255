In the views you have the option to execute commands on the visible
hosts or services. The most popular ones are the ones for setting
downtimes or acknowledging problems.

Significantly less used, but rather dangerous, commands include "Toggle
notifications", "Toggle active checks", "Toggle passive checks" and "clear
modified attributes".

These commands modify the behaviour of the core for the selected objects, e.g.
checks or notifications are deactivated, which overwrites the configuration of
the core. This can easily lead to confusion, as it is not very transparent for
which objects this modification is active.

The commands were previously only available by default for users with the role
"admin". We have now also withdrawn these rights from the role "admin" by
default.

Admins who still need these commands can reactivate the rights under "Roles &
Permissions" in the configuration.
