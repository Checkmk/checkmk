This change is only relevant in case you have custom GUI extensions that
implement custom HTML pages.

In case you do this, it is likely that you use the <tt>html.header</tt> or
<tt>html.top_heading</tt> methods. Once upgrading to 1.7 you will have to
update your code to hand over a breadcrumb as second argument.

This can be done like this:

C+:
from cmk.gui.plugins.main_menu.mega_menus import (
    make_simple_page_breadcrumb,
    MegaMenuSetup,
)

title = "My custom page"
html.header(title, make_simple_page_breadcrumb(MegaMenuSetup, title))
C-:

For more examples have a look at our code and search for the keyword
breadcrumb.
