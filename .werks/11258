With the versions starting with Checkmk 1.6.0p12 there were frequent problems
with the stability of live status connections, which did not occur permanently
but rather sporadically.

These problems manifested themselves in various ways (peaks in live status
usage graphs, slow responses from live status, slow reaction of the GUI or even
timeouts).

We have now reversed the relevant changes for the time being, so these problems
no longer occur with 1.6.0p15.
