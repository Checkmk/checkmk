In previous versions it was possible to create files in the querying Checkmk
site by modifying or extending an agent on a monitored system.

So an attacker who gained rights on a monitored system to extend the agent
could create and modify files in the monitoring Checkmk site with certain
modifications of the agent. The creation or modification of files in the
Checkmk site was done with rights of the Checkmk site user.

This problem is now solved by a better validation of hostnames of piggybacked
hosts. With this change only these characters are allowed in Piggybacked
hostnames: <tt>0-9a-zA-Z_.-</tt>. These are exactly the same characters that
Checkmk normally allows when creating hostnames. A special feature of Piggyback
hostnames is that all illegal hostnames are replaced by "_".

This change means that Piggyback hosts created with now invalid characters will
have to be created differently after this change so that they can continue to
be monitored.
