Previously failures of last discovery jobs were displayed in a red message box again.

This happened in the following situation: If a hostname was not resolveable the
discovery page displayed {{Failed to lookup IP address of HOST via DNS}}. After
an IP address was configured this message was shown again on the discovery page
but also a discovered services table. This behaviour is misleading.

Now the last error message is put in the current job details but will not be
displayed as a critical message again.
