The original check plugin {{if_fortigate}} uses the {{ifName}} under the guise
of {{ifAlias}} because on Fortigate devices the {{ifName}} contains the
technical interface names. By contrast {{ifDescr}} or {{ifAlias}} may contain
user defined names.

In the ruleset {{Network Interface and Switch Port Discovery}} under
{{Appearance of network interface}} the item can be specified: Either use the
{{Use index}}, {{Use description}} or {{Use alias}}.

With the incompatible werk 6638 the {{ifName}} was substituted with
{{ifAlias}}. This means that the technical interface names are not available
any more. This werk reverts the check plugin back to its original state: use
{{ifName}} as {{ifAlias}} in order to make these technical names available
again.

We cannot simply add another SNMP field because this may cause unforeseen
performance loss.

In the future we have to find a performant solution to make the following four
SNMP fields available for item names: {{ifIndex}}, {{ifName}}, {{ifDescr}} and
{{ifAlias}}.

Thus if you have configure {{Use alias}} in the ruleset
{{Network Interface and Switch Port Discovery}} under {{Appearance of network interface}}
on Fortigate devices you have to rediscover these hosts.
