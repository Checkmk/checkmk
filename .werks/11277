For some printers the mapping of the colorant did not match to the description of the service.
This mappings can vary depending on the manufacturer.
The generic mapping was replaced by using the correct link between description and colorant.

Before this fix and depending on the manufacturer the service description could have been wrong.
The result was a discrepancies between the service color name and the perf-o-meter color.
If your printer has such a difference, please make sure to rediscover your host services.
