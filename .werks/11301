For AWS services that deliver data at a daily interval (Costs & Usage, Glacier,
S3), the data cache of the AWS agent used to be valid for 24 hours from the
time the first request was made to the AWS API. We have made the caching
functionality dynamic such that the cache loses its validity if it does not
contain today's data, and a new request is made to the API.
