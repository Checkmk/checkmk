mssql_jobs is a new plugin that enables the monitoring of scheduled jobs on
Microsoft SQL Server. Each job is listed as a seperate service, for which the
following information is shown:

-job duration
-MSSQL job status
-outcome message
-step name at which the job failed (if applicable)
-last run
-next run

It is possible to set warn/crit levels for the job duration, in case the job or
schedule is inactive, and/or corresponding to the MSSQL job status.
Performance data is tracked in terms of job duration.
