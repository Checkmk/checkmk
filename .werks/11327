The plugins fileinfo.groups and filestats allow the user to monitor the size,
age and count of a group of files on the Linux filesystem. With this extension,
the rules for file size and age can be overwritten for specific files within a
particular group. This can be done by defining a filename or a regular
expression, and additional rules for those files. This functionality is
optional and can be activated by checking the 'Additional rules for files'
option in the "Size, age and count of file groups" and "Size, age and count of
file groups (mk_filestats)" rulesets respectively.
