The check nimble_latency measures the latency of read and write I/O operations.
The data is captured as the number of operations within several latency
ranges (e.g. 1-2 milliseconds, 2-5 milliseconds, etc.). The data was
reported as a time interval, rather than a count. This has been fixed, so that
the number of operations within each range is now now shown as a percentage
of the total number of operations across all the ranges.
