The AWS REST API allows the configuration of different levels of granularity of
the returned data points (e.g. data shown per day, hour, minute, etc.). The AWS
agent configured the granularity based on its caching interval, leading to
lower granularity than expected. The setting of the granularity has been
amended to use fixed values.
