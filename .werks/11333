The first time the AWS agent is executed, it stores data in a cache file and
only retrieves live data from the AWS API once the data in this file is
considered out-of-date, or the configuration of the agent has changed. This is
especially useful, because AWS charges a fee for each query to the API. The
mechanism for determining whether the configuration of the agent has changed
contained a defect, leading to undeterministic configuration signatures, which
the agent erroneously interpreted as a configuration change. This has been
fixed.
