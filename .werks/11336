Title: mkp_prometheus: addition of mkp version 1.3
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0p17
Date: 1597824054
Class: feature

This change updates the optional extension package for the Prometheus suite.
The version 1.3 introduces a new connection option using the host name instead of the IP address.
Furthermore, it also introduces a new default check: the Prometheus Build check.
This check outputs general information concerning the Prometheus server itself. Furthermore,
it also helps to resolve previous stale problems with Piggyback information.

If the Prometheus package v1 was already in use, you should perform a Tabula Rasa
after upgrading to the package v1.3. In addition, you also may have to reconfigure
your existing Prometheus rules for correct behavior. For a first installation, you
can find this package in the Extension packages page. The Prometheus package is listed
as an optional extension package and becomes available to your site after performing
the "Install this package" action.

Note that before installing this extension, you should remove any installed previous versions
to avoid conflicts.
