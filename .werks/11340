At the moment (md-)checks turn md-service into warning state, because they come with "finish" and "speed" values.
(md-)checks are "By default, run at 00:57 on every Sunday, but do nothing unless the day of the month is less than or equal to 7 [...]".
A (md-)check is no rebuild or resync, it's just a periodic check and should degrade the state of the raid.
