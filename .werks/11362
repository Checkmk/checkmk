The discovery of the services provided by the check <tt>rmon_stats</tt>,
which monitors RMON statistics, used to be configured via the ruleset
"Network Interface and Switch Port Discovery". However, <tt>rmon_stats</tt>
does not honor any of the other settings provided by this ruleset. Therefore,
the service discovery for <tt>rmon_stats</tt> is now configured via the new,
separate ruleset "Monitor RMON statistics".

This werk is marked as incompatible because users who configured
<tt>rmon_stats</tt> to be discovered have to adjust their rulesets
accordingly. This is done by activating the discovery of <tt>rmon_stats</tt>
for the corresponding hosts using the new ruleset "Monitor RMON statistics".
Without this step, the corresponding services will continue to work but will
disappear if a re-discovery is performed.
