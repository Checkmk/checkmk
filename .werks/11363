This werk is only relevant for users who are currently monitoring the admin status
<tt>ifAdminStatus</tt> of switch ports (check plugin <tt>if64adm</tt>).

The 64-bit version of the interface check for switch ports can be configured to
also monitor the admin status <tt>ifAdminStatus</tt>. Up to now, if this option
was activated, Checkmk used the check plugin <tt>if64adm</tt> instead of
<tt>if64</tt>. Furthermore, only an <tt>ifAdminStatus</tt> of 2 was reported by
setting the port state to <i>9 - admin down</i>. With this werk, the admin
status is monitored completely separately from the port state. Consequently, the
port state <i>9 - admin down</i> is not available any more.

Previously, the monitoring of the admin state was activated implicitly by configuring
Checkmk to discover ports in the state <i>9 - admin down</i> (rule "Network Interface
and Switch Port Discovery"). Now, this is handled via the rule for including and
excluding SNMP sections ("Include or exclude SNMP sections"). If and only if the section
<tt>if64adm</tt> is enabled via this rule, the admin status will be monitored,
independently of the configuration in "Network Interface and Switch Port Discovery".

Furthermore, since the admin status is now reported separately from the port state,
it can also be used to configure 1) the discovery of network interfaces (rule "Network
Interface and Switch Port Discovery"), 2) the monitoring state (rule "Network interfaces
and switch ports"). For example, you can make Checkmk discover only interfaces with
an admin status of 2 or you can set the monitoring state of all interfaces with an
admin status of 1 to WARNING. Note that these configuration options only have an effect
if the admin status is actually monitored, i.e., if the section <tt>if64adm</tt> is
enabled.

Moreover, contrary to before, from now on, no re-discovery is necessary after activating
or deactivating the monitoring of the admin status. This is because this werk combines the
check plugins <tt>if64</tt> and <tt>if64adm</tt> into a single plugin called <tt>if64</tt>.

This change is incompatible for all users who are currently monitoring the admin
status using <tt>if64adm</tt>. These users should follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Activate the monitoring of the admin status by enabling the section <tt>if64adm</tt>
via the rule "Include or exclude SNMP sections".</li>
<li>Check the discovery configuration (rule "Network Interface and Switch Port
Discovery"). As mentioned above, the admin state can now be used to further refine the
discovery of network interfaces. On the other hand, the port state <i>9 - admin down</i>
is not available any more, so users might have to adjust their configurations.</li>
<li>Re-discover the services of affected hosts.</li>
<li>Check the monitoring configuration (rule "Network interfaces and switch ports").
Analogously to the discovery configuration, the admin state can now be used to set
the monitoring state of network interfaces and the port state <i>9 - admin down</i>
is not available any more.</li>
<li>Finally, check if there are any rules of the type "Bulk walk: Limit SNMP OID ranges"
where the option "SNMP interface check with 64 bit counters using admin states (using v2c)"
is selected (this will now be displayed as "Element 'if64adm' does not exist anymore").
Change these to "SNMP interface check with 64 bit counters (using v2c)". This is necessary
because, as mentioned above, the check plugin <tt>if64adm</tt> does not exist any more.
</li>
</ul>
