The check <tt>if_lancom</tt> monitors network interfaces of LANCOM devices
using 64-bit SNMP counters. Since there are devices with broken firmware which
by mistake report that they support 64-bit counters, checkmk offers the rule
"Hosts forced to use 'if' instead of 'if64'". This rule enforces the usage of
the 32-bit SNMP interface check <tt>if</tt> over the 64-bit version.

Up to now, the check <tt>if_lancom</tt> did not fully apply this rule. I.e.,
depending on the device, even if this rule was activated, <tt>if_lancom</tt>
might still have been discovered. With this werk, <tt>if_lancom</tt> is never
discovered if "Hosts forced to use 'if' instead of 'if64'" is activated.

This change might be incompatible for users who activated the rule "Hosts forced
to use 'if' instead of 'if64'". Currently discovered services will continue to
work, however, upon rediscovery, <tt>if_lancom</tt> might be replaced by <tt>if</tt>.
In such cases, users have to further restrict the hosts to which this rule is applied.
