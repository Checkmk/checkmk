The discovery of the services corresponding to the check <tt>brocade_optical</tt>,
which monitors the signal quality of the optical ports of Brocade switches, is
configurable via the rule "Network Interface and Switch Port Discovery". As announced
in werk #11361, this rule has been reworked.

With this werk, we adjust <tt>brocade_optical</tt> to the new version of the discovery
ruleset for network interfaces. This check now uses the discovery ruleset for network
interfaces the same way as all other interface checks and is thus consistent with werk
#11361, which was not the case before. However, note that, as before,
<tt>brocade_optical</tt> does not implement all of the options offered by this
discovery rule. The grouping of interfaces is not supported and the items are always
given by the port numbers, independently of the option chosen under "Appearance of
network interface". Furthermore, out of the six matching conditions offered by the rule,
this check supports only the following three: the matching of the port type, the matching
of the port state and the matching of the interface description.

This werk is incompatible. Currently discovered services will continue to work, however,
upon re-discovery, some services might vanish or new services might be discovered. This
depends on the user-defined rules from the ruleset "Network Interface and Switch Port
Discovery". In such cases, users have to adjust their rules. Note that the default
behavior of the check has not changed. Hence, this werk is compatible for users with no
corresponding user-defined rules.
