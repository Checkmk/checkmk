This werk is only relevant for users who are currently using the ruleset "Hosts
forced to use 'if' instead of 'if64'".

The rule "Include or exclude SNMP sections", which allows users to disable individual
SNMP sections, will now replace the more specific rule for enforcing the usage of
the 32- instead of the 64-bit interface check ("Hosts forced to use 'if' instead
of 'if64'"). As of this werk, the latter rule is deprecated. To make Checkmk fall
back to the 32-bit interface check, use "Include or exclude SNMP sections" to disable
the corresponding 64-bit section (mostly <tt>if64</tt>).

This werk is incompatible only for users who actually activated the rule "Hosts
forced to use 'if' instead of 'if64'". As described above, such users have
to deactivate the section <tt>if64</tt>, otherwise, upon re-discovery, Checkmk
will start to use the check plugin <tt>if64</tt> instead of <tt>if</tt>. Note
that besides the check plugin <tt>if64</tt>, the rule "Hosts forced to use 'if'
instead of 'if64'" could also be used to make Checkmk use <tt>if</tt> instead of
<tt>if_brocade</tt> and <tt>if_lancom</tt>. This option is still available,
however, in these two particular cases, users will have to deactivate both the
sections <tt>if_brocade</tt>/<tt>if_lancom</tt> and <tt>if64</tt>. If only the
former were deactivated, Checkmk would fall back to <tt>if64</tt>.
