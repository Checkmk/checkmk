This werk enhances the check plugin <tt>windows_tasks</tt>. This plugin can now
handle all of the exit codes of Windows tasks specified under
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/task-scheduler-error-and-success-constants.
Previously, the check plugin could only handle some of these exit codes and went
CRIT if it encountered an unknown exit code. Furthermore, the check plugin now
discovers any task which is not disabled. Previously, only tasks in the state
"Enabled" were discovered.

Moreover, the check plugin is now user-configurable via the new ruleset "Windows
Tasks". Here, users can modify the default mapping of exit codes to monitoring
states used by the check and users can also change the text produced by the check
plugin for a given exit code. Finally, users can also change the monitoring state
for tasks which are not enabled (the default monitoring state in such cases used
to be CRIT, it is now WARN).
