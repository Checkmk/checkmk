With werk #10850 we introduced a fix for possible problems with upper and
lower case instances in 1.6.0p15. It made a match possible where the process
is lower case but the specific login variable definition in the configuration
file is upper case - or vice versa. This fix is incompatible with Bash
versions that are older than 4.0 and has been enhanced with this werk.

You need to replace the plugin only if you are running Oracle Databases
on an OS that uses an older version of Bash and you noticed a failed login
after upgrading to 1.6.0p15. Otherwise there is no need for interaction.
