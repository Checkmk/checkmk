The services created by the check plugin oracle_performance included
several groups of performance data. To be able to create more detailed views,
the information provided by this check plugin can now be splitted in up to
three different services:

LI:oracle_performance: Statistics for the buffer pool and library cache are still in the main service and cannot be moved into a separate service.
LI:oracle_performance.dbtime: Statistics for the used DB times (CPU and Non-Idle Wait) may be isolated as a separate service.
LI:oracle_performance.memory: Memory information may also be isolated. If so, additionally statistics for PGA will be computed and displayed.

To use this new feature, the ruleset "Oracle performance discovery" has
been implemented. The isolation of DB times or memory statistics can be
configured independently to represent your specific requirements. If this
ruleset is not used, all behaviour will stay the same as before - there is
no need for interaction in this case.

<b>Important</b>: Please be aware, that there is no automatic conversion of
rrd data in case, you split up the services. This means, that you need to
convert them manually, if you are using the single rrd format. Otherwise the
historic metric data will still be available through the main service only
while the new metric data will be stored in the newly created services.
