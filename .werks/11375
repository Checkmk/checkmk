With this change, new statistics for IO and system waits are added
optionally. These statistics need to be activated through the rule "Oracle
performance discovery". They are not automatically available since the
activation of these statistics may produce a lot of additional metric data. So
this data will created only, if you decide so.

To use the feature, you need to replace the agent plugin with the newest
version and activate the new services through the mentioned ruleset above. You
will be able to add up to three new services:

LI:oracle_performance.iostat_ios: IO statistics displayed as raw IOs.
LI:oracle_performance.iostat_bytes: IO statistics displayed in bytes.
LI:oracle_performance.waitclasses: Details about the reasons the DB spends time waiting.

<b>Important</b>: As fetching statistics about IOs may take a long time in some
configurations, these data is fetched through the agent plugin asynchronously by default with
section name iostats. If you change this section to synchronously, which
is recommended in most cases, please check if you are able to optimize you
indexing if needed to avoid such problems.
