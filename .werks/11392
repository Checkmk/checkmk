After werk #11042 pacemaker-controld is a target process required to
trigger the heartbeat_crm section in Linux and openwrt agents. The way such
process was found was susceptible to name collisions leading to the
discovery of fictuos services, because other processes on the same host
could be accessing the same service.

This werk makes it more strict to catalog only pacemaker-controld processes.
