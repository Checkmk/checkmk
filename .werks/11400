Previously, an IP restriction for the access to the Checkmk agent, as configured in
WATO ruleset "Allowed agent access via IP address", could only be realized with the
help of an "only_from" entry at the xinetd service that is shipped with a baked
agent package.

With this Werk, the restriction is also realizable via "IP Access Lists" for the
Checkmk agent systemd service/socket. Depending on the configuration of the
"Checkmk agent network service" WATO ruleset, a configured IP restriction will be
realized activating either the systemd service/socket, or the xinetd service, with
the systemd service/socket being the default.

There is no action needed to activate this new behavior.

The benefit of this change is, that you won't need to install xinetd any more to
realize an IP restriction, but can rely on systemd, that is standard on most Linux
distributions.

<b>Note</b>: The feature "IP Access Lists" is supported by systemd versions >= 235
only. The agent installation will check for a sufficient version and prevent the
systemd service/socket from being activated, if the check fails. Depending on the
"Checkmk agent network service" configuration, the installation will try to fall
back to the xinetd service, see also Werk #10431.
