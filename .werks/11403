Previously, when updating a baked agent via a package manager, you would eventually
receive a warning about a downgrade of the Checkmk agent. The reason for this was the
baked agent's version string, that was formed of Checkmk version and the agent's configuration
hash, with the latter being quite random and thus confusing the package manager, that expects
an increasing versioning. E.g. a version string could be <tt>1.6.0p18.f123abcd</tt> before bake,
and <tt>1.6.0p18.1234cdef</tt> after bake.

This behavior is now fixed by introducing an internal bake revision, that increases on every
newly baked package (per Checkmk version) and that's only purpose is to guarantee an
increasing version string for the .rpm, .deb and .pkg packages (e.g. <tt>1.6.0p18-1.f123abcd</tt>
before bake, <tt>1.6.0p18-2.1234cdef</tt> after bake). Please note that this revision won't
be visible on the GUI or in the package's filenames, it only affects the package's metadata.
