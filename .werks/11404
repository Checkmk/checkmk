Previously, the only property that has been observed by the agent bakery to decide whether
to bake new agents, was the WATO agent configuration. This sometimes lead to problems when
deploying your own plugins, because changes in agent plugin files won't get recognized and
hence no new agent would get baked. Furthermore, if you managed to force-bake the agents,
including the file changes, the config hash would still stay the same, hence the agent updater
would refuse to deploy the new package to the hosts.

The agent bakery will now recognize changes in every file that gets deployed to the configured
agent packages and reflect them in generating a different agent hash on baking agents. This is
also true for files that get superceded by their counterpart at the local hierarchy, see Werk #10975.

Similar to a config change, changes in underlying files will lead to a highlighted "Bake agents"
button at the agent bakery.

Please note that this mechanism will only work for bakery plugins that are specified via
the new Bakery API, see Werk #11401. This includes all builtin bakery plugins. E.g., if you
decide to adapt the Checkmk linux agent (copy an adapted version to the local hierarchy),
your changes will get recognized.
