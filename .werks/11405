With the introduction of the new Bakery API (see Werk #11401), the
Agent Bakery itself has undergone a complete overhaul.

While baking agents, the agent bakery now tries to reuse as many
resources as possible, instead of collecting data for every
package separately. If the contents for a to-be-baked package are
identical to an already-baked one, this optimization will be communicated
as "fast repackage" (visible at the bake-agents background
job within the GUI or at the console directly when baking on the command
line).

Furthermore, the packaging processes for RPM and DEB packages have been
optimized in performance.

In summary, you will experience an agent bakery that runs noticeably
faster and finishes earlier, compared to Checkmk 1.6 and before.
