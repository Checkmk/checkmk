Additional to "Input bandwith" and "Output bandwidth" metrics, a "Total
bandwidth" metric, that sums up the incoming and outcoming traffic, can
now be activated for network interface checks.

You can activate the metric by applying the "Activate total bandwidth metric
(sum of in and out)" checkbox within the "Network interfaces and switch
ports" ruleset. There, you can also optionally set levels, that work the same
way as they do for the input and output bandwidth metrics.
