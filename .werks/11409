As an addition to the reworked "Network interface and switch port discovery"
ruleset, as described in Werk #11361, it is now possible to automatically
generate service labels via discovery.

You can specify a set of labels each for all discovered single interfaces and
for all discovered interface groups per created "Network interface and switch
port discovery" rule. To achieve this, you have to activate and fill the entries
"Generate service labels...", that can be found under the congurations for single
interfaces, and interface groups, respectively.

In order to apply the configured labels, you have to (re)discover the services
that correspond to the matching interfaces and interface groups.
