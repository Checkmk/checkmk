Since this release Windows Agent update plugin is delivered as a python file
with name <tt>cmk_update_agent.checkmk.py</tt>

This feature has next advantages:
<ul>
<li>eliminates false virus alarms for the plugin</li>
<li>improves stability and performance</li>
<li>speeds up development</li>
<li>improves diagnostic</li>
</ul>

To use the plugin from the command line you may use provide next methods:

1. Use Windows agent:
C+:
cd "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\checkmk\service"
check_mk_agent updater [params]
C-:
2. Use provided with Windows agent Python module:
C+:
cd "%ProgramData%\checkmk\agent\plugins"
..\modules\Python-3.8\.venv\Scripts\python cmk_update_agent.checkmk.py [params]
C-:

In both cases <tt>params</tt> means parametres of the Windows agent updater plugin.

You could even execute the Agent updater with another Python installation, but it 
is not recommended, because you would have to ensure that all module dependencies 
are installed in your environment. We have solved this problem for you by providing 
a standard Python environment for Windows, so it should be used.
