Previously Windows Agent can't process registry entries with type REG_EXPAND_SZ 
containing environment variable(s).

For example ImagePath="%ProgramFiles(x86)%\checkmk\service\check_mk_agent.exe" 
had not been expanded to the "c:\Program Files (x86)\checkmk..."

This may lead to Agent malfunction on some Windows installation.

With this release Windows agent fully supports einvironment variables embedded 
in registry entries thus eliminating the problem.
