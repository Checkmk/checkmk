Previously, calling Windows agent using full path may produce weird results.

Errouneously Windows agent used case-sensitive comparison for filepaths, which 
in Windows are case insensitive. For example such command line
<tt>"c:\program files (x86)\checkmk\service\checmk_mk_agent.exe" test</tt> didn't 
work correctly. But command line which uses correct letter case
<tt>"C:\Program Files (x86)\checkmk\service\checmk_mk_agent.exe" test</tt> worked 
fine.

With this release the problem had been eliminated. You may use any letter case in 
the path to the Windows agent.
