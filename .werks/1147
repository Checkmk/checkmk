Title: upc_capacity, ups_socomec_capacity: Fix checking of battery left levels
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

The fixes the execution of the levels for <i>Time left on battery</i>. These
levels where internally compared against the <i>Time running on battery</i>
- which is obviously quite the opposite.

Example: If you configure a warning level of <tt>50</tt> minutes for <i>Time
left on battery</i> then the check gets critical if the estimated remaining
battery time is 50 minutes or less.
