Title: Fixed default LDAP synchronization setting of central sites
Class: fix

The default setting for "Sync with LDAP connections" in the connection settings
of central sites showed "Disabled user synchronization (use master site
users)". If you saved this page, because of changes in other settings, this
default setting was set for the site in question, leading to missing
synchronizations on that site.

From now on the default for central sites is "Sync users with all connections"
as stated in the inline help.
