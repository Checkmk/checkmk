In previous versions, the site configuration option
"Direct login to Web GUI allowed" was intended to influence the synchronisation when activating changes.
When enabled, the related site was marked for synchronisation every time a Web GUI related option is changed in the central site.

From now on, this option <b>also</b> controls whether a login is allowed on a site or not.

Please check this option in your current configuration.
