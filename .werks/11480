From now on, the sysDescr is parsed for the following strings:

<li>appliance</li>
<li>firewall</li>
<li>printer</li>
<li>router</li>
<li>sensor</li>
<li>switch</li>
<li>ups</li>
<li>wlc</li><br>

If one string (foo in this example) is found, the host will discover the host
label <b>"cmk/device_type:foo"</b>.

Because sysDescr is the only reliable way to get the device type from a snmp
device, but not every description contains the strings above, we also have to add
device specific host labels via the regarding check plugins. This will be added
with further werks.

The implementation takes care, that the device specific host label always wins
about the strings in snmp_info and mgmt_snmp_info.
