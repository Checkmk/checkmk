If you used the option "LDAP attribute to sync" for "Disable Notifications" in
a LDAP connection, the Users page crashes with "AttributeError ('unicode'
object has no attribute 'get')".

The reason is, that the attribute from the LDAP sync is a boolean, that returns
"True" or "FALSE" in unicode.

From now on, the GUI can handle this kind of format.
