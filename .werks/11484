The only difference of check plugins for Management Boards was the resulting
service description. In case, the plugin was related to a Management Board, the
prefix "Management Interface:" was set by the check plugin.

As the discovery now handles this scenario, the explicit check plugins are not
needed any more.

Note:
If you use local checks that use plugin sections that have an equivalent
Management Board section, changes on that checks also affect the processing of
the Management Board plugin section, e.g. <<<snmp_info>>> on
<<<mgmt_snmp_info>>>.
