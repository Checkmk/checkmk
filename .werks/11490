During the activation of configuration changes we have multiple subsequent steps:

LI: Acquire the activation lock
LI: Create the core config (incl. backup and restore in case of issues)
LI: Precompile some more files for the core
LI: Restart of the core or reload of the config

The most common commands to execute the activation or parts of the procedure
are "cmk -U" for just creating the configuration or "cmk -O" for creating the
configuration and reloading the core config and "cmk -R" for creating the
configuration and restarting the core process.

The commands "cmk -B" (Create core config) and "cmk -C" (precompile some files)
were providing direkt access to parts of the "cmk -U" command but rarely used.

To simplify things we are now dropping both, the "cmk -B" and "cmk -C"
commands. If you used one of these before, please use "cmk -U" in the future.
