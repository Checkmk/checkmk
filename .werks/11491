Title: Nagios: Fix broken config reason displaying
Level: 1
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0p18
Date: 1600080986
Class: fix

This issue is only affecting Checkmk installations that use the Nagios core.
In case a configuration error occurs, the reason for this issue should be displayed
in the console or the GUI like this: "When Validating Nagios configuration...ERROR: REASON".

However, since release v1.6.0p4 the output of the config validation was not shown to the user.
Instead this text was shown instead: "Validating Nagios configuration...ERROR: Configuration Error: local variable 'cmk' referenced before assignment"
