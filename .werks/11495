Dokuwiki has been delivered with Checkmk since the introduction of OMD. It has
certainly helped some users to quickly create documentation in their monitoring
site. But for Checkmk 2.0 we decided to remove Dokuwiki from the standard
packages.

The Dokuwiki package causes increased effort and complexity because it has to
be maintained by us, including the plugins that have been selected and
implemented. The main problem here is: We support different Linux distros in
different versions. These platforms provide different PHP versions by default
(currently PHP 5.4 to 7). To all these versions we have to keep Dokuwiki and
the plugins compatible. Upstream, however, Dokuwiki has removed support for
such old PHP versions. This would increase the effort for us significantly if
we want to support all platforms equally well.

If you have been using Dokuwiki in a Checkmk site so far, there are ways to do
so. Dokuwiki can be installed into the local hierarchy of a site and run from
there. You are responsible for the installation and maintenance of the
installation yourself. It would even be possible to create an MKP to share the
installation with other users.

The Checkmk sidebar snapin "Wiki" has also been removed from Checkmk. If
you want to use it, you can find it at
"share/doc/check_mk/treasures/wiki_sidebar_snapin.py" in your site. Copy
the file to "local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/sidebar/" and restart your
site apache to make the snapin available to the GUI.
