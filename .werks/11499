In previous Checkmk versions the login sessions were not tracked on the Checkmk
server side.  This means that a logout in the GUI was a pure client action
destroying the authentication cookie. When the cookie was stored and reused
later, the user was able to access the GUI again with that old login session
which was logged out.

This change extends the authentication cookie with a session ID which has to be
known on the Checkmk server to result in a successful login. Once a login
session is logging out from the GUI, the session is invalidated on the Checkmk
server.  If a client tries to access the GUI with an invalidated authentication
cookie, the login will be rejected from now.

Please note that we have added some limitations with this change:

<ul>
<li>Per user we can now have up to 20 parallel login sessions. Once a user
    account reaches the 21st sessions, the session with the longest inactivity will
    be invalidated.</li>
<li>Existing sessions with an inactivity of more than 7 days will be invalidated.</li>
</ul>

The change of the authentication cookie requires all users to login again to the
GUI after updating to Checkmk 2.0, because the cookie format is now incompatible
with the authentication cookies issued by previous Checkmk versions.

We use the incompatibility to switch the authentication cookie hashing
algorithm from to sha256. The previous md5 at this point was not a security
problem, but it can be considered bad practice.
