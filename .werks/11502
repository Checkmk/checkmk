Title: Dynamic host configuration: Fix config activation on WATO enabled remote sites

The dynamic host configuration is working in a special mode in distributed
setups. The dcd on the remote site is executed to collect the information about
the hosts locally and the dcd on the central site is processing this
information and applies the changes in the central configuration.

There was a case where the remote DCD operated in central mode, instead of
remote site mode which made the DCD activate change on the remote site. This
might result in pending changes on the remote site which in turn prevents an
activation of changes from the central site.

Technical details: This was caused by a "config reload" command being sent to
the DCD before the DCD configuration was completely synchronized.
