Some builtin or own views may take longer time than expected. In order to
detect slow views you have to set
<ul>
<li>the log level to <b>DEBUG</b> at <b>Setup > General > Global settings > User Interface > Log levels > Slow views</b>,</li>
<li>a threshold (in seconds) at <b>Setup > General > Global settings > User Interface > Threshold for slow views</b>.</li>
</ul>
The logging is disable by default. The default threshold is set to 60 seconds.
If enabled one log entry per view rendering that exceeeds the configured
threshold is logged to <b>var/log/web.log</b> and contains the following
information:
<ul>
<li>View name</li>
<li>User which called this view</li>
<li>Row limit</li>
<li>Limit Type (none, soft or hard)</li>
<li>URL variables</li>
<li>View context (eg. filters)</li>
<li>#Unfiltered rows</li>
<li>#Filtered rows</li>
<li>#Rows after above limit</li>
<li>Duration of fetching rows via livestatus</li>
<li>Duration of filtering rows</li>
<li>Duration of rendering the view</li>
<li>Duration of rendering/processing the whole page</li>
</ul>
