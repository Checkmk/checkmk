Previously we only checked {{<...,UP>}} in the bracket info and treated this
interface as {{UP}} if and only if no output of ethtool is available.

Please have a look at the following scenarios and how we now determine whether
an interface is {{UP}}:
<ul>
<li>{{<BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP>}} means that this interface has a link
and is UP</li>
<li>{{<NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP>}} means that this interface is
configured and ADMIN UP but has no link</li>
<li>{{<BROADCAST,MULTICAST>}} means that this interface is not configured</li>
</ul>
