The fileinfo.groups check reports when a service does not have a corresponding
grouping pattern saved in the rules configuration file. This is important so
that missing grouping patterns can be addressed. However, this error is not
relevant when the agent is unable to find files. In such an event, the check
continues to run normally and check values for count and overall file size
against the specified levels.
