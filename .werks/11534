With the feature "Additional Rules for Files" enabled, the fileinfo.groups
check excluded files that matched to one of these additional rules from the
count and size of files of the whole file group. The check has been amended so
that it counts and adds file sizes of all files within the file group,
regardless of any additional rules defined.
