The job check monitors processes on Linux. Killed jobs were falsely flagged as
running jobs, wich could potentially lead to a crash with an obscure error
message: raise ValueError("Cannot render negative timespan"). This has been
fixed, so that killed jobs are shown as terminated jobs and are only reported
if they are the latest instance of the job.
