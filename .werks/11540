In case a Nutanix Prism Cluster was configured to use the alert check ({prism_alerts}) an alert
addressing a certain VM could have been reported twice since it would have also been reported
with the Prism Central instance (which would then always have the worst state of all monitored
VMs).
This change introduces a check option {prism_central_only} which set to True would consider only
alerts addressing Prism Central VM (set in {vm_type} element of the alert context).
