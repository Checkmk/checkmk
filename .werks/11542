Title: WATO rules for active check check_sql forgets values for SQL queries

Parameters for {check_sql} have been specified in an overly complicated and buggy way which allowed
specification of single line and multi line SQL query statements as well as uploading content from
local files.
This fix replaces all this with a single multi-line text input field.
