Title: Swap perfometer definitions for fs_size/_usage and dedup_rate

In case a check provides metrics for deduplication rate ({{dedup_rate}}) and filesystem
usage ({{fs_size}} and {{fs_usage}}) the Perf-O-Meter would display the (less important)
deduplication rate.
This change makes perfometer definition for {{dedup_rate}} appear after {{fs_size}} and
{{fs_usage}}.
