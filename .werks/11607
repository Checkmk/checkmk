All web pages served by Checkmk will now have the HTTP header <tt>Header always
set X-Content-Type-Options: "nosniff"</tt> set.  It prevents a client from
guessing the content type based on the provided file. This is a way to opt out
of MIME type sniffing, or, in other words, to say that the MIME types are
deliberately configured.
