When a user clones e.g. a public shared bookmark list of another user, the
"public" flag was inherited during that clone operation and the cloned bookmark
list was shared to other users despite the fact that the user was not permitted
to share things to other users.

This change adds an information about the visibility to other users to the edit
page of these elements: "The view is only visible to you. You can not share it,
because you don't have the permission to share it."

The permission of the owner to share elements is now explicitly checked when
trying accessing the elements as another user.

Besides the bookmark list other elements like custom snapins, custom graphs,
forecast graphs, SLAs, graph collections and graph tunings were also affected.
