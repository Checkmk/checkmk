In general cached sections are marked with two timestamps:
<ul>
<li>the timestamp of the data collection (resp. execution)</li>
<li>the timestamp until when the section is treated as valid</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

On the Checkmk server the service columns {{checked}} or {{age}} display the
evaluated timestamps.

Custom SQLs of the {{mk_oracle}} can be declared as asynchrounous sections and
are executed in different intervals. In order to see the cached information for
{{Oracle Custom SQLs}} you have to re-install the mk_oracle plugin.
