The license usage report should NOT contain sites, hosts and services which are
used for test scenarios.  Due to a lot of different scenarios we need a
flexible way for excluding these test scenarios from the reports.

Let's begin at atom level. A service can be excluded by adding the label
{cmk/licensing:excluded}. For example you can do that via the ruleset
{Setup > Services > Service monitoring rules > Service labels}.

In order to exclude a host and all it's services you only have to label this
host with {cmk/licensing:excluded}. In this case you do not need additional
labels for the host services. Adding a host label can be achieved with the
ruleset {Setup > Hosts > Host monitoring rules > Host labels}.

If you want to exclude a whole site you can use the host label ruleset
{Setup > Hosts > Host monitoring rules > Host labels} for ALL hosts.

Thus, the idea is the following: if a higher level entity (eg. a host) is
already excluded then the lower level entities (eg. host services) do not have
to be excluded again. This also may reduce the number of rulesets.
