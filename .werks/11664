Title: Fix AttributeError on update with nagios core

Updating from 1.6.0pxx to 2.0.0b1 could result in an AttributeError
"module 'cmk.base' has no attribute 'cee'" in section "Migrating fs_used name".

The cause was a wrong check for the used core of the site the update was applied
to.

If you update to 2.0.0b2 the section will be processed correctly.
