This werk adds the new commandline option "<tt>--detect-sections</tt>" to the <tt>cmk -I my_host</tt>,
<tt>cmk -i my_host</tt> and <tt>cmk my_host</tt> commands.

It is mainly a debugging feature for check and inventory plugin developers; regular users are most unlikely
to ever need it.

Setting this option to a comma separated list of section names will have the effect that no more than the
passed sections are available to the check or inventory plugins (depending on the command).

SNMP sections will be fetched without SNMP detection.

For instance if you execute <tt>cmk -II --detect-sections=hr_mem,uptime my_host</tt>, a rediscovery
on <i>my_host</i> will be done, with (only) the sections <i>hr_mem</i> and <i>uptime</i> available.
Note that the SNMP table corresponding to the <i>hr_mem</i> section will be fetched from the host,
regardles of whether this host supports this MIB.
