This werk adds the new commandline option "<tt>--detect-plugins</tt>" to the <tt>cmk -I my_host</tt>,
<tt>cmk -i my_host</tt> and <tt>cmk my_host</tt> commands.

It is compatible to the previous "--checks" option, which will still work for some time. We have introduced the "--detect-sections" and "--plugins" options to make the two aspects of the "--checks" option configurable individually.

Setting this option to a comma separated list of plugin names will have the effect that the specified
command (that is, checking, inventory or discovery) will only be done for the provided plugins,
in the same way "--plugins" would.

In addition, Checkmk makes a best effort guess which sections should be fetched, that is:
It sets the "--detect-sections" option to all sections that may be needed for the provided plugins.
