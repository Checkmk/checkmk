Title: 'local' plugin crashed upon missing data on cluster

This change affects users who write local checks. The 'local' plugin crashed
when configured on a cluster and no nodes sent data for a service. This has
been fixed, and the service now shows the generic "Item not found in monitoring
data" message in that case. If your check does not use the 'P' option, but you
want the graphs to show WARN and CRIT information, then you need to change the
'P' option on.
