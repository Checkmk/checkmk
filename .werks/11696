The filestats check has the option to enable additional rules for certain files
within a file group. A new parameter has been added that gives the user the
option to add a user-friendly name that is displayed in the service details,
along with the matching pattern that is used to identify the files to which the
additional rules should be applied.

This is an incompatible change. If users have the additional rules
functionality enabled, they should open the corresponding ruleset and adjust
the parameter values.

If the additional rules functionality is not enabled, no action is required.
