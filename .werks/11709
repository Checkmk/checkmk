We introduce a new SNMP Backend now called Inline SNMP Backend.
If you are using the Enterprise Edition it is active by default.

This new Backend supersedes the old Inline SNMP Backend which used the
NetSNMP Python Bindings, now we use the PySNMP library.

Note: The old Inline SNMP Backend is still available and can be selected
via "Inline (legacy)" but please inform us if you have issues with the new
Backend so we can resolve them. The Legacy Inline SNMP Backend will be
removed sooner or later.
