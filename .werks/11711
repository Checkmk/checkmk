If the mk_logwatch agent plugin was used no Agent Output was created and
the HW-/SW Inventory would fail aswell. Therefore the agent plugin could
not be used for Windows.

The reasons for that were:

</li> In Python 3 sys.stdout returns \r\n as linebreak for Windows.
Checkmk can't handle this therefore we removed it by replacing
the default sys.stdout.
</li> The win32api module could not be imported because pywin32 was not installed.
Now pywin32 is installed by default.
