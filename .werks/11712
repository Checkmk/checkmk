If the mk_jolokia agent plugin was used the HW-/SW Inventory would
fail. Therefore the agent plugin could not be used for Windows.

The reason for that was that in Python 3 sys.stdout returns "\r\n"
as linebreak for Windows. Checkmk can't handle this therefore we
removed it by replacing the default sys.stdout.
