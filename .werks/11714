Openlog did not display the logfile with the Error:<br>
<b>Logfile does not exist</b><br>

<li> Logwatch did not retrieve information from path <b>var/check_mk/logwatch/HOST</b> rather from
<b>var/check_mk/logwatch/</b>.
<li> Logwatch Livestatus request did not support retrieving information from the basepath subfolder.
Now this possible by adding <b>subfolder/filename</b> to your livestatus query.
<li> The log data retrieved via Livestatus was not decoded properly.
Thats why no data was found for this logfile.
