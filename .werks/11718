This werk introduces a new service "Battery state", that monitors the following
battery conditions for Eaton UPS devices:
<ul>
<li>"Battery fault"</li>
<li>"Battery to be replaced"</li>
<li>"Low battery"</li>
<li>"Battery is not charging"</li>
<li>"Battery is at low condition"</li>
<li>"UPS is on battery"</li>
<li>"UPS is on bypass"</li>
<li>"UPS is on battery backup time"</li>
<li>"Overload"</li>
</ul>

It will yield a Critical state if one of the conditions changes to active.

This service is also discoverable on other UPS devices that support the generic
UPS MIB, but it will only monitor the "UPS is on battery" state.
