The Linux RPM packages built by the agent bakery are packaged independently
of any Linux distribution. Hence, the <tt>DISTRIBUTION</tt> and <tt>DISTTAG</tt>
tags are left empty within the underlying RPM spec file.

If you happen to need these tags, (e.g., if you employ some sort of additional
deployment mechanism, that reads from these tags) you can now specify
them with the help of the agent rule "Specify RPM package tags (Linux)".
