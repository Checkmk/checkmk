This is a regression since Checkmk 1.6.0p19 / Werk #11542.

When entering an SQL query/statement containing non-ASCII characters within the
"Check SQL Database" rule, this will result in a crash, showing the error
<tt>UnicodeEncodeError ('ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xf6'
in position 15: ordinal not in range(128))</tt>.

This is fixed now.
