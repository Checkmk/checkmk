After an (automatic) windows agent update took place,
the agent updater checks for a correct agent hash on the next call.

Previously, the check failed, if the new hash only contains numbers, with
the acutal update being successful.
As a result, the agent updater downloaded the agent periodically, while the
Check_MK Agent service periodically changed to WARN with a last_error of
<i>inconsistent pending update</i>.

With this Werk applied, the behavior will be fixed after the next agent baking
and the succeeding agent update on the affected hosts.
