This werk fixes a bug in the transformation of the discovery
parameters for network interfaces and switch ports. This bug
only affected users who updated from Checkmk 1.6 to Checkmk
2.0. For certain parameter configurations, it resulted in the
discovery of different interfaces after the update. The reason
for this was that the parameter transformation did not properly
take into account the hard-coded default discovery conditions
from Checkmk 1.6, which were always applied, unless the user
specifically configured different settings.
