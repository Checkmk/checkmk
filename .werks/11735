The check plugin <tt>arc_raid_status</tt>, which monitors Areca Raid Controllers,
reported the monitoring state CRIT when the raid was in the state "Checking".
However, this state means that a consistency check is currently performed on the
raid and does not indicate any issues. Therefore, with this werk, the monitoring
state of raids with the status "Checking" will be OK.
