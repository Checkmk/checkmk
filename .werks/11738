We have added a new functionality to the mk_filestats agent plugin: it is now
possible to group files within a file group further into subgroups. Subgroups
can be formed using a regular expression pattern. It is possible to configure
this functionality via the agent bakery ruleset, "Count, size and age of files
- mk_filestat".
If you would like to use this feature, the mk_filestats agent must be
redeployed to the relevant hosts.
