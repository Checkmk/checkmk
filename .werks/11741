The fileinfo.groups check has the option to persist a service in the
monitoring overview even when there are no files found for the file group. This
is done by configuring an enforced service for this check, which always
returned an UNKNOWN status with the following error message:

"No group pattern found in autocheck. Temporarily disable this service to get
this fixed."

However, the problem could not be fixed with this action. This has now been
resolved with a different approach, requiring no further action from the user.
