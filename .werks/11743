Class: fix

Log files with special characters (e.g. Ã¤) are ignored by the mk_logwatch
plugin in the event that the locale of the host is set to POSIX. On certain
operating systems (SLES 12), crashes have been observed due to the same issue.
They present with the following error message:

UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe4 in position 2: ordinal
not in range(128).

This is due to a missing character encoding and has been fixed. The plugin
needs to be redistributed if this fix is needed.
