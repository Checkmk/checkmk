Hosts are matched to events in the Event Console using different specification
methods: hostname, IP address, and host alias. In the event that multiple
specification methods are used to query events, livestatus queries did not
return events for hosts if the letter casing was inconsistent. This was caused
by two mechanisms:

- Preliminary filters that determine whether livestatus queries need to be
  performed
- Host matching criteria that returned negative results

This defect becomes evident when the check_mkevents Active Check is used to
monitor events, and multiple items in the "Match the hosts with" option are
selected ("Check event state in Event Console" ruleset). In this case, the
check will return fewer events than are expected.

The livestatus query now supports case-insensitive host/event matching. Please
be advised that this fix may result in larger volumes of matched events.
