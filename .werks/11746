The mssql_counters.file_sizes check allows the user to configure upper
warn/crit levels for database log files in percent: "MSSQL Log and Data File
Sizes" ruleset, option "Used log files: Absolute or relative upper levels":
"Upper percentage levels".
The graph of this check presents all performance data in actual size (bytes).
If the above option is enabled, however, the warn/crit levels were reported in
percent, resulting in inconsistent scales shown in the graphs.
This has been fixed, so that warn/crit levels are always reported in bytes, and
the scaling is consistent.
