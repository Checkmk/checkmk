SNMP Management boards were previously contacted with different SNMP settings.
SNMP management boards on non-SNMP hosts always used SNMPv1 (no bulk walk)
while SNMP management boards of hosts that are also monitored with SNMP,
inherited the bulk walk option from the host.

With Checkmk 2.0 it is now possible to explicitly configure this setting using
the ruleset "Management board SNMP using bulk walk (enforces SNMP v2c)".

Sites created with Checkmk 2.0 or newer will automatically use SNMPv2 and bulk
walks for all SNMP management boards. For compatibility reasons the behaviour
of existing sites is kept as initially described. However, in case your devices
support SNMPv2 and bulk walks, it is highly recommended to use it, for performance
reasons. In case you want to change to SNMPv2, you can create a rule without
condition in the ruleset "Management board SNMP using bulk walk (enforces SNMP
v2c)" to switch the default to SNMPv2 and bulk walks.
