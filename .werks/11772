The in Checkmk versions 2.0.0i1 and 2.0.0b1 the TCP/SNMP information had been
dropped from the output of <tt>cmk --list-checks</tt>.

This was due to the fact that check plugins are now neither purely one or the other.
We now write "agent" if the check plugin requires an agent data source (e.g. the
 regular Checkmk linux agent), "snmp" if it reguires an SNMP data source,
and "agent/snmp" if it can be discovered with either of the data source types.
