The docker_container_mem section plugin crashed upon output from a container that was running,
but did not provide any memory statistics. This may happen if the memory cgroup is not enabled
in the kernel.
Such containers will be discovered, but the service will always be {UNKNOWN}.
If your setup deliberately includes such hosts, you can ignore the service using the
"Disabled services" ruleset.
