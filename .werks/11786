proxmox_ve_disk_usage summary and metrics have been very sparse, not including
FS size or percentage of usage.
This changes makes the check output look like other df based checks including
{{fs_used}}, {{fs_size}} and {{fs_used_percent}} metrics, as well as a summary
in form of {{50.00% used (1.10 TB of 2.20 TB)}}.
