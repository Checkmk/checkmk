This werk affects all users who use the mail (not asciimail)
plugin. If your emails contain performance graphs only the
first 5 graphs will be sent by default. Additionally, if you
use notification bulking only graphs for the first 5
notifications in a bulk will be sent.

You can adjust these settings with the options "Graphs per
notification" and "Bulk notifications with graphs" either
directly in the notification rule or with the ruleset
"Parameters for HTML Email".

Reason behind this werk:
Each graph in a bulk increases the size of the mail and takes
time to render on the monitoring server. For very large bulks
the mail size may exceed the maximum size for attachements or
the plugin may run into a timeout so that a failed notification
is produced. This werk will therefore increase the liability
and performance of HTML emails.
Since most services have fewer than five graphs and the most
important information is displayed in the first graphs a total
number of 5 graphs should be sufficient even in single
notifications. Furthermore, for a detailed analysis the data
displayed in emails is usually not sufficient and a look into
the user interface is necessary.
