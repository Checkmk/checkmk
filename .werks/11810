On standard site installations, locks during mkbackup are now site specific.
This results in multiple sites being able to be backed-up simultaneously.
On appliances, a system-wide backup will still lock all sites regarding backup.

<b>Version Limitations for Appliances:</b>
With this werk, the minimal required appliance version will be <tt>1.4.16</tt>.

<b>Technical Details:</b>
Werk 11868 tried to fix permission issues during mkbackup of different
sites.
However directories under <tt>/var/lock/</tt> are volatile and
therefore the creation and the setting of the rights on the <tt>mkbackup</tt> folder must be performed on every system (omd) restart.
Therefore <tt>omd</tt> will now try to ensure that this folder exists
and has the correct permissions.

Furthermore, the backup directory has been moved to
<tt>/run/lock/mkbackup</tt> as this is the standard path for locks
according to FHS.
