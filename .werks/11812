ESX vsphere may return multipath devices without LUN ID (e.g. "local marvel processor").
This led to mixed-up service items for esx_vsphere_hostsystem.multipath as the parsing continued without an Exception.
As a user you may notice this, when you see a path as service item (instead of a LUN).

Devices without a LUN ID are now skipped and the parsing is fixed.

As the discovery may discovered false items, you may need to perform a
rediscovery in case you're affetcted by this issue.
