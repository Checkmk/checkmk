The async sections of mk_oracle.ps1 (Windows Version of mk_oracle) had a major design flaw.
The async sections may not be fully executed and led to stale services.
This is fixed now.

Keep in mind that you need to set the execution mode for this plugin to async in check_mk.user.yaml:
execution:
    - pattern: '$CUSTOM_PLUGINS_PATH$\mk_oracle.ps1'
      async: yes

With Werk #11815 <tt>async: yes</tt> be done automatically via the extended mk_oracle bakery plugin.
