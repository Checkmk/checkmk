This werk extends the quicksearch by the following two commands:
<ul>
<li><tt>hl</tt>: search for hosts using host labels.</li>
<li><tt>sl</tt>: search for services using service labels.</li>
</ul>
In both cases, labels have to entered in the format <tt>[KEY]:[VALUE]</tt>,
for example <tt>os:windows</tt>. These two new commands can also be
combined with each other and with already existing commands.
