The check plugin <tt>esx_vsphere_counters_diskio</tt>, which
monitors the IO throughput of ESX host systems, displayed far
too low values for the rates of IO operations. This has been
fixed by using the metrics <tt>disk.numberReadAveraged</tt> and
<tt>disk.numberWriteAveraged</tt> instead of <tt>disk.numberRead</tt>
and <tt>disk.numberWrite</tt>.
