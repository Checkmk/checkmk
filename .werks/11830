The check plugin <tt>timesyncd</tt> monitors the synchronization of linux hosts
with time servers. One of the monitored quantities is the time passed since the
last synchronization with the time server. Up to now, the corresponding default
thresholds were set to 1h (WARN) and 2h (CRIT). However, practice has shown that
1:30h (WARN) and 2h (CRIT) are more suitable, therefore, with this werk, we
change the defaults to these values. Note that this does not affect any user-
defined levels (ruleset "Systemd Timesyncd time synchronisation", option
"Allowed duration since last synchronisation").
