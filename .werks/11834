This werk introduces the new check plugin <tt>cmk_site_statistics</tt>.
This plugin monitors the number of hosts and services of Checkmk sites.
It reports the total number of hosts, the number of hosts which are not
UP as well as metrics recording the number of hosts which are UP, DOWN,
in downtime and unreachable. Similarly, for services, the plugin reports
the total number of services, the number of services which are not OK
and metrics recording the number of services which are OK, in downtime,
on down hosts, WARNING, UNKNOWN and CRITICAL.

This check plugin creates one service per Checkmk site. These services
will be discovered on hosts with one ore more sites which have the
Checkmk Linux agent installed. The monitoring state of these services is
always OK and they are not configurable.
