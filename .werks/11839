In some rare cases, Windows agent updater process may hang.

Previously, Windows agent has ignored this situation - OS might be overloaded 
with many running cmk-agent-updater processess.

With this release, Windows agent terminates (on timeout) previousy started 
updater process and thus fixes the problem.
