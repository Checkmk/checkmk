Previously, on older Windows OS Windows agent may use invalid PID to kill 
process tree of the hanging Windows agent's updater thus crashing Windows.

Since this release, terminating of the hanging <tt>cmk-update-agent.exe</tt> 
is based not only on PID, but also on name thus eliminating possibility of 
the crash.
