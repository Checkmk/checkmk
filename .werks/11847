Since this release it is possible to generate winperf data without spawning a 
new process.

To enable this feature  you should edit check_mk.user.yml file and set in the 
section <tt>winperf</tt> the key <tt>fork</tt> in <tt>no</tt>

This setting is primary intended for problem solving and should be used carefully, 
because Windows OS may leak handles when winperf API is used.
