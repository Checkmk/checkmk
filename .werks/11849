Since this release it's possible to choose the legacy Python environment, i.e. Python 3.4, thus
enabling full support for obsolete(EOL) Windows OS's. For example, Windows Server 2008, Windows
Server 2008R2, Windows Vista and Windows 7 require legacy Python environment.

To enable Python support for obsolete Windows OS's you should choose in the Bakery the ruleset
<tt>Install Python runtime environment</tt> and set value of the drop list <tt>Python environment</tt>
to the <tt>Deploy legacy environment(Python 3.4 + standard sets of modules)</tt>.

Despite the legacy python environment is fully compatible with any current Windows OS's, for
security and performance reasons it is highly recommended, if possible, to use only standard python
environment.
