Previously, it was possible to configure the Windows agent in WATO in such 
a way that installing on older operating systems would cause the Windows 
agent updater to fail( or make such plugins as mk_jolokia or mk_logwatch more 
inoperable). For example: setting of the <tt>Standard python environment(3.8+ )</tt> 
and deploy such MSI on Windows 2008. This could cause complete falling out of the 
host of the monitoring, because the installed standard Python, 3.8+, can't work 
on Windows 2008.

With this release the problem has been solved. If during deployment configuration 
is not supported by Windows OS, the installation will not be performed: the 
MSI will always check Windows version and stops own installation if, Windows OS 
doesn't match to MSI requirements. The host will continue to operates normally in 
any case. 

Nevertheless, you need to fix the configuration in WATO in the order to make 
the update for older Windows system. In the case of the aforementioned example, 
you have to select <tt>Deploy legacy environment (Python 3.4 + standard set of modules)</tt> 
in the rule <tt>Install Python runtime environment</tt>, activate changes and bake 
the agent.
