Previously, the protection algorithm was hard-coded into the Windows agent and 
it was called synchronously. Such approach may lead to some rare but important 
problems, because the start of the Windows agent service required a lot of 
time and Windows service manager may not accept this delay.

Since this release Windows agent uses batch script, which runs in a separate 
and independent process. This script provides the identical functionality as 
before, but it doesn't interfere with Windows agent service thus solving the 
problem with delay.
