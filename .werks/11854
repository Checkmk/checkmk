Previously, in some rare cases such running processes could create quite 
serious problems for the agent. They may  prevent or damage agent installation 
due to the locking of file.

Since this release the problem is resolved. All processes, which have binaries 
located in <tt>%programdata%/checkmk/agent</tt>, will be unconditionally 
terminated on service exit.
