Previously, cleaning routine of the Windows agent was called too late: after the sending of the signal "SERVICE_STOPPED". 
This may lead to the disappearing of some directories in <tt>%programdata%/checkmk/agent</tt>, because deleting of 
directories, such as <tt>tmp</tt>, is the integral part of the cleaning phase of the update routine. If the cleaning 
will happen after the Windows agent restarted, then the cleaning will remove working directories and the Windows agent 
will not be able to function properly.
 
With this release the error had been fixed.
