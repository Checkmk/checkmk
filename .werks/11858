With the option "Expect regular messages" you can make the Event Console
monitor that a certain number of messages are <b>at least</b> seen within each
regular time interval. Otherwise an event will be created.

If there already exists an open event because of absent messages according to
this rule, you can optionally merge the new incident with the existing event.
You can choose to not only merge events in "open" state, but also in
"acknowledged" state.

Previously the Event console always reset the state back to "open", even even
in case an "acknowledged" event is being merged. This behavior is based on the
assumption that you want to be informed when there is new information. However,
there are also use cases where new incoming messages should be counted to the
already existing event in the "acknowledged" state and the "acknowledged" state
should be kept. To achieve this, the new configuration option "Reset
acknowledged state" can now be disabled.

Existing rules will work as before. New created rules will automatically untick
the checkbox "Reset acknowledged state" to keep the acknowledged state by
default.
