The site and appliance backup functionality of Checkmk share a global
lock which ensures that only a single backup or restore job is running
at a time.

However, on current linux distributions, a permission issue may occur when
backing up multiple sites on a single Checkmk server. The problem appears when
one site creates the global lock file (<tt>/tmp/mkbackup.lock</tt>), locks it and
releases the lock after the backup. The file is kept after that. Once another
site tries to lock the file during it's backup, a "Permission denied" error is
raised. This is caused by specific file restrictions in directories where the
sticky bit is set.

The lock file has now been moved to <tt>/var/lock/mkbackup/mkbackup.lock</tt>
to solve this issue.
