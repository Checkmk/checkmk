Version: 2.1.0b1

The 2.0.0b4 release introduced a regression in the Linux agent which broke the
execution of cached agent plugins (which also includes the agent updater for
example). The plugins that are placed below
<tt>/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/[seconds]</tt> were not executed at all in
2.0.0b4.

Possible workarounds:

<ul>
<li>Move the plugin to the <tt>/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins</tt> directory
    to execute it every check cycle</li>
<li>Use an agent of previous 2.0.0 releases</li>
<li>Use the agent from a daily build 2021-01-16 or newer</li>
</ul>
