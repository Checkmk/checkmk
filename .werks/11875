The agent output may randomly contain errors like this in the first line of the
agent output "line 12: echo: write error: Broken pipe" which would confuse the
Checkmk server side and result in Check_MK services reporting CRITICAL states
with an error message like "Unsupported protocol version" or "Agent output is
encrypted but encryption is disabled by configuration".
