In sites that have been upgraded from pre 2.0 versions to 2.0.0i1 or 2.0.0b1 the SNMP data source for host could fail if the host had some SNMP walks cached.

This is a consequence of our migration from python2 to python3.
This problem can also be fixed manually by removing the <tt>var/check_mk/snmp_cache/</tt> folder.
