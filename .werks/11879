This werk only affects users who have configured the NTP service discovery manually via mk
file.
The discovery of the "NTP Peer <item>" and "NTP Time" service has been configurable only via
the config variable <tt>ntp_inventory_mode</tt>. This variable is no longer valid.
To configure the service discovery please use in the new discovery rule "NTP Discovery".
If you do not configure a WATO rule, the plugin will fall back to its default behaviour,
which is to discover a summary service.
