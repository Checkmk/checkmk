In versions 1.6.0p12 to 1.6.0p19 the 'capacity' metric was not produced if the
correspinding devices were on main power supply. If it was produced, it was
the canonical unit sections, which is desirable, but an incompatible change in
Checkmk 1.6.

Note that some devices report "0 minutes left" in case they are on mains.
In this case no levels are applied, to avoid false positives.
