The rulesets <i>"Agent sections to be executed"</i> and <i>"Disabled agent sections"</i>
have been renamed to <i>"Enabled sections (Windows agent)"</i> and
<i>"Disabled sections (Windows agent)"</i>, respectively.
This makes the naming scheme more consistent, both inherently and in relation
to other section disabling rulesets (Linux agent and SNMP).
