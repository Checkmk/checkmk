If the option "Create separate notification bulks..." in section "Notification
Bulking" of notification rules was used for service notifications, the bulk
mechanism always pointed to the service context to find the host custom
attributes.

The host custom attributes are now also available for the above scenario.

Please check your notification rules to avoid unwanted bulking because of
previously non functional configuration.
