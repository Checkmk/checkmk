Title: fileinfo: SAP HANA files shown as WARN if jointly monitored with other files

Class: fix

SAP HANA file monitoring returns a WARN status with the error message "File
stat time failed" if the fileinfo check is configured to also monitor other
files on the same host. This has been fixed, so that SAP HANA file monitoring
can be used concurrently with other file monitoring.
