The Check_MK and Check_MK Discovery services crashed in association with the
mssql_jobs check with the following error message:

ValueError (time data ' 000000' does not match format '%Y%m%d %H%M%S')

This crash occurs when the next run date and next run time of the MSSQL jobs
are not set (i.e. set to NULL).
This has been fixed.
