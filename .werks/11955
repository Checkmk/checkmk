The ruleset "Kubernetes" that is used to set up the Kubernetes special agent
can be found in Setup > Agents > VM, Cloud, Container. This ruleset now has
additional options for configuring the API server endpoint. It is possible to
configure a custom URL to connect to. Alternatively, the DNS hostname or IP
address can be used automatically for each host, in combination with optional
parameters for port (default is 443) and path prefix. Please read the help
text of these options for more information.
