Checkmk no longer ships '*.include' files in the 'checks/' directory
(see <a href="https://checkmk.com/de/werk/11118">Werk #11118</a>).
In case you have MKPs installed that need them (but do not include
them themselves) you must either update your MKP or provide the
required files in the 'local' folder hierarchy.

The error message now reports the correct path where to put the file.
