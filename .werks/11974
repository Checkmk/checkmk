Unfortunately Python 2 allowed to enter invalid regexes into the service condition of check parameter rules.
In Python 3 these values will lead to a crash when evaluating the service condition.
E.g. a service condition like "C:\Users\" leads to the error message "re.error: incomplete escape \U at position 2".

Therefore the Checkmk update procedure (cmk-update-config) validates the regular expressions in service conditions of
check parameter rules and logs "ERROR: Invalid regular expression in service condition detected" if the regex cannot
be evaluated at all or logs "WARN: Service condition in rule looks like a windows path that is not correctly escaped."
if the regex seems to be a windows path that contains a single backslash instead of two backslashes.
If you encounter these errors or warnings your configuration probably contains rules that needs to be corrected.
Previous Checkmk versions were not complaining about those rules but they were not able to match.
You should change these rules according to https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/regexes.html prior to the update
of your production site.
E.g. you should change windows paths like "C:\Users\" to "C:\\Users\\" with double backslashes.
