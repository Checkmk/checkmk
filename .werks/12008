In the rule "Periodic service discovery" users have been able to configure either
"Perform full SNMP scan always, detect new check types" or
"Just rely on existing check files, detect new items only".

This was solving performance issues since the automatic service discovery was not
using cached data.

Since this has been fixed, this option is no longer required. User will now always
detect new check types.
