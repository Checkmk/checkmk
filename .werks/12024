This werk introduces the two new check plugins <tt>fortigate_antivirus</tt>
and <tt>fortigate_ips</tt>. They monitor the detection and blocking rate of
FortiGate AntiVirus and IPS systems. One service is created per virtual
domain. These services go {WARN} or {CRIT} if the detection rate exceeds
user-configurable levels.
