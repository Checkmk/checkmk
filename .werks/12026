The graph displayed by a performance graph dashlet is now specified
by selecting from a list of available graphs, represented by their
titles. This list can optionally be pre-filtered by host name or service
description. Before this werk, graphs in performance graph dashlets were
specified by a number indexing the graphs produced by the corresponding
service (n'th graph).

Performance graph dashlets created before this werk will continue to
work. However, upon editing them the next time, you will have to re-
select the graph to be displayed.
