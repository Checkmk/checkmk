Checkmk creates NagVis backends for all sites. For each site it creates two backends:

<ul>
<li>[site_id] - Livestatus connection to the sites core</li>
<li>[site_id]_bi - Bacned to Checkmk BI for displaying aggregation states</li>
</ul>

In case one tries to add a site with a Site-ID <tt>[central_site]_bi</tt> this
will result in a name conflict between the central site BI backend and the
remote site livestatus backend.

The distributed monitoring configuration prevents adding new remote sites with this
name from now on.
