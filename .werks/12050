A lot of interface checks did exactly the same thing. The new check API allows us to
consolidate them into one check plugin {{interfaces}}, without affecting the user.

The following check plugins will be replaced by the new one:
{{statgrab_net}}, {{emc_vplex_if}}, {{vms_if}}, {{if_brocade}}, {{if_lancom}},
{{ucs_bladecenter_if}}, {{aix_if}}, {{if}}, {{if_fortigate}}, {{hp_msa_if}}, {{if64_tplink}}.

The transition to the new services is done during `cmk-update-config`.
Existing rules will apply as before, no metrics will be lost.

It may slightly change the "Service check command" count of the {{site_objects_counts}}
plugin, depending on its configuration.
