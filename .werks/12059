New visuals like e.g. dashboards where created with default option "Show more",
so in show_mode "Show less" this visuals could not be found in the "Monitor"
menu, unless you used the "show more" button.

This default option was removed on creation. Furthermore, we created a new topic
"My workplace" where you can place your new visuals in the mentioned menu.
This topic is only visible after adding the first visual.
