If you imported a timeperiod via the option "Import iCalendar" with version 1.6
upwards, a default active time range was set.
This could leed to unwanted send notifications. Timeperiods imported with
version 1.5 are not affected.

From now on there will be no default. Please check your imported timeperiods.
