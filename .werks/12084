Some command line arguments for the check_mail active check had been assembled in a way that
allowed invalid values for {{forward_app}} or {{match_subject}}.
Activating "Forward mails as events to Event Console" in WATO without specifying forward app or
a regex for subject would provide the sting "None" to forward-app and leave {{match_subject}}
empty resulting in an Unhandled exception: 

TypeError('first argument must be string or compiled pattern')

This change fixes command line argument generation and checks for {{match_subject}} being set.
