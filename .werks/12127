Since #11499 we are tracking login sessions in each site individually.
This results in one change of the authentication session handling that
has not been mentioned in the previous werk before.

In previous Checkmk versions it was possible to share login session between
Checkmk sites of a single distributed setup. You could login into the central
site and then browse to the user interface of the remote site and did not have
to login into that site because your central site login session was accepted.
This is not possible anymore.

The result is: The login sessions of Checkmk sites are now completely
independent of other sites.
