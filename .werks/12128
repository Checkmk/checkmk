When using encrypted livestatus connections for accessing remote sites while
not using the livestatus proxy daemon, this could result in errors like
"attempt to connect already-connected SSLsocket" or some handshake related
errors like "The handshake operation timed out".

This was caused by the livestatus.py client which tries to optimize the connect
timeouts by first starting with a very small timeout and then retrying with a
larger timeout value. This worked as expected for not encrypted connections,
but not for encrypted connections which were able to perform the connect but
not the TLS handshake in time. The second try was then failing because of the
already connected socket from the first try. This already connected socket is
now handled correctly and will retry the handshake with a longer timeout.
