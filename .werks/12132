Previous 2.0 versions produced crash reports (KeyErrors) when a column was
linking to another view while a mandatory context information was missing in
the source row. This could e.g. happen when trying to link to a "single
hostgroup" view from a view showing host rows (where no single host group is
availabile).

Instead of showing the crash the GUI is now linking to the target view. Once
a user opens up the view, the view is showing a warning message and asks for
the missing context information.
