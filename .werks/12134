When a dcd connection was configured to operate in the central site of
a distributed setup, the connection could fail with only executing
the phase 1 of the synchronization. This was caused by a file
<tt>etc/check_mk/dcd.d/wato/distributed.mk</tt> in the central site
telling the DCD that it was a remote site.
