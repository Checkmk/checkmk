With Checkmk 2.0 the audit logging of the setup has been extended to be more
detailed. We added the general capability of tracking changes to configuration
objects on attribute level.

The audit log can be opened going to "Setup > General > Audit log". On that
page you have the list of recorded changes with the new "Details" column. You
also have the general filter form that can be used for filtering the changes
you are interested in.

You can also find context related links from hosts, users and rules to the audit
log entries that are specific to this object.

You may notice that the "Details" column is empty for a lot of changes.

This is because we need to turn on the recording of details specific to each
action. In Checkmk, we have implemented this for the most common actions first.
These are:

<ul>
<li>Create, edit and delete hosts</li>
<li>Create, edit and delete folders</li>
<li>Service discovery (bulk and single host discovery)</li>
<li>Create, edit and delete users</li>
<li>Create, edit, move and delete rules</li>
</ul>

Over time, we will increase the level of detail of the other existing log messages.
