When a dashboard has multiple graph dashlets showing different time ranges, it
may be not intended to synchronize the time ranges by zooming into a single
graph. By default Checkmk synchronizes the time ranges and pins of all graphs
on a page.

This can now be disabled for each graph dashlet individually by setting the
graph rendering option "Do not follow timerange changes of other graphs on the
current page".
