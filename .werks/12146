The form for the configuration "Activate update only on the selected hosts",
that can be found at the "Automatic agent updates" page, undergoes two improvements:

Test hostname without activation:<br>
It is now possible to test a hostname for being considered for automatic updates,
without the need to activate the new conditions. To achieve this, enter the new conditions
at the "Conditions" section, enter the hostname to be tested at the "Test hostname before
activation" section and hit "Test". The result will be displayed inline.

Better visibility of activation button:<br>
The activation button for new filled-in conditions is moved into the "Activate update
only in the selected hosts" form (it was placed undearneath before), is renamed to
"Apply conditions" (It was named "Change selection" before) and is displayed with
a green background for better visibility.
