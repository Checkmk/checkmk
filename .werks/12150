When configuring the entry "Proxy settings" and choosing the item "Provide
proxy settings" at the "Agent updater" agent ruleset, the agent bakery
would fail to bake agents, showing a traceback with the error:<br>
<tt>Error creating agent for ... : Error in bakery plugin
"cmk_update_agent" ("files" section): 'proxy'</tt>

This is fixed now.
