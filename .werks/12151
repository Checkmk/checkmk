In some rare cases, the agent updater may fail on hosts that have a proxy environment
configured. I.e., one of the environment variables <tt>HTTP_PROXY</tt>, <tt>HTTPS_PROXY</tt>,
<tt>ALL_PROXY</tt> (also lowercase variants) are set.

The agent updater will eventually fail with the following error message, which will be visible
at the <tt>cmk-update-agent.log</tt>:<br>
<tt>RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration</tt>

This Werk is marked as incompatible, because there may be some manual action needed to
overcome this error:
If you are experiencing this error, you can temporarily unset the above mentioned environment
variable(s) on the affected systems in order to allow the agent updater to run properly and
to update itself to the fixed version. Alternatively, you can install a newly baked agent
on the system.
