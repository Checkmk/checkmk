Title: mk_jolokia: Error running agent plugin when deploying via agent bakery

When deploying the agent plugin <tt>mk_jolokia</tt> via agent bakery, the
execution of the plugin will fail, if the field "Name of the instance in the
monitoring" is set within the "JMX monitoring of Java JVMs using Jolokia".

As the corresponding agent section is missing when experiencing this error,
the corresponding services will change it's state to <tt>UNKNOWN</tt>. When
running the mk_jolokia plugin manually, this will result in a traceback, ending
with the error<br>
<tt>TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'</tt>

This is fixed with this Werk. The plugin and the corresponding services will be
functional again when rebaking and deploying agents.
