When deploying files to agent packages using the agent bakery and the
"Deploy custom files with agent" ruleset, the agent bakery would fail
to bake agents, if there are any files placed under your custom files
package's <tt>bin</tt> subdirectory that have an executable flag set.

This is fixed now.
