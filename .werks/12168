Title: Handle non-persistent comments correctly

You can add non-persistent host/service comments via Livestatus, and these
should vanish when the monitoring core is restarted.  The CMC effectively
ignored the "persistent" flag for these user comments, so even
non-persistent comments survived a restart.  This has been fixed, the CMC
now behaves like Nagios.

Note that this fix doesn't affect comments added via the GUI, because these
are always persistent.
