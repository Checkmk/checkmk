The check plugin {{statgrab_disk}} is merged into the check
plugin {{diskstat}}.
The same rulesets apply, the metrics are kept.

Already discovered services are 'moved' during `cmk-update-config`.

This may slightly change the "Service check command" count
of the {{site_objects_counts}} plugin, depending on its
configuration.
