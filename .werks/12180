Previously services which were discovered by check plugins
that are not available anymore have been filtered, and
where (almost) never seen.
They were reported as 'vanished' by the Checkmk Discovery check,
but did *not* show on the discovery page, nor in the services
page.

They are now treated as regular services, with the service
description "Unimplemented check &lt;name&gt;".
They will always be in {{UNKNOWN}} state.

This situation can occur for instance if you uninstall an MKP, or
modify a plugin locally and make a mistake.

If you suddenly encounter such services after an upgrade to Checkmk 2.0,
it means that you had such services in your configuration all along.
You can remove them from your configuration just as any other service.
