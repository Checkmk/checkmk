Local checks will now automatically show their metrics in the service output.
This means you can simplify your local checks from outputting e.g.

<tt>P Warehouse number_of_things=23;17;42 Number of things: 23.00</tt>

to the shorter

<tt>P Warehouse number_of_things=23;17;42</tt>

Note that the levels will only be shown in the service graphs, if 'P'
is used for the state -- that is, if Checkmk can be sure that they
actually affect the state of the service.
