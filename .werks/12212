Previously, there were misunderstandings about setting downtimes in service
views. Without the option "Schedule downtimes on the affected hosts instead of on the
individual services" the downtime was "only" set for the services of that view,
not the host itself.

To make this clearer, the user can now choose between "Schedule downtime on
host" and "Schedule downtime for services" in the confirm dialog for downtimes
in such views. The above mentioned option for "...hosts instead of on the
individual services" was removed.
