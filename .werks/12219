Title: Fix GIT version control for WATO
Class: fix

Version: 2.1.0b1

If the local site needs no restart, no activation of changes is needed. But in
earlier versions, the activation also triggered the commit command for done
changes, so commits were no longer done.

Commits are now done independent of activating changes.
