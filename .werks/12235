The Linux agent plugin for monitoring DB2 instances (<tt>mk_db2</tt>) had a
permissions issue when being deployed via the agent bakery. The plugin tried
to call itself as a DB2 instance user, however, the directory where the plugin
is located requires root permissions.

For this fix to come into effect, users have to re-bake and update the Linux
agent for all affected systems.
