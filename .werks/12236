The check plugin <tt>oracle_instance</tt>, which monitors the state of
Oracle instances, now displayes more detailed version information if the
corresponding Oracle version supports this (the minimum required version
for this is Oracle 18c).

The displayed version will for example change from Version 19.0.0.0.0 to
Version 19.5.0.0.0. This has no impact on the monitoring state of the
corresponding services.
