The agent plugin <tt>mk_cups_queues</tt>, which delivers data about printers
in queues within the CUPS printing system, now accepts printer names which
contain hyphens ("-"). As a result, the corresponding check plugin <tt>cups_queues</tt>
will now receive data about such printers and discover them.

Note that you have to update the Checkmk agent on the corresponding hosts for
this werk to become effective.
