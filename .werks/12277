The Checkmk docker container image was previously based on the
debian:stretch-slim image. The base image has now been updated to
debian:buster-slim.

If you build the container images on your own, based on the Dockerfile from our
git, you will now have to use the Checkmk packages for Debian buster instead of
the stretch packages.
