In 2.0.0p1 CRE, metrics belonging to different services would
be grouped incorrectly.  The fix published in 2.0.0p2 introduced
another bug in that it is missing the name mangling.  This
produced the following error for services containing spaces:

"No historic metrics recorded but performance data is available.
Maybe performance data processing is disabled."

This werk should fix both issues.
