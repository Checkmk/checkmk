<b>This fix is only necessary for Nagios.</b>

Clusters containing nodes with a special agent would crash with
the traceback

<tt>
  File "/omd/sites/core/lib/python3/cmk/base/checkers/programs.py", line 266, in _make_source_args
    info_func = config.special_agent_info[special_agent_id]
</tt>

because the special agent was missing from the configuration
of the cluster.
