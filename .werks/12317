Previously, automatic update of the Windows agent with Python module installed 
has lead to long delays in the monitoring - up to few minutes, because the 
installation of the Python module requires a lot of CPU time.

Since this release the problem is solved. Windows agent instead of the 
uninstalling of the Python module in it's uninstallation phase, moves the 
module to the temporary cache. If incoming installation of the Windows agent 
uses the same version og Python module, then Python module will be moved from 
cache to the ProgramData directory. If the versions are different, then old 
method will be used, i.e. full installation.

Because changing of the version of the Python module happens very rarely, the 
usual update of the Windows agent requires no more than few seconds.
