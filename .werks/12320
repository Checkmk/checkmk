It was discovered that using SNMP-v1 datasource with default(Inline) backend may 
lead to memory leak in fetcher processes.

Since this release a host configured with datasources SNMP-v1 will use Classic SNMP 
backend thus eliminating the problem.

To enable the fix you may need to update site configuration using WATO or command 
line.
