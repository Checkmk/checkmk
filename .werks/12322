In the past we delivered in the shipped package few Windows exe files, which were either intended to be 
installed on their own or should serve as an example. However some antivirus programs produced false positives 
for these files.

Because in this version the agent installation can only be carried out using the MSI and the example is no 
more relevant, all exe files have been removed from the shipped package thus fixing the problem with 
antivirus software.
