Previously, Windows agent supplied as working directory the current one.
This may lead to failure if the starting plugin in RunAs mode had being 
executed from the account without valid access rights. 

Since this release the problem has been eliminated. If a plugin is starting 
in RunAs mode, then Windows Agent supplies to the starting plugin user home 
directory as a working directory.
