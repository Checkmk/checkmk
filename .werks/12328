On heavy loaded systems the Windows WMI subsystem may not respond in 
time thus some WMI based services will be switched into the stale state.

Since this release, the user can leverage above mentioned problem by 
setting a higher value in wmi_timeout via the ruleset <i>"Windows WMI 
Timeout"</i>. Acceptable range is 2-12 seconds, default value is 3 seconds.
