Previously, the limit of 20MB for any file packed by the bakery in the 
installer could be enforced only during installation of the agent. This 
could cause a serious problem during mass updating of multiple monitored 
hosts: the agent installation process will fail on every host to be updated.

Since this release Bakery forbids adding too big files to the agent installer 
thus eliminating above mentioned problem with installation and update of the 
agent.
