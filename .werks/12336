Previously, when showing the information of a folder or listing
all folders, the hosts were not displayed due to performance reasons.

This can now be switched back on with an additional query parameter
named "show_hosts". When set to a non-zero value, the hosts are shown
in the response.

There is no further configuration neccessary.
