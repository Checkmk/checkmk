Some URLs of the agent bakery section had to be changed, to be in line
with the rest of the system. These URLs had to be changed:

/domain-types/agent/actions/sign
  became
/domain-types/agent/actions/sign/invoke

/domain-types/agent/actions/bake
  became
/domain-types/agent/actions/bake/invoke

/domain-types/agent/actions/bake_and_sign
  became
/domain-types/agent/actions/bake_and_sign/invoke

/domain-types/agent/actions/automatic-deployment
  became
/domain-types/agent/actions/automatic-deployment/invoke
