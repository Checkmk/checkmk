When configuring a Network Scan on a Folder, IP ranges can be defined
in the section "IP ranges to scan" and "IP ranges to exclude". Both
allowed for an exclusion of IPs through "List of patterns to exclude"
by using regex, yet only the pattern on "IP ranges to exclude" had
any effect.

This werk removes the "List of patterns to exclude" option from the
"IP ranges to scan" section of "Network Scan" on the Folder configuration
screen.

Any previously stored "IP ranges to exclude" on "IP ranges to scan" will
continue to be ignored, yet no longer displayed.

No new entries like that can be made after this werk.
