This werk introduces some changes to the update endpoint of host and folder.
Providing a non existing remove attribute resulted previously in a 500 error.
This is fixed to return a more appropriate 400 error. The bulk update code examples
were updated to reflect the actual content of the endpoint. Similar to the single
update call, the bulk update now also return a 400 error instead of 500 when
trying to remove non existing attributes.
