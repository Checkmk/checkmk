Due to a regression no check plugins could be disabled for management
interfaces from version 2.0.0i1 to 2.0.0.

Users were unable to edit existing rules if they included check plugins
starting with <tt>mgmt_</tt>, and to create new rules to disable check
plugins discovered on management boards (unless they were separate Checkmk hosts).

You can now disable check plugins for regular hosts and management boards
separately in the ruleset <i>"Disabled checks"</i>.

Previously configured rules will continue to work, and can be edited.
