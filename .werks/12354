During cmk-update-config we re-write the WATO rules.
In case the transformation of a value of an individual rule failed,
we did not write the transformed rulesets at all. This lead to
rules that could not be edited (the reported error was
<i>"You are trying to edit a rule which does not exist anymore."</i>).
This could be mitigated by temporarily adding a new rule; after that
you could edit the pre-existing rules.

With this werk, we write the transformed rulesets even if the transformation
of single rules' values failed. That way, you can at least work with
all of the other rules, and replace the offending ones.

If this affects you, you can simply re-run cmk-update-config.
