It was not possible to apply different thresholds to different services
monitored by the watchdog_sensors check. This was due to the fact that all
sensors are mapped to the same sensor ID, and it was therefore not possible to
match different rulesets to the different services. This has been fixed, so
that the full service description and sensor ID can be used for ruleset
matching.
If this fix is required, please rediscover the services of the affected hosts.
