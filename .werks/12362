NetApp Snapvault services are disovered using the names of the destination
volumes. For NetApp clustermode installations, however, the destination volume
names may not be unique, leading to missing Snapvault services. This has been
fixed by including the destination Vserver (SVM) in the item description. Please
rediscover the services of your NetApp hosts to apply this fix.
If you are sure that your destination volume names are unique, and you would
like to continue using them as the item description, you can do so by selecting
the "Exclude destination vserver" option in the "Discovery parameters for
NetApp snapvault" ruleset. In this case, you do not need to rediscover the
services.
We strongly advise using the full item description for the services, as this is
guaranteed to be unique. This is also the default behaviour of the discovery of
this check going forward.
