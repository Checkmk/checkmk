It's possible to have same-named hosts on different, connected sites. If the
HW/SW Inventory is enabled on these hosts then the link to a host's inventory
tree view displays the trees of all same-named hosts on the same page.

In general it's not possible to display any of these inventory trees because
it's undecidable which inventory tree data belongs to which host: the host
inventory tree data was created locally or synced (eg. via liveproxyd). In this
case the data of the local host might have been overwritten by the remote one
(or the other way round).
