During an update from 1.6.0 to 2.0.0 the deprecated ruleset {{Hosts not using Inline-SNMP}}
is transformed to the new ruleset {{Hosts using a specific SNMP Backend}}.
This did not work properly and resulted in a hanging update process with the error message:
{{Bad Host SNMP Backend configuration}}.
