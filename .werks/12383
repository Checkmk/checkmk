On SLES15SP2 server device names like {{/dev/sda1}} for btrfs filesystem may
change after a reboot. Afterwards the filesystem service reports
{{UNKNOWN - Item not found in agent output}}.

In order to solve this problem the UUID (from the command 'lsblk') can be used
as item part. Basically items of btrfs filesystem services have the form
{{btrfs DEVICE-NAME}} resp. {{btrfs UUID}}. This behaviour is configurable
via {{Mountpoint for block devices}}.

Within the ruleset {{Filesystem discovery}} you can additonally add
{{Volume name}} or {{UUID}} to every service via the option {{Item appearance}}.
For btrfs this option would lead to items like {{DEVICE-NAME btrfs DEVICE-NAME}}
resp. {{UUID btrfs UUID}}.

Moreover it's not allowed to mix {{Volume name}} and {{UUID}} in the parameters
{{Mountpoint for block devices}}, {{Item appearance}} or {{Grouping}}.

To make this work you have to install the newest {{check_mk_agent}} for Linux.
