Version: 2.0.0p7

Plugins in the folder {{/usr/check_mk/lib/plugins/NUMBER}} are executed
asynchronously. Since Checkmk version 2.0.0b4 it was broken because in ksh,
dash or similar the following command in the run_cached function
C+:
sh -c "COMMAND-STRING"
C-:
expects executable commands/files but not inline functions.
