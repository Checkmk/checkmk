Previously there was only a {{path}} and {{attributes}} field which was used
for an extension of the HW/SW Inventory which will allow adding single values,
table columns or categories to one single path.

Now there are three different input fields for single values, table columns or
categories. In order to stay compatible with previously configured settings,
the value of the {{attributes}} field is now used for single values and table
columns. This won't lead to unexpected filtered trees because the HW/SW
Inventory tree has either {{single values}} or {{tables}} below a given path
but not both.

We recommend cleaning up the transformed permitted paths because in the future
the tree structure may have single values and tables side-by-side below a path.
