With this change the bookmark for the network topology includes
<ul>
<li>Current filters</li>
<li>Number of configured hops</li>
<li>Number of max nodes</li>
<li>Current active overlays</li>
<li>The currently selected root nodes, growth nodes and growth forbidden nodes</li>
</ul>

In a later version of the network topology, the rearrangement of nodes will be supported.
Note: Since all of the above information is stored in one URL, the maximum number of options is limited. Quite high, but
still limited.
