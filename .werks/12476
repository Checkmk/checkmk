"Host report for multiple hosts" and "Service report of multiple services"
are elements that produce subreports where the context filters are directly
specified on the element configuration. The Web interface was not
presenting those filters to configuration neither was any filter action
occurring. The only correct behavior was from reports configured in version 1.5.0

This werk, restablishes the configuration possibilities available for this report elements.
