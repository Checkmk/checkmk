Event rates were displayed with at most a presision of 2 decimals on the
graphs, and was generally a good format. Yet, there are some cases when
monitoring very sporadic events, graphs would show a scale containing only
zeros.

After this werk, event rates follow the same scientific notation used on
other metrics like floating point numbers, counts and percent. This allows
to appropiately display numbers regardless of their domain range.
