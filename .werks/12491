The custom graph editor in a pursuit of convenience would save changes and
refresh the page on every change. This convenience resulted in a high
performance penalty when editing graphs with multiple metrics, as the entire
page would need to be rendered again, and specially recollecting data from the
RRD files.

With this Werk, the custom graph editor does not execute the page reload upon
changes.  The user is now responsible for this interaction. Following our UX
project, now there is an "Apply" button on the top left corner of the editor to
save and apply the changes to the graph. This allows users to place multiple
changes at once, without incurring in a performance penalty, due to the constant
refreshing of the editor.

Users do need to press the "Apply" button to save changes, it is now not enough
to just do changes and leave the editor.
