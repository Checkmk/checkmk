Network interfaces that provide multiline descriptions would crash their
corresponding service. In case that the rule "Network interface and switch port
discovery" was configured to "use description" for the "appearance of network
interface", all interfaces of the device stalled and remained on the PENDING
state. This is now fixed, yet you might need to rediscover your services.
