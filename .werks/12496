The special agent vsphere no longer collects data from a Checkmk
agent installed on the monitored system.

This incompatibility only affects users who had set one of the options
<i>"Queried host is a host system with Checkmk Agent installed"</i>
or
<i>"Queried host is the vCenter with Checkmk Agent installed"</i>
 in the WATO rule for the special agent vSphere.

These options are a relict from a time when a Checkmk host could only
have one data source. In this case the special agent vsphere could be
configured to contact the Checkmk agent in turn and forward the data.

Since Checkmk hosts can have multiple data sources, this option is
no longer needed.

Affected users must configure their hosts to use
<i>"Normal Checkmk agent, all configured special agents"</i>.
