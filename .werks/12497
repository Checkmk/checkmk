The active check <tt>check_dns</tt> of the <i>monitoring-plugins</i> package
no longer supports a comma separated list of expected addresses.

You must now specify exactly one address in each field of the WATO rule.
Additionally, you can now choose wether to expect all of the given addresses,
or any (i.e. at least one) of them.

By default we assume you expect all of the specified addresses to be returned.
Please revisit the WATO rule <i>"Check DNS service"</i>, to make sure it is
correct.
