This change only affect users with own SNMP section plugins
developed against the *new* API.

Previously the parse function of an SNMP section (or SNMP
check plugin) has only been called if at least *some* data
could be fetched from the host (the SNMP device).

In the old API (Checkmk version < 2.0) this behaviour
could be changed by setting the 'handle_empty_info' key -
only then would the parse function be called for empty
data.

The new API will *allways* call the parse function, if
the sections raw data is present in the fetched data (even
if it is empty). It is the programmers responsibility to
deal with an potentially empty data set.

This allows for a subtle distiction: If the parse function
returns `None`, no further processing is done, it is
regarded as 'not present'. An empty return value could
represent some valid information, such as an empty list
of error messages.

Note that this behaviour is consistent with the TCP data
sources' sections, where we also may encounter sections
that are present, but empty.
