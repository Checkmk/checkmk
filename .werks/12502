This werk only affects users that have certain custom plugins
developed against the old check API in a clustered setup.

Specificly: This affects you, if you have
<ul>
 <li>a custom check plugin</li>
 <li>using the <i>*_item_state</i> features <b>in the parse function</b></li>
 <li>in a clustered service setup</li>
</ul>

In this case, you probably observed crashes of the parse function or
stale services (we have never observed this theoretical bug).
This will be fixed. However: If this actually affected you, you should
consider moving all <i>item_state</i> related logic into the check
function (as this will be enforced by the new API).
