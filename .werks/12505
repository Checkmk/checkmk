This only affects users who have developed their own check plugins and are
using the <tt>clear_item_states_by_full_keys</tt> function of the <b>old</b>
check API. This function is no longer available.

It was only used to mitigate a very particular problem, that will not arise
when using the new check APIs <i>value store</i> concept.
