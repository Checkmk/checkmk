The absolute levels on memory usage were off by a factor of 1024^2.
With regards to configured WATO rules this is now fixed.

Additionally the default parameters were mistakenly taken to mean
70/80 MB (instead of percent).
To fix this either set up a WATO rule to override them, or rediscover
the service.
