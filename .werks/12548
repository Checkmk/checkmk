The command "cmk --scan-parents" was detecting all hosts to be not pingable in
previous Checkmk 2.0 releases on Checkmk servers that use a localized
environment.

For example Linux systems that have the locale set to de_DE
(LC_NUMERIC=de_DE.UTF-8) use "," as decimal separator which is then expected as
parameter format by the underlying "ping" command.

This issue is solved by disabling inheritance of the the systems locale
settings for Checkmk site environments. This should've been ensured by the
shipped ".profile" file but the mechanism was not covering all cases. It now
explicitly unsets already set locale related environment variables to disable
the locales in the site.
