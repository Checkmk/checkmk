Checkmk 2.0 was not able to display values of rules created with previous
Checkmk versions. The rules created with Checkmk 2.0 were also not displayed
correctly and additionally were not processed correctly during agent baking.

Rules created with previous 2.0 releases need to be deleted and recreated.
