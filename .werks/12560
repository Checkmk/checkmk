The livestatus proxy can be configured to cascade livestatus connections. The
feature was introduced with 1.5.0 by werk #5970 which describes how this can
be used.

In previous versions the livestatus proxy was always offering a plain text
livestatus connection. Even if the site configuration offered the option
"Encrypt communication". Changing the option simply did not have any effect.
Trying to connect to this socket using a livestatus client with encryption
enabled simply failed all the time.

With this change the livestatus proxy is now respecting the "Encrypt
communication" and offering a TLS encrypted server socket using the certificate
of the site where the livestatus proxy is running on.
