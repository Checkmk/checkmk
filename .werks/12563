Title: Dynamic host configuration: Fix displaying of errors from remote sites

The dynamic configuration can be configured to work in distributed setups. In
this scenario, the dcd on the remote site gathers the raw host information
(phase 1) and the central site compares the information from phase 1 with the
Checkmk configuration and creates or deletes hosts based on the results of the
comparison.

It is possible that the central site continues to operate even in the event of
a failure in the phase 1 execution on the remote site. In this situation the
error will only be visible in the <tt>var/log/dcd.log</tt> on the remote site.
On the central site, a) no update will be applied and b) the error message will
not be visible in the user interface.
