The logwatch check crashed when the option to reclassify error messages was
used in combination with regular expressions that contain a special character
escaped with a back slash. The error looks similar to this: "Exception:
MKGeneralException (Invalid regular expression 'some.random.file.exe\) has
opened key': unbalanced parenthesis at position 28)". This has been fixed.
Please be aware that you may need to review your regular expression patterns,
especially in the case of Windows file paths. Toggle inline help for more
information.
