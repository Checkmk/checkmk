The check entity_sensors_temp monitors temperature sensors on devices mapped to
the ENTITY-MIB. These sensors monitor the temperature of different hardware
components: CPU, chassis ambient, and accelerator. It does not make sense to
define a default upper temperature limit, as acceptable temperature levels vary
greatly across the different components. Default levels have therefore been
removed. It is still possible to configure upper temperature levels for each of
the sensors.
