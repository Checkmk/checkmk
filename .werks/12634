Title: check plugin register: raise error on duplicate plugin

This change is only relevant for customers who develop and maintain their own
checks.
In the event that the same check plugin exists in both check API paths (checks
and cmk/base/plugins/agent_based), the legacy check plugin overrides the new
plugin without generating an error or a warning. With this change, the API raises
an error in the event that the check plugin has been duplicated.
