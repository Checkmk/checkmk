The fileinfo and filestats rules have imprecise descriptions of upper levels
in their respective configuration rulesets. WARN and CRIT configuration
variables were described as "Warning/Critical if above", but the states were
already applied when the configured values were reached. This has been fixed by
changing the configuration descriptions to "Warning/Critical at or above".
