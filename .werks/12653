The agent_innovaphone is now ready to handle TLS connections.
The parameters "Protocol" and "SSL certificate verification" were added to agent_innovaphone.
The default parameter for "Prococol" is "HTTPS" and "SSL certificate verification" is enabled by default.
This werk is marked as incompatible, because the new default settings will forced to be secure even if
the old configuration was insecure.
If you want to keep the old default configuration you can change the protocol to "HTTP" and select
"Ignore certificate errors" for the option "SSL certificate verification".
