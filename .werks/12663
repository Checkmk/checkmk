Title: Fixed steadily rising CPU load due to misconfigured dashboard dashlets

The <tt>Host statistics</tt> and <tt>Service statistics</tt> dashlets had an increasing number of AJAX requests the
longer the dashboard stayed open. Over time, this flooded the Apache Web Server, increasing the CPU load.

This behaviour happens because the 1.6->2.0 config migration missed to convert these two dashlets to a different update mechanism.
As a workaround till version 2.0.0p9 you can simply remove and re-add the statistics snapins.
