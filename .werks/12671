The Linux agent provides a $REMOTE variable, that holds the IP address
of the calling Checkmk site, that is evaluated by some plugins and
mechanisms, namely:
<ul>
<li>Real-time checks</li>
<li>mk_logwatch plugin</li>
<li>mk_inventory plugin</li>
<li>sap_hana plugin</li>
</ul>

Until now, this variable was provided when calling the agent via xinetd
or ssh, but was missing when calling via systemd.

While the above mentioned plugins use this variable to maintain internal
states, and fall back to a single state file, if $REMOTE is missing,
the real-time checks won't work at all (as they then have no target to
send the UDP data to).

In order to apply this change, the Linux agents on the affected machines
have to be replaced. If you have automatic agent updates activated, this
will be done automatically.
