This Werk fixes a security issue that may arise from a misconfiguration
of real-time checks.

As mentioned in Werk <a href=https://checkmk.com/werk/8350>#8350</a>
(Introduction of real-time checks), a password has to be provided when
configuring real-time checks.<br>
When using the agent bakery, the ruleset "Encryption" is used to
provide the encryption password, while the real-time checks itself are
activated for the agents via the ruleset "Send data for real-time checks".
If the real-time checks get activated without providing a password, this
will result in an empty password, that will nevertheless be used by the agent
to encrypt the real-time check data on the host.<br>
While the user would most likely fix this situation, because real-time checks
won't work (A password is mandatory to activate real-time checks in CMC),
the real-time check data can be decrypted without a password/key in this case,
resulting in a security issue.

This is now fixed with the following mechanism:
<ul>
<li>The agent bakery will read the default password from the global setting
"Monitoring core/Enable handling of real-time checks" and bake it into the
agents that have the rule "Send data for real-time checks" activated. Accordingly,
a changed global setting will lead to new agents on next bake.</li>
<li>The agent bakery will keep to package the password from the "Encryption" rule,
and the Linux agent will prefer it over the default password from the CMC configuration.</li>
<li>If none of the two passwords are configured, but the "Send data for real-time checks"
rule is active, the agent bakery will refuse to bake agents.</li>
<li>If the Linux agent is requested to send encrypted real-time check data, but no password
is deployed, the sending be inhibited. However, up from now, this may only happen
if real-time checks are configured without the agent bakery.</li>
</ul>
