Werk #12149 states out that, on UNIX, a python agent plugin called <tt><em>plugin</em>.py</tt>
is always executed with Python 3, while a plugin called <tt><em>plugin</em>_2.py</tt> is always
executed with Python 2.

While an error will be communicated if there is no suitable Python installation available,
some other Python agent plugin related error situations pass silently. The cause for this is
that the agent assumes that python plugins always come as a pair of Python 3 and Python 2 version,
but this is not always the case in reality.

With this Werk, the communication is improved, by showing a WARN state in the Check_MK service
for the following situations:
<ul>
<li><tt><em>plugin</em>.py</tt> is deployed, but found no Python 3 installation, and there is no
<tt><i>plugin</i>_2.py</tt> counterpart. The reason "Missing Python 3 installation" will be
displayed alongside the failed plugin.</li>
<li>The other way round: <tt><em>plugin</em>_2.py</tt> is deployed, but found no Python 2
installation, and there is no <tt><i>plugin</i>.py</tt> counterpart. The reason "Missing Python 2
installation" will be displayed alongside the failed plugin.</li>
<ul>
