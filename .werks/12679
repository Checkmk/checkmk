Previously, the agent updater expected a "Content-Length" HTTP header in responses
from the Checkmk server, and crashed with error message<br>
<tt>KeyError: 'content-length'</tt><br>
if it was missing. However, the missing header only occurs in special scenarios, when the
agent updater doesn't communicate with the Checkmk server directly, e.g., when having a
(reverse) proxy in between.

This is fixed now.

This werk is marked as incompatible, because manual interaction might be needed
to overcome the error on a host. You can either install the newly baked agent
manually on affected hosts, or prevent the cause that leads to the missing "Content-Length"
header: An observed cause for the missing header can be an activated transport compression
at some point in the infrastructure between Checkmk server and host. To prevent this, you
can add the line<br>
<tt>SetEnv no-gzip dont-vary</tt><br>
at the top of the config file <tt>/etc/apache2/conf-enabled/zzz_omd.conf</tt> on the
server running Checkmk, and reload the system apache with <tt>systemctl reload apache</tt>.
