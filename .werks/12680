Previously, the RPM/DEB owned systemd units were placed at
/etc/systemd/system. Now, they are placed at /usr/lib/systemd/system/.
A sysadmin can now drop specific overrides into /etc/systemd/system/
to customize the units.

With this change users who want to customize specific systemd behaviour
can follow the officially documented systemd workflow to change only what
they want, resulting in a cleaner workflow.

This merges Github PR #240. Thanks go to jcpunk for contribution!
