The special agent for Kubernetes did not convert date and time strings received
from the Kubernetes cluster correctly to timestamps. This has been fixed.

Please note that the changing timestamp may temporarily affect the k8s_stats_fs
check's calculated average used for trend computation, which takes time to
smooth out.

If your host is affected and you would like to improve the averages it
produces, you can shorten the timespan for the calculated average: Setup ->
Services -> Service monitoring rules -> Filesystems (used space and growth).
Decrease the value of the parameter "Time range for trend computation".

Alternatively, you can reset the host's counters by removing the file
~/tmp/check_mk/counters/HOST. This means trend computations are started from
scratch.
