The "Activate Changes" functionality creates a number of temporary directories
under tmp, which are periodically removed by a cleanup job "Activation
Cleanup". This job was not able to repair itself in the event that it had a
broken or empty status file:
~/var/check_mk/background_jobs/activation_cleanup/jobstatus.mk. This has been
fixed, so that the job can continue to run.
