Datafiles and transactionlogs services of MSSQL databases showed "unlimited" or
the maximum configured log size as their maximum size, without taking into
account how much free space there is on the filesystem on which they are kept.
The maximum size is now capped at the available filesystem size in order to
show a true reflection of the maximum size they can take.
