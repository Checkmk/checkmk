Title: esx_vshpere_hostsystem_cpu: added cluster check

The cluster check "esx_vsphere_hostsystem_cpu_util_cluster" was configurable in
the enforced services and was working up until Checkmk version 1.6. This check
has been removed. Instead, the cluster functionality has been implemented and
consolidated with the standard check for CPU utilization of ESX vSphere host
systems, "esx_vsphere_hostsystem_cpu_usage". As a result, the ruleset
has also been modified. Please migrate any rules configured for the checks
"esx_vsphere_hostsystem_cpu_usage" and
"esx_vsphere_hostsystem_cpu_util_cluster" to the new ruleset "ESX Vsphere host
system CPU utilization" to continue using them.
