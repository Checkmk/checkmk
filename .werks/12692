Title: k8s_replicas: proper check message when replicas data is not available

Version: 2.1.0b1

In some instances, the Kubernetes replicas information is either incomplete or
not available. The unavailability is usually of short period. In the previous version,
this led to failure of the check. This werk introduces a mechanism to handle this event.
The check initially goes into a stale state before displaying a crit status if the data
is unavailable for more than 10 minutes.
