With Checkmk 2.0 we have splitted the Microcore Checkmk helper
processes into Fetcher and Checker helpers.  Since this split,
the service check timeout of the "Check_MK" and "Check_MK
Discovery" services (as configured via setup) was not applied
to the whole check execution pipeline.

The timeout was applied to the fetcher execution before, which
is normally taking most of the time.  But there are also cases
where the execution of the checker takes too long, reaching the
configured timeout.

With this change we now apply the service check timeout to the
whole pipeline, including the processing in the checker helpers._
