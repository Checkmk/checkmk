The Livestatus socket can be configured to be reachable over the
network (details can be found under
https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/livestatus.html#network).
This is needed for, e.g., building distributed environments with Checkmk.

In previous releases this network connection was managed by a
site-specific xinetd instance.  Since xinetd is not available on newer
Linux distributions, we have added an alternative mode of managing
the socket using systemd.

All Checkmk sites on Linux distributions with a systemd version newer or
equal to version 235 that have the LIVESTATUS_TCP option enabled (see
abover for a link to the manual) automatically and seamlessly switch to
the new systemd-managed socket after upgrading to Checkmk 2.1.  Older
Linux distributions keep using xinetd.

Users are advised to double-check the systemd configuration under
<tt>$OMD_ROOT/etc/mk-livestatus/livestatus.socket</tt> and
<tt>$OMD_ROOT/etc/mk-livestatus/livestatus@.service</tt>.
