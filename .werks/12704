Title: Do not create Carbon data if no connection is configured

The core would create and enqueue data for the Carbon connection
even if none is configured.  This may incur a small performance
penalty and, provided the site generates a large amount of data,
log messages such as
<tt>[carbon connection pool] queue full, didn't push update</tt>
that are irrelevant.

This fix only sends data to the Carbon connection if necessary.
