The service Check_MK Discovery could produce a crash report with the
error "Checker and fetcher mismatch" if the address of an SNMP host
cannot be resolved.  Alternatively, the service would be OK although
the host was not checked.

Now, the service for the unreachable host will fail consistently (CRIT)
with the error: "Host has no IP address configured".
