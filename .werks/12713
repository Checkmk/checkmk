Title: check_ps: Check goes UNKN if configured to show percentage of RAM in some cases

check_ps was not configured to use data from <<<statgrab_mem>>> section which made the total RAM
unavailable on systems providing <<<statgrab_mem>>> rather than <<<mem>>>, rendering "Process"
Services UNKNOWN.
This change makes check_ps use <<<statgrab_mem>>> again, restoring the behavior of version 1.6.0
and below.
