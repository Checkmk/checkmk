`hrStorageType` defines the type of information provided via SNMP handled by `hr_mem`. Very often
invalid values for `hrStorageType` are being provided, which leads to unhandled ValueError()
exceptions.
This change makes the plugin not crash on invalid values but instead return a special string
"unknown" as value for `hr_type` which then can be handled properly by the checks which handle
the data provided by `hr_mem`.
