This werk improves the monitoring of Cisco ASA Failover setups (check
plugin <tt>cisco_asa_failover</tt>).

<ul>
<li>The corresponding service is now also discovered on Cisco
Firepower devices.</li>
<li>The service is renamed from "Cluster Status" to "Failover Status".
Already existing services will continue to work, however, new services
will be detected under the new name. This renaming is necessary because
ASA clusters are something completely different than ASA failover pairs.
In ASA clusters, up to 16 identical devices are connected by a control
link and they all handle traffic at the same time. Cisco ASA failover
pairs on the other hand consist of two identical devices connected by a
failover link. Only one of the these devices, the active one, handles
traffic. The other one is in standby and only takes over in case the
active unit fails.</li>
<li>The check plugin now has two additional configuration options 
(ruleset "Failover states"): the monitoring status in case either the
local or the remote device are not active or in standby and the
monitoring status in case the failover link is not up. Previously,
these monitoring statuses we hard-coded to WARN and CRIT, which is still
the default.</li>
</ul>
