The SMART agent plugin now attempts to exclude devices which
can read CDs. Such devices do not support SMART and not
excluding them can lead to hanging <tt>smartctls</tt>
processes. The plugin attempts to exclude such devices based
on the output of <tt>udevadm</tt>, if this command is found.

Note that you need to update the agents on affected linux hosts
for this werk to come into effect.
