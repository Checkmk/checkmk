This werk fixes two problems regarding the start url option in the user profile
settings.

The values of this settings were only taken into account, if the option "Set as
start URL" in dashboards was used.
Existing entries were not recognized.

Furthermore, it was not possible to edit and save a user profile of a user, who
has used the option "Set as start URL", leading into an error "The given value
is not allowed. You may only configure relative URLs".
