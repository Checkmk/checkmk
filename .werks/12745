If you changed event console rules in a distributed setup with enabled event
console on remote sites, the changes were not shown on the "Activate changes"
page for the remote sites. That way you could not synchronize this event
console changes unless other changes were made that need a synchronisation.

If you discover problems with regard to event console rules on remote sites,
save the corresponding event console rule again and activate the changes.
