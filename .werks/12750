If you searched e.g. for "Proxmox", the first search entries after sections
"Hosts" and "Setup" shown were from "Service monitoring rules", what is
difficult to understand, especially for new users.

The search results will now show section "VM, Cloud, Container" entries first,
because this section contains the rule to to start monitoring Proxmox.

This change also applies for rules in section "Other integrations".
