If a "Recent notification (for analysis)" in Setup -> Events -> Notifications
was replayed an error message was shown in the User interface. Furthermore,
the error message:

invalid signal byte ASCII 76, expected '*'
read 76 further bytes: 'oading autochecks from /omd/sites/stable/var/check_mk/autochecks/stable.mk

was logged in the cmc.log if a notification was sent. This is fixed.
