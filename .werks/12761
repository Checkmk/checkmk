You can now use the discovery ruleset "Rittal CMC III discovery" to
configure sensors to use the sensor description as an item. Additionally,
the descriptions are prefixed with the device number and sensor id to
be unique. An example of a service description of a sensor is e.g.
"1-7 fire pre alarm".

For backwards compatibility reasons some check plugins like e.g.
cmciii_temp still use a prefix before the number and description, like
"Temperature 4-3 Dew Point". If you want to alter this behaviour the
ruleset "Translation of service descriptions" can be used.

To make it easier to associate the sensors with the devices the device
number is added before the device name in the cmciii plugin for the
device state.
