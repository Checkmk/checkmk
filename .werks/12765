The performance problems described below only affect you, if your Kubernetes cluster
exposes metrics in custom.metrics.k8s.io.

The deprecations of the plugins only affect you, if you applied the YAML files
mentioned in ~/share/doc/check_mk/treasures/kubernetes/readme.md and services with
the description "Memory usage for pods in NAMESPACE namespace", "CPU usage for pods in
NAMESPACE namespace" or "CPU usage for Pods in NAMESPACE namespace" are present in
your cluster where NAMESPACE is the name of a namespace in your cluster.

Previous versions of the Kubernetes special agent processed metrics delivered by the
custom.metrics.k8s.io endpoint. The metrics were provided e.g. by applying the YAML
files mentioned in ~/share/doc/check_mk/treasures/kubernetes/readme.md.

The special agent of Kubernetes could run into performance problems and timeouts if
metrics were present under custom.metrics.k8s.io. Furthermore, the custom metrics
were not compatible with newer versions of Kubernetes and scrape targets of the more
recent special agent for Prometheus delivers data for CPU, Filesystems, Disk IO and
Memory, as well. Additionally, the Prometheus agent is capable to execute
custom PromQL queries for advanced use cases.

For this reason the Kubernetes special agent does not process custom metrics anymore
and the accompanying check plugins and rulesets are deprecated. The corresponding
services and rules should be removed. Instructions on how to use the Prometheus
special agent can be found in the user guide:
