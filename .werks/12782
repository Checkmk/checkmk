A host is created for each kubernetes endpoint. On a checkmk site with disabled
inventory (the default) the endpoint host does not have any services.

As Hosts without services are invalid, checkmk automatically adds a ping
service which fails, because the endpoint host is created from piggyback data
and ist not reachable. The error message looks like:
"check_icmp: No hosts to check"

This werk adds the label "cmk/kubernetes:yes" to kubernetes related hosts, so
the issue can now be fixed by creating an inventory rule that activates the
inventory on kubernetes endpoint hosts:

Go to "Setup" &rarr; "HW/SW inventory rules" &rarr; "Do hardware/software
inventory" &rarr; "Create rule in folder":

<ul>
<li>"Status data inventory" &rarr; "Do status data inventory"</li>
<li>"Host labels" &rarr; "has" &rarr; "cmk/kubernetes:yes"</li>

&rarr; Save

This werk alters the default configuration. Sites created with checkmk 2.0.0p4
or later automatically enable the inventory for kubernetes objects.
