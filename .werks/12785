Chromium based browsers showed an error message in the developer tools:

<tt>Error: &lt;rect&gt; attribute width: A negative value is not valid.</tt>

This error was provoked by a broken windowing function in the python
implementation and is now fixed.

Furthermore the calculation of the windowing function was adapted:
Before the first and last Bar was not a full sized window based on the
current time. Now all time windows have the same duration.
