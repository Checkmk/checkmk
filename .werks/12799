The Checkmk Raw Edition now allows service descriptions to use round brackets.
Previously this was inconsistent with the Checkmk Enterprise Editions
and has now been consolidated.

Services which were often affected by this issue were the logfiles monitored on Windows
systems.
When a path contains round brackets, the service description was not named as expected.

Illegal characters for Nagios:  `;~!$%^&*|\'"<>?,=
Illegal character for CMC:         \t
