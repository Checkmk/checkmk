The active check check_mail_loop crashed with the error "RuntimeError("Server responded b'+OK 1 messages:', [...]")"
if the response from the server contained more characters than just "+OK". E.g. the result
"+OK, 1 messages" would have lead to an error.
The bugfix contains a more tolerant verification of the result.
