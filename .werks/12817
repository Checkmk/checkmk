A postgres instance will be detected as running
if a process is found that contains a postgres commandline
which contains the name of the env-file.
Otherwise the check "SQL Instance" will show the
following error message "Instance <INSTANCE_NAME> not running or postgres DATADIR name is not identical with instance name.".
