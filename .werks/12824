Title: UCS Bladecenter: support monitoring of racks and blades in the same ucs domain

In previous versions only the racks were shown and blades were ignored if racks and blades existed in
the same ucs domain.
The special agent "UCS Bladecenter" now supports this usecase by detecting automatically the model type (rack or blade).

You need to rediscover your services in order to apply this bugfix.
