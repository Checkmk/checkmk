The speed of status view loads has been improved with a larger number of users.
Previous Checkmk versions were scanning the user profile directories multiple
times for loading different types of custom elements (views, dashboards,
reports, ...). Some of them were loaded multiple times which increased the
overall load time of views especially with a larger number of users. We have
now removed these redundancies.
