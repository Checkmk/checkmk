Each user that is able to log into the Checkmk GUI gets a user profile
directory created below <tt>var/check_mk/web/[user_id]</tt>.

During deletion of a user, the profile directory is not deleted automatically.
This is done to prevent loss of user configurations when users are deleted
accidentally and recreated later.

While this is helpful for the case mentioned above, this may result in
abandoned user profile directories. Especially in the case where a large number
of users was created (e.g. by an LDAP synchronization) and later removed, this
could lead to a large number of directories. With a large number of
directories, this may even affect the performance of different parts of the
GUI.

The now introduced housekeeping logic will detect all directories not belonging
to an existing user. For each of these directories it will find the most recent
modified file. In case this file modification is older than 30 days, the
profile directory will be deleted.
