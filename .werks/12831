This change fixes a layout problem of reports or PDF exports of views
containing graph columns which fill multiple pages. Previous Checkmk versions
were displaying one or multiple empty pages in such a situation or pages which
are not fully populated by graphs.

The layout of graphs columns has now been improved to work better in common
situation.  Even though the new layout algorithm is better than the previous
one in specific situations, there are still several cases that are not handled
ideally. To improve this further would require major rebuilding work that
cannot be done as part of a bug fix of the stable version.
