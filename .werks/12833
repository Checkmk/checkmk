Previous Checkmk 2.0 releases could logout an active login sessions of a user
when the same user was used from multiple clients (e.g. different browsers,
GUI, API, or nagstamon). This was caused by an invalid session cleanup
mechanism.

Background: With Checkmk 2.0 a new login sessions tracking was introduced.
This session tracking allows up to 20 active login sessions for a single user.
Once the 21st login session is opened, a cleanup mechanism is triggered which
cleans up a) all sessions except the newest 20 sessions and b) all sessions
which were inactive for 7 days. Instead of keeping the newest sessions, the it
was keeping the oldest sessions which lead to the active sessions being logged
out in the moment the cleanup was triggered.
