The rulesets "Host labels" and "Service labels" can not use host or service
labels as conditions.  However, previous Checkmk versions allowed it to refer
to predefined conditions which have label conditions. In case this was
configured, this lead to exceptions during config creation.

With this change, this configuration issue is now validated and an error
message is displayed in the moment one tries to assign a predefined condition
with labels to a "Host labels" or "service labels" rule.
