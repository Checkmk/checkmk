The assignment of contact groups to hosts and services can be controlled using
the folder hierarchy of WATO as described in the user manual
(https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/wato_user.html#_allocation_via_folders).

You are only affected by this change in case you use a) the WATO folder hierarchy
for assigning contact groups to services.

When using the assigning contact groups to services with the following
settings, this could result in too many groups being assigned to a service:

<ul>
<li>Add these groups as contacts to all hosts in this folder: Enabled</li>
<li>Add these groups as contacts to all hosts in all subfolders of this folder: Not enabled</li>
<li>Always add these groups as contacts to all services in all subfolders of this folder: Enabled</li>
</ul>

In this situation only the groups from the nearest parent folder should be
assigned to the services, just like it is done for the hosts. Instead the
services got the groups assigned from all parent folders which have the
service assignement enabled.

We now have changed the contact groups of the services to be handled exactly
like the hosts. Only the contact groups defined in the nearest parent folder
with the service assignment enabled will be added to the services.

Example:

<code>
Folder_A (Permission: group1, settings as listed above)
|_Folder_B (Permission: group2, settings as listed above)
</code>

In this scenario, a host in the Folder_B gets the contact group "group2"
assigned. Services got the "group1" and "group2" assingned in previous
versions.  Now the services get the "group2" assigned, just like the host.
