Renaming hosts in general is already executed in a background job
to prevent timeouts. But in distributed setups, when renaming a
host on a remote site, a longer taking renaming could result in
timeout errors. Errors like this could appear:

C+:
MKAutomationException: Got invalid data: Your request timed out after 110
seconds. This issue may be related to a local configuration problem or a
request which works with a too large number of objects. But if you think this
issue is a bug, please send a crash report.
C-:

With this change also the remote actions are executed asynchronously in a
background job and as a result will not result in a timeout anymore.
