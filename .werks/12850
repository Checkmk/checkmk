Users which execute <tt>omd mv</tt> or <tt>omd cp</tt> expect Checkmk to not
only rename the site, but also migrate the Checkmk configuration in a way that
they can continue seamlessly with their existing Checkmk configuration.

This feature did not exist before and was a common misunderstanding. The
commands listed above did not take care of the Checkmk configuration files. In
fact the site management, which is realizing the renaming of a site, does not
know anything about the Checkmk configuration files.

However, with this change we create the integration of both worlds. In the
moment a site renaming or copy is performed, the site management informs
Checkmk about this action and gives it the chance to update it's configuration
files.

The most important parts of the Checkmk configuration are now updated:

<ul>
<li>Distributed monitoring (sites) configuration</li>
<li>Host & folder site attributes</li>
<li>Dynamic host configuration site attribute</li>
</ul>

The new logic is also trying to detect specific situations and displays
warnings about things that can (currently) not be migrated automatically.

For example, if the renaming of a distributed remote site is detected, a
warning is now displayed that you also have to update the distributed
monitoring configuration in the central site of your setup.

<i>Details:</i>

OMD, which is responsible for providing the site management of Checkmk, itself
is only caring about migrating the files and file parts that are initially
installed when creating a new Checkmk site. <b>Clearer:</b> If you create a
clean site and then execute <tt>grep -r $OMD_SITE etc</tt> in your site, you
can see a lot of files which contain the ID of the site. These things are
already migrated by OMD.

But OMD is not aware of the configuration files of the applications shipped
with OMD. For example the Checkmk configuration files are not understood by
OMD. And that's totally fine from an architectural point of view, because OMD
is an separate component that manages installation of different applications,
but must not mess with their individual files.

However, from a users perspective it's clear that you also want the application
files to be migrated during site renaming.

This change introduces the general mechanism:

<ul>
<li>OMD detects changes of the site ID (mv, cp or restore)</li>
<li>Then it executes the command <tt>post-rename-site -v -o [OLD_SITE_ID]</tt></li>
<li>The command <tt>post-rename-site</tt> then takes care of the Checkmk
  configuration updates</li>
<li>It can also detect some situations it can not solve on it's own
  and warns the user about potential manual steps to do afterwards.</li>
</ul>

The migration steps are realized in so called rename action plugins which can
easily be extended. In the git you can find them at
<tt>cmk/post_rename_site/plugins/actions</tt>.
