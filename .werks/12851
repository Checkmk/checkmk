Users with the "User" role which are able to manage a folder in "Hosts &
folders" can add and remove permissions of contact groups on a folder. These
users should only be able to add / remove contact groups they are a member of.

However, in previous releases it was possible to add one group to the permitted
groups of a folder he is not a member of. But when trying to remove the group,
this was denied because the user is not a member of this group.

The logic has now been changed to provide the user a consistent behaviour: In
the moment a user tries to add OR remove a contact group, it is verified that
the user is a member of that group. The user can now really only add OR remove
groups he is a member of.

Groups which are permitted on this folder and are not modified by the user are
not relevant in this situation.
