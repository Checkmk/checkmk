Filtering for host or service labels could lead to a memory leak in large
setups with a large count of labels. With every character entered in the search
field, one ajax call was created while the answer of the first fired ajax call
was not already there.

Therefore, labels are now cached in the shipped Redis database and the search
input field was improved with a 300ms delay while typing new characters.

The initial building of the Redis cache should be able to process ~60k
labels/s. Depending of the count of labels in your setup, the first display of
search results may take a certain amount of time.
