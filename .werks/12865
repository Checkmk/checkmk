If a user with less permissions edited a duallist element (two lists with
interchangable elements) like e.g. the "Match site" criteria in event console
rules, the user could overwrite previously set values of users with more
permissions, because he was not able to see elements he is not permitted for.

The count of such elements will now be shown as "3 locked sites" entry in
the "Match site" criteria of event console rules. This entry is disabled and
can not be moved to unselected.
