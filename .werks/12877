The check plugin <tt>printer_supply</tt>, which monitors the fill levels of
printer supplies via SNMP, is now able to handle trailing null bytes in the
field prtMarkerColorantValue (observed for example for HP Jetdirect 153).
Previously, such null bytes broke the displaying of the corresponding service
output in the GUI.
