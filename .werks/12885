The interface check <tt>if64</tt> always displays the operational status
<tt>ifOperStatus</tt> of the interface. Furthermore, it can be configured to
fetch and display the admin status <tt>ifAdminStatus</tt>. For both states,
there are configuration options to map them to monitoring states (eg.
ifOperStatus=up --> OK, ifOperStatus=down --> CRIT).

However, before this werk, there was no option to assign a monitoring state
to a <i>combination</i> of an operational and an admin state. With the
additional configuration option introduced by this werk, you can for example
configure that an interface which is down <i>and</i> admin down should be
considered OK. Such a setting will only apply to interfaces matching the
configured operational <i>and</i> the configured admin state. For example, an
interface which is down but admin up would not be affected.
