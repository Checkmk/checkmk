If the management board address of a host has been provided
as a name (not an IP address) Checkmks DNS lookup cache has
not been effective.

While this was consistent with the behaviour of the IP address
configuration of the hosts (as documented here:
https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/wato_hosts.html#dns), it
lead to a lot of DNS lookups.

The management board address is now treated analogous to the
host name: If it is a name (not an IP address), it will be
resolved during "activate changes", reducing the number of
required DNS lookups.

In the rare case your management board has a dynamic IP
address, you must configure the entire host to use dynamic
lookup using the WATO rule "Hosts with dynamic DNS lookup".
