If the management board address of a host has been provided
as a name (not an IP address) Checkmks DNS lookup cache has
not been effective, leading to a lot of DNS lookups.

This is fixed now. In the rare case your management board
has a dynamic IP address, you must configure the entire host
to use dynamic lookup using the WATO rule
"Hosts with dynamic DNS lookup".
