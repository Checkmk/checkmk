This incompatible API change only affects users who use
the function <tt>run_cached</tt> exported by the agents.

The function no longer accepts the options <tt>-s</tt>,
 <tt>-m</tt> or <tt>-am</tt>.

The functions synopsis is now <tt>run_cached NAME MAXAGE COMMAND</tt>
<ol>
  <li><tt>name</tt>: The name of the cache file</li>
  <li><tt>maxage</tt>: The time in seconds the generated data should be considered valid</li>
  <li><tt>command</tt>: The command to generate the data</li>
</ol>

In particular the removal of the '-s' option means you now have to
include the creation of the section header in your command.
