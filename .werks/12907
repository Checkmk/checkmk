When deploying the checkmk agent on systemd based systems, users
often encountered problems when hitting the limit of 3 connections
per source (the monitoring server in this case).

In addition the real time checks would not work for the same reason.

This was due to systemd not terminating the connection until all
child processes started by the agent had completed, including the
started updates of the cached plugins, which were meant to be executed
asynchronously.

This is solved by adding a second service to checkmks systemd units:

<tt>check-mk-agent@.service</tt>: The preexisting service.
It is triggered by a remote connection of the monitoring server to the socket.
This service no longer triggers the asynchronous jobs.
It only outputs the available results.

<tt>check-mk-agent-async.service</tt>: The new service.
It consists of an agent process kept running in the background.
It checks every 60 seconds wether new asynchronous jobs need to be started,
to update the caches for cached plugins, and (if configured) run the real time checks.
The created monitoring data is stored on disk.

The (preexisting) agent process triggered by the socket will then output
the prepared cached information.
