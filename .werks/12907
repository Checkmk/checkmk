When deploying the checkmk agent on systemd based systems,
users often encountered problems when hitting the limit of
3 connections per source (the monitoring server in this
case).

The problem of hitting the connection limit was caused by
systemd not terminating the connection when the agent
finished.
Instead systemd waited for all child processes to finish
(in particular the started cache refreshes).
As a result, the connection was kept alive while the
plugins executed that had been deliberately configured to
run in the background.

This is solved by adding a second service to checkmks
systemd units:

<tt>check-mk-agent@.service</tt>: The preexisting service.
It is triggered by a remote connection of the monitoring
server to the socket.
This service no longer triggers the asynchronous jobs.
It only outputs the available results (which may be waiting
in cache files).

<tt>check-mk-agent-async.service</tt>: The new service.
It consists of an agent process kept running in the
background.
It checks every 60 seconds wether new asynchronous jobs
need to be started, to update the caches for cached
plugins (and run the real time checks, see below).
The created monitoring data is stored on disk.

The <tt>check-mk-agent@.service</tt> triggered by the
socket will then output the prepared cached information.

<b>Known limitations:</b>

Unfortunately this is not the only problem when using
systemd: The real-time checks are still not working.
This issue will be fixed separately.
