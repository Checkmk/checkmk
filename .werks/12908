This werk changes the behaviour of (some) services on clusters.

Affected services will go to UNKNOWN. To fix this, users must
explicitly select the cluster mode they wish to use.
This can be done using the ruleset
<i>"Aggregation options for clustered services"</i>.

All services written against the old API are affected, and few
of the modern plugins (see below for a list of the latter).

Since this is the second time the behaviour of clustered services
changes (1.6 to 2.0 and 2.0 to 2.1), we provide an overview.
Note that we must consider four types of plugins here:
Plugins programmed against the old API (refered to as 'legacy')
or the new API ('modern'), and plugins developed with their
behaviour on clusters explicitly considered ('native cluster mode')
or not.

<b>In Checkmk 1.6 and earlier</b> all plugins (now legacy) can be
configured to run on a cluster. For plugins without a native
cluster implementation, the behaviour is unspecified.
They simply operate on the concatenated output of all nodes,
which may or may not result in the desired behaviour (or even crash).

<b>In Checkmk 2.0</b> the behaviour for legacy plugins is unchanged.
Modern plugins can only be run on a cluster, if they natively
implement a cluster mode.
Otherwise the service will be in a permanent WARNING state,
telling the user to change their configuration.

<b>In Checkmk 2.1</b> even legacy plugins are no longer run
on clusters in this unspecified manner.
By default, all services on a cluster are run in the native
mode (or issueing a WARNING if it does not exist).
If the plugin in question does not support a native cluster
mode, you can use the ruleset
<i>"Aggregation options for clustered services"</i> to
select one of three other aggregation modes (<i>"failover"</i>,
<i>"worst"</i>, <i>"best"</i>), where the results of the
individual nodes are aggregated in a predetermined way.

For a description of the available modes please refer to the
mentioned rulesets help.

The native cluster mode should be documented in the plugins
man page.

As a result some of the native implementations have been removed,
as they re-implemented one of the other aggregation modes (only
with fewer options).
These are the affected plugins and the cluster modes they
were implicitly operating on:

<ul>
  <li>apache_status: <i>failover</i></li>
  <li>cmk_site_statistics: <i>failover</i></li>
  <li>f5_bigip_vcmpguests: <i>worst</i></li>
  <li>infoblox_node_services: <i>best</i></li>
  <li>infoblox_services: <i>best</i></li>
  <li>job, local: The cluster behaviour has been configurable
      for these plugins. Choose according to your previous
      configuration. The options in the plugin specific rulesets
      are ignored.</li>
  <li>livestatus_status: <i>failover</i></li>
  <li>mrpe: <i>best</i></li>
  <li>mssql_counters_cache_hits, mssql_counters_file_sizes,
      mssql_counters_locks, mssql_counters_locks_per_batch,
      mssql_counters_page_life_expectancy,
      mssql_counters_pageactivity, mssql_counters_sqlstats,
      mssql_counters_transactions: <i>worst</i></li>
  <li>mssql_datafiles, mssql_transactionlogs: <i>failover</i></li>
  <li>netscaler_sslcertificates: <i>worst</i></li>
  <li>sap_hana_diskusage, sap_hana_ess, 'sap_hana_events,
      sap_hana_instance_status, sap_hana_memrate,
      sap_hana_proc, sap_hana_replication_status: <i>best</i></li>
</ul>

<b>Note to developers:</b> Every plugin you develop will have the
predefined cluster modes ready to use -- there is nothing you have to
do. If none of the three modes <i>failover</i>, <i>worst</i> or
<i>best</i> suit your needs, you can implement your own <i>native</i>
mode using the <tt>cluster_check_function</tt>. Please refer to the
sphinx documentation for details.
