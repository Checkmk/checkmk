When using the inline SNMP backend a timeout of the "Check_MK" and
"Check_MK Discovery" service would result in the service state UNKNOWN
and the output <i>"<built-in function getbulk> returned a result with an error set"</i>.
This is not very helpful.

The service now goes to CRIT, displaying <i>"Fetcher for host 'my_host' timed out after 60 seconds"</i>.
