If you have "Cisco IP SLA X" services you need to rediscover the
affected services, so that the new stable service discriptions will
be active.

Previously, the check plugin cisco_ip_sla used service descriptions
starting from 0, e.g. "Cisco IP SLA 0", "Cisco IP SLA 1", etc. This
had the drawback that if "Cisco IP SLA 0" is removed "Cisco IP SLA 1"
will become the new "Cisco IP SLA 0" and so on.

To circument this issue the plugin now uses the indices (OID end)
provided by SNMP. If now e.g. "Cisco IP SLA 6" is removed it will
not affect services that are defined later like e.g. "Cisco IP SLA 7".
