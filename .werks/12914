Previously, any non-ASCII characters in the output of the the mssql.vbs agent plugin
were removed. As a result, the services were assigned incorrect (truncated) names.
Now the plugin uses UTF-16 to encode its output and service names are displayed
correctly. You have to rediscover the affected services.
