Starting from Checkmk version 2.0 the description was only shown in the service details.
Only the name, location and contact were shown in the service summary.

For many devices the description contains useful information like e.g. the firmware
version. One use case before the 2.0 was e.g to search for the SNMP Info service of
devices and compare the information contained in the description. To achieve the same
result in verion 2.0 until now it was necessary to add the service details to the views.

This werk puts the description in the summary again, along with the location, name, and
contact.
