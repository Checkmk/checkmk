Previously the ETag/If-Match header pair were required to have a hexadecimal
pattern of 32 bytes length. This was not honored by some endpoints, resulting
in bad requests that should have been OK. This restriction has now been lifted
and ETags can have any string content.

There is no furhter action necessary.
