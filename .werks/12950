Starting from 2.0.0p5, some default tag groups like "tag_criticality",
did not appear in the REST API unless one logged in first and after-
wards restarted the Apache process. This is now fixed: the default
tag groups will appear in the REST specification by default.

No further action by the user is neccessary.
