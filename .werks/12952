Title: REST API: make endpoint responses more specific

Version: 2.0.0p8

Some endpoints of host_config and folder_config had the unspecific endpoint-type of
DomainObject and DomainObjectCollection. These have now been upgraded to HostConfigCollection,
HostConfigObject, FolderObject and FolderCollection.

Some automatically generated API clients for statically typed programming languages may
throw exceptions after these changes. You will have to recreate your API client based on
the specification provided with the 2.0.0p8 release.

The behaviour of the endpoints have not been changes, so if you use an API client in a
dynamically typed language or a hand-written one, you may not have to change anything.
