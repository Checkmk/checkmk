Title: response conversion of all endpoints of REST API

In a previous Werk (12951) some endpoints have been switched over to be
in line with the OpenAPI specification. This Werk switches all other endpoints
over. As for incompatibilities: only the password GET endpoints had deviations
from the specification.

If you use an automatically generated API-client, you may need to regenerate
your API client if you experience errors on these endpoints.
