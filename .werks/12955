Title: host collection response in REST API

Up until Checkmk 2.0.0p8 the responses of all host_config collections, due to a bug,
did not contain the attributes, members and links of the host_config objects.

This werk fixes these responses, but changes the OpenAPI specification, so you may
need to recompile your API client.
