As stated in the <a href="https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/localchecks.html">documentation</a>,
min/max values are optional in the output of local checks. However, this
was not fully implemented. Omitting min/max values in the output, i.e.
<tt>a=5;3:7;2:8</tt>,
worked, but empty values such as
<tt>a=5;3:7;2:8;;</tt>,
resulted in
<tt>ValueError: could not convert string to float: ''</tt>
on the Checkmk server.

This has been fixed.
