In Checkmk 1.6, when creating rules of the ruleset "JVM memory levels",
users have to choose between absolute or percentual memory levels. In
Checkmk 2.0, users can create both absolute and percentual memory levels,
independently of each other. During an update from 1.6 to 2.0, any user-
defined absolute levels were lost. Percentual levels were not affected.

This has been fixed.
