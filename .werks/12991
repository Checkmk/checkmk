Between werks 12871 and 12487 there was a feature competition. Users with
permission "Edit foreign (views/dashboards/reports)" (mostly admins) must be
able to edit and thus preview all those pages. However under normal use of
checkmk, the working user(also admin) wants to use/work with the page of highest
priority, which must be restricted to only pages that the user owns or are
published for all users.

Werk 12487 allowed admins to preview everything, but under normal operation,
views from other users would become their active working view. Werk 12871 fixed
that bringing the priority back, yet breaking the posibility to preview
everything from the editor. This werk brings both behaviors to work together.
