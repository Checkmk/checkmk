Fix proxmox backup time calculation

CMK-9277

The proxmox backup time now shows the timezone also.

This helps with handling correctly cases
where the CMK server is not in the same timezone
as proxmox server.
The backup start time is now displayed in proxmox
server timezone. This avoids a user confusion
between the age of the backup and backup start time.
