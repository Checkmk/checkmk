Before this werk it was not possible to add a "Temperature Zone N" graph to a
graph collection. There was no error message visible, it was simply not added
to the collection.

The function used to receive the graph definition was only expecting ascii
characters, although the graph definition contained a degree symbol.

Now a unicode compatible function is used to receive the graph definition.
