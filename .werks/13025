Before this werk it was possible that <tt>cmk --snmptranslate</tt> would crash
if the oids to translate where to long.

The oids where fed to snmptranslate as arguments and there is a limit for
the number of characters. If this limit was exceeded by too long oids, <tt>cmkd
--snmptranslate</tt> would stop without an error and needed to be killed.

With this fix the oids are fed to snmptranslate via stdin. This reduced the
time to process a walk with 137379 lines from 3 minutes 35 seconds to 2.4
seconds.

As the general speed is now much better, the status output was removed.
