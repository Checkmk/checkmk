When the db2 queries take longer than 10 seconds, the command is terminated.

Before this fix the termination did not work out as expected: Only the
currently running command was terminated, but the script was still running in
the background. This lead to a very confusing output: The output of the
terminated script was interleaved with the output of the remaining script. The
sections where mixed up and various other db2 checks crashed with strange error
messages.
