Before this Werk, both endpoints for downloading the agent binary and for
getting the configuration of a agent shared the same URL, so effectively only
the "show agent information" endpoint to show the configuration was active.

This endpoint did not work properly and returned an error:

<tt>AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'items'</tt>

With this Werk a second endpoint was introduced to download the agent binary
and the endpoint to show the agent configuration was fixed.
