The absolute levels for filesystem growth trends used to be Integer fields. This was changed to the Filesize field, to be more convenient when inserting larger warning levels.

Custom plugins which use the `size_trend` functions might need some minor adjustments since internally these levels are now handled as bytes instead of MB. If no custom plugins are used, no actions are necessary.
