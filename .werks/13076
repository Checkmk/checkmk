This Werk fixes a very severe data inconsistency problem in the REST API.

Previously, only the actual working code of the individual endpoints were
locked, but the validation logic which gets executed before the endpoints
didn't fall into that locking scope. This logic could then trigger a cache
load which could lead to data inconsistency and even data loss when using
the REST API highly concurrently.

The observed effects were:

 * when moving hosts concurrently, some hosts may disappear
 * when moving hosts concurrently, some hosts may end up in multiple folders
 * when editing hosts, spurious 421 or 401 responses could appear

The locks have now been modified to encompass also the validation logic.

This Werk fixes the afore mentioned problems.

There are no further actions to be taken.
