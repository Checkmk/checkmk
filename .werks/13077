The configuration option for the ETags, previously introduced in
Werk 11938 did not show up in the global configuration setup GUI.

This was due to a bug, which this Werk fixes. The ETag functionality can now
be turned on/off through the "Global settings > Site Management > REST API:
Use HTTP ETags for optimistic locking" configuration value.
