The memberType attribute on "collection properties" on "domain objects" is
now (as expected) "collection" and not "property" as before.

You may have to change your scripts if you rely on data in a "collection property".

The affected endpoints are:

 * Activate changes:
    - list activations
 * BI:
    - get BI packs
 * Folder:
    - all folder collections with hosts
 * Host Tag Group:
    - list host tag groups
 * Password:
    - list passwords
 * Time Periods:
    - list time periods
 * User Config:
    - list users
 * Contactgroups:
    - bulk create contact groups
    - bulk update contact groups
    - list contact groups
 * Hostgroups:
    - bulk create host groups
    - bulk update host groups
    - list host groups
 * Servicegroups:
    - bulk create service groups
    - bulk update service groups
    - list service groups
