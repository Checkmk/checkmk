This Werk fixes a bug which was introduced in Werk 13080.

When a site was used as "read-only", (or any other setup which allows
only access to Livestatus but doesn't have a config) setting downtimes
was not possible.

This Werk fixes this. Setting downtimes is now also possible:

* on sites with no configuration
* for hosts which have already been deleted in the configuration, but the change has not been activated yet.

No user intervention is necessary to make this work.
