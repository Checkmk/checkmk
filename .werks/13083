During the process of "activating changes" it was possible
in certain situations that the activation-ID would disappear before
the activation could have a chance to complete.

Investigations showed that a cleanup job removed these activations
before they even started. This could then manifest itself as the error:
"Missing Activation ID" or a response with a 404 status in the REST API.

This werk fixes this problem by changing the cleanup job to only consider
activations which are at least an hour (3600 seconds) old.

There are no further changes needed for this to take effect.
