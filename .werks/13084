In previous versions, the activation housekeeping job was
changed to a background-job running every minute because the
run sometimes took longer than 2 minutes (a hard timeout).

Due to race conditions this change led to errors (missing
activations) in some cases.
Only having it delete activations older than 1h however
led to exhaustion of disk-space in some cases.

This change reintroduces the previously dropped house-keeping
run right before the activation is started, while keeping
the periodically run house-keeping job to clean up afterwards.
