This werk fixes the disappearing attributes (e.g. locked_by, locked_attributes).

When editing hosts or folders through the REST API there could be a case, that
certain fields were not in the list of editable attributes. If a user attempted
to set this field (intrepreted as a "custom attribute") it would be treated as
a string. This would then lead to subsequent errors.

This werk also prevents internal attribute names to be used in "custom attributes".

While the fix is in effect immediately for all newly done REST API calls, if a previous
API call led to inconsistent data being stored in Checkmk, it may be neccessary to repeat
the API call which led to the error.

Ideally this would fix the error, though if this is not the case, contact us.
