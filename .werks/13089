Checkmk 1.6.0 introduced a small regression where log lines in cmc.log were
missing a space when logging with microseconds was enabled. Lines like

    2021-10-13 10:24:51696.318 [5] [core 12345] Foo bar happened.

should really read:

    2021-10-13 10:24:51 696.318 [5] [core 12345] Foo bar happened.

This has been fixed.
