Title: multipath: Fixed name handling of multipaths
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.8b1
Date: 1449145724
Class: fix

Old Versions of Check_MK added in some cases a whitespace at the end of the path name.
This has been fixed a while ago, but lead to the problem that the multipath check not longer
detected this paths. Now the check can handle again the old names. This means you can make an update
without to get an error, but you should do a rediscovery betimes to clean the thinks in the background (autochecks) up.

Please note that the Check_MK Discovery Service will detect the multipath devices again and it looks like they have the same name,
so do not wonder. It's cause of the autochecks.
