Some Livestatus columns had a wrong type when the CMC was used, and those
types were inconsistent with the corresponding Livestatus colulmns when the
Nagios Core was used. The CMC column types have been fixed now, in detail:

The "x_3d", "y_3d", "z_3d" columns of hosts have the correct type "double"
now, previously they were a "string".

The "last_command_check" column of the status table has type "time" now,
previously it was a "string".
