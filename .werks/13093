To protect against very long fields coming e.g. from notification plugins
and other external sources, the CMC will put limit to various fields which
are written to the monitoring history.  If such a field is too long, it's
simply truncated.  This is a simple protection against huge memory
consumption of the CMC, which caches log lines for faster views and SLA
computations.

Limits (non-configurable for now):

<ul>
<li>Comment: 2000 bytes</li>
<li>Plugin output: 1000 bytes</li>
<li>Long plugin output: 2000 bytes</li>
</ul>

Note: For fields coming from the Python side (i.e. notifications),
it's actually characters, not bytes.
