Various changes have been done to <tt>ValueSpec</tt> and its subclasses,
improving maintainability and robustness. If you don't write your own
complicated <tt>ValueSpec</tt> subclasses and you don't have any self-written
complicated check parameters, you are probably not affected.

<ul>
  <li>
    <tt>ValueSpec</tt>'s constructor doesn't accept any random unspecifed
    keyword arguments anymore. It is better to raise an exception at the
    incorrect call site than silently accepting every typo. To fix any problems
    with this change, just remove the offending keyword arguments, they served
    no purpose after all.
  </li>
  <li>
    <tt>ValueSpec.canonical_value()</tt> is an abstract method now, otherwise we
    force lots of places to handle <tt>None</tt>. Previously quite a few things
    worked only more or less by accident. If you implement your own
    <tt>ValueSpec</tt> subclass, you have to implement that method now, unless
    an intermediate class already does it for you.
  </li>
  <li>
    <tt>DropdownChoice</tt> and <tt>CascadingDropdown</tt> don't have a
    <tt>no_preselect</tt> keyword argument anymore. It was redundant, because
    <tt>no_preselect_title</tt> is enough: If this keyword argument is not
    <tt>None</tt>, <tt>no_preselect=True</tt> is implied. Previously one could
    specify nonsensical combinations of those arguments. To fix any problems
    with this change, just drop the <tt>no_preselect</tt> keyword argument.
  </li>
  <li>
    <tt>Alternative</tt>, <tt>UploadOrPasteTextFile</tt>, <tt>TextOrRegExp</tt>,
    and <tt>CAorCAChain</tt> don't have a <tt>style</tt> keyword argument
    anymore. It didn't serve any purpose since Checkmk 2.0. Just remove it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <tt>TimeofdayRanges</tt> has been removed, simply use
    <tt>ListOfTimeRanges</tt> instead. The former has been deprecated since
    Checkmk 1.6.
  </li>
</ul>
