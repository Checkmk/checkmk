When viewing combined graphs or graph collections, the refresh interval was
always 60 seconds without an option to modify.

The "Combined graphs" and "Graph collection" pages have now the "Display" menu
entry "Modify display options" to edit this setting for the current viewed
graphs.

Please note that this settings are currently not stored. So if you leave the
page and call it again, the refresh interval will be set to default of 60
seconds. You can use bookmarks if you visit certain combined graphs or graph
collections regularly.
