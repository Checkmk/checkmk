On Windows systems, the PostgreSQL agent plugin (<tt>mk_postgres</tt>) now looks
for the PostgreSQL binary <tt>psql.exe</tt> in additional places. Before, the
plugin only checked <tt>C:\Program Files\PostgreSQ\</tt>. Now, the plugin checks
<ul>
<li><tt>Program Files\PostgreSQL\</tt></li>
<li><tt>Program Files (x86)\PostgreSQL\</tt></li>
<li><tt>PostgreSQL\</tt></li>
</ul>
for every logical drive and uses the first found binary.

This means that the plugin might now run on systems it previously didn't run on.
Note that you first have to update the Checkmk agent of affected hosts.
