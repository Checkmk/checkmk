The check plugins <tt>sentry_pdu</tt> and <tt>raritan_pdu_plugs</tt> both
monitor the status of PDUs. In the discovery phase, both plugins store the
current states of the discovered PDUs. The subsequently computed check
results are based on a comparison of the discovered states with the current
states of the PDUs. Both plugins did not handle unknown states properly.

Furthermore, users have the option to explicitly configure target states for
the PDUs. In this case, the user-configured states are preferred over the
discovered states. This mechanism was broken for <tt>sentry_pdu</tt>.

Finally, when updating Checkmk from 1.6 to 2.0 and also during updates within
2.0, the states discovered by the plugin <tt>sentry_pdu</tt> were lost.

To fix these issues, users have to re-discover the corresponding services
"Plug ...". Note that for <tt>raritan_pdu_plugs</tt>, depending on the
current configuration, a re-discovery might not be necessary, but we
recommend it preemptively.
