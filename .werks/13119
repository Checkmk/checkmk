The interface checks compare the current state and speed of the interfaces to
the values which were found during the discovery phase (unless the user
explicitly configured a different behavior). However, in cluster mode, this
comparison is not useful because the discovered values correspond to a single
interface, whereas the the current values correspond to potentially multiple
interfaces. Therefore, with this werk, this comparison is removed.

Note that, as before, users still have the option to explicitly set the
expected state and speed, also in cluster mode.
