Before producing the <tt>ntp</tt> section, the linux agent checks if a corresponding
<tt>systemd<tt> service or a deamon under <tt>/etc/init.d/</tt> exits. Hence, on
systems without <tt>systemd<tt> and <tt>init.d</tt>, such as Slackware, the
<tt>ntp</tt> section was never produced.

The agent now additionally checks if <tt>/etc/rc.d/rc.ntpd</tt> is found and
executable. This re-enables the <tt>ntp</tt> section for example for Slackware.
