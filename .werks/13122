The agent bakery ruleset "Execute MRPE checks" allows for configuring the
remote execution of Nagios plugins. Previously, the service description
field was limited to letters, numbers, dashes, underscores, spaces and
dots. Now, any printable ASCII character except '~' is allowed. '~'
cannot be used because it would cause problems in cache file names.
