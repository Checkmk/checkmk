The ruleset "Systemd single services discovery" allows for configuring
the discovery of single systemd services. This ruleset has been slightly
reworked to improve its usability. However, users do not need to take
any immediate action, since current configurations will continue working.

In particular, it is not possible any more to configure empty conditions
on the systemd service descriptions, unit names or states. When editing
a previously configured rule with empty conditions, users must untick
these empty conditions in order to be able to save the changes. Also,
any regular expressions are now checked for validity before saving.

Furthermore, we have added a default restriction on the unit names. This
restriction excludes the volatile systemd services check-mk-agent@.service
used by the Checkmk agent from being discovered. These services appear and
disappaer frequently, constantly resulting in vanished and undiscovered
services. Therefore, they are never discovered, indepedently of the user
configuration. See also werk #12907.
