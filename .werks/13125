The new check plugin <tt>zertificon_mail_queues</tt> monitors the mail
queue lengths of Zertificon mail encryption appliances via SNMP. The
following seven queues are monitored (OIDs
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.8.1.100.{5-10, 17}):
<ul>
<li>Total Postfix queue</li>
<li>Incoming queue</li>
<li>Active queue</li>
<li>Deferred queue</li>
<li>Hold queue</li>
<li>Maildrop queue</li>
<li>Z1 Messenger queue</li>
</ul>
The check goes WARN / CRIT if the length of any of these queues exceeds
configurable levels. Per default, there are no upper levels.

This plugin is only available as an enforced service to avoid discovering
this service for non-Zertificon devices. This is necessary because
Zertificon appliances cannot be decisively identified based on their SNMP
data.
