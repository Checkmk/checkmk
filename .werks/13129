This is a regression since Werk #10429.

With Werk #10429, it was prevented that the Linux TGZ package overwrites
access rights of existing directories.

However, this fix only works for 1.6 releases, while unfortunately it does
not take effect in Checkmk 2.0 releases.

Therefore the desired behavior is supplied with this Werk.
