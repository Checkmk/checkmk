This Werk fixes a regression that was introduced with Checkmk 2.0.0. Only agent installations that need
to call agent plugins with a non-root user are affected.

When deploying custom files with the "Deploy custom files with agent" agent rule, one would
expect files placed under <tt>pkgname/lib/plugins/</tt> to be deployed as plugin files.

This only partially held true before, because files placed under the <tt>plugins</tt>
subfolder weren't recognized as actual plugins. While <tt>lib</tt> files are deployed
with a permissions of <tt>0640</tt>, plugin files are to be deployed with permissions
of <tt>0755</tt>, which was not done for custom deployed files.

However, as the executable flag of all custom files is maintained during deployment, the plugins
are (if placed as executable on the Checkmk site) still executable on the hosts, but
without being accessible to non-root users. Hence, it was not possible to use the agent rule
"Plugins, local checks and MRPE for non-root users" or other techniques that need to call
plugins with a non-root user in combination with custom deployed plugin files.

Files under <tt>pkgname/lib/plugins</tt> now are deployed permissions of <tt>0755</tt>,
regardless of the initial permissions when placed at the custom files directory on the site.
