This Werk fixes a regression that got introduced with Checkmk 2.0.0p18.

The changes from Werk #13131 lead to the situation that custom files placed
under <tt>~/var/check_mk/agents/custom/&lt;pkg&gt;/lib/plugins</tt> accidentally
got packaged directly under the Windows agent's installation directory.

Now, they get placed correctly under <tt>&lt;install_dir&gt;\plugins</tt>,
as it was the case before the regression.
