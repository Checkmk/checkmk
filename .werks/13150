In previous Checkmk versions fallback emails were sent in a predefined
plain text format. The content of these emails was not configurable.

Now, fallback notifications are sent either by the plugin ASCII Email
or HTML Email and can be configured accordingly. By default the plugin
ASCII Email is used.

The format of fallback emails can be configurede with the Global setting
"Fallback notification email format".
