If no DNS server is specified the error message "CRITICAL - Plugin timed out while executing system call" could have been reported.
The reason for this error is that the check_dns option "-s" is used with the hostname as DNS server. The host might not be a DNS server
and a timeout occurs.

The new option "Use default DNS server" will omit the option "-s" for check_dns. In this case the default DNS server of the checkmk server
will be used and no timeout occurs any more.
