When configuring the special agent Cisco Prime with its corresponding ruleset,
the change could not be activated. The following error message appeared after
attempting to activate the changes: "Error running automation call restart
(exit code 1), error: An error occurred: Error creating configuration:
'hostname'". This has been fixed.
