Wrongly configured update intervals on the <tt>Host statistics</tt> and
<tt>Service statistics</tt> dashlets lead to an increased CPU load on the
monitoring server over time. This configuration was applied when cloning
builtin dashboards that include these dashlets (e.g. <tt>Problem
dashboard</tt>. This has been fixed. The issue only affects Checkmk version
2.0. As a workaround, you can remove and readd the dashlets.
