In some circumstances, the NetApp API delivers XML data with invalid characters
to the special agent agent_netapp. This event caused the agent to throw an
error with the message "TypeError: cannot use a string pattern on a bytes-like
object". It stopped and could not write out any section. This has been fixed.
