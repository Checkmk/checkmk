Title: esx_vsphere_hostsystem_mem: added cluster check
Class: fix

Version: 2.1.0b1

The cluster check "esx_vsphere_hostsystem_mem_cluster" was configurable in
the enforced services and was working up until Checkmk version 1.6. This check
has been removed. Instead, the cluster functionality has been implemented and
consolidated with the standard check for memory utilization of ESX vSphere host
systems, "esx_vsphere_hostsystem_mem_usage". As a result, the ruleset
has also been consolidated. Please migrate any rules configured for the cluster
check "esx_vsphere_hostsystem_mem_cluster" to the new ruleset "Main memory
usage of ESX host system" to continue using it.
