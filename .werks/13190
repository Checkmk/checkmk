The veritas_vcs check determines the state of its service in the following
way:<br>
<br>
OK: All nodes are running<br>
OK: At least one node is online or running, others may be offline<br>
WARN: All nodes are offline<br>
CRIT: At least one node is faulted<br>
UNKNOWN: At least one node is unknown<br>
<br>
(Of course this can be configurable).<br>
<br>
The cluster functionality of this check did not adhere to these priorities to
determine the overall state of the clustered service. This has been fixed.
