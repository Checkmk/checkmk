This werk adds the following security headers:

LI:<tt>X-Frame-Options: sameorigin</tt> Only websites hosted on the same domain are allowed to include CMK as an frame. The <i>Content-Security-Policy</i> already constrains this.
LI:<tt>X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block</tt> Enables the browser buitin XSS protection.
LI:<tt>X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none</tt> We do not ship cross-domain policies so we disable them with this header.
LI:<tt>Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin</tt> Only send the origin as Referer to other sites.

You can overwrite these settings in the Apache config if you need to.
