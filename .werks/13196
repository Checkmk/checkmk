Passwords of local users were stored with SHA256-Crypt and 535000 rounds. Best
practice is bcrypt. Checkmk supports basic-auth and used to support Apache2.2.
Since bcrypt support was only added to Apache 2.4, SHA256-Crypt was used.

Apache 2.2 is no longer maintained and all supported operating systems come
with Apache 2.4. Therefore bcrypt is now used. The existing passwords will not
be modified or invalidated. They can still be read by Checkmk. Newly set
passwords via Web UI are now hashed with bcrypt.
