This werk only affects users using the Windows agent plugins
'windows_if.ps1' or 'wmic_if.bat' (bakery ruleset 'Network
interfaces on Windows') or the plugin 'mk_dhcp_enabled.bat'.

The above mentioned plugins have been restructured to improve
code maintainability. As a result, users need to update the
agents on Windows systems where one of these plugins is
installed.

The Windows interface check will go critical if these agents
are not updated. Furthermore, without an update, the data
produced by these plugins will not be processed by Checkmk.

In case interfaces are monitored using their aliases as items,
the interface checks on affected hosts might also report
"Item not found in monitoring data"
and go UNKNOWN. Updating the agent will fix this issue as
well.
