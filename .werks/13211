Title: Fix 'only from' monitoring in Check_MK services for systemd hosts

The <i>Check_MK</i> service did not report the <i>only-from</i>
configuration if the used super server was <tt>systemd</tt> and
the socket unit name did not start with 'check-mk-agent'.
This can either be the case if you are using the Checkmk <b>raw</b>
edition, or you have changed the agent package name via the WATO.

While the <i>only-from</i> setting was enforced correctly,
the agent did not report it back to the monitoring server.

If the agent reports back the effective <i>only-from</i>, the
monitoring server will compare it to the configured value,
and issues a WARNING if the allowed IP addresses deviate from
the expected ones.
