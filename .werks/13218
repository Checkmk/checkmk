A clustered service should only have the parameters from
rules matching the cluster host applied.
In Checkmk versions 1.6.0 to 2.0.0p11 however, the rules
configured for one certain node where applied as well,
with the rules matching the cluster taking precedence.

The wrongfully applied rules were the rules matching the
last node (according to the cluster definition) for which
the service in question had been discovered.
For instance for a cluster with the nodes <i>node_1</i>,
<i>node_2</i>, <i>node_3</i> configured, where the service
was discovered on <i>node_1</i> and <i>node_2</i>, the
service would have also been applied all rules matching
<i>node_2</i>.
