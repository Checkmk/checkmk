Title: Filesize unit labels

In various WATO rules the configurable file sizes have been
labeled wrongly. Labels read <i>KBytes</i>, <i>MBytes</i> and
so on (suggesting the 10 based units where 1 kB is 1000 bytes),
while internally the 2 based system had been used (where 1 KiB
corresponds to 1024 bytes).
This is now refleced by the use of the more appropriate labels
<i>KiB</i>, <i>MiB</i> and so forth.
Don't be alaramed: No values or computations are changed - only
the labelling is improved.
