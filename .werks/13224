This only affects plugin developers.

With this werk, changes to files in <tt>cmk/base/check_legacy_includes</tt> can now be included in MKPs.
The files in the sites <tt>local</tt> folder will be considered, and win over their shipped counterparts.

This has been made necessary to backport various comissioned features or bug fixes.

<b>Note:</b> This is, as the name suggests, all legacy code.
The <tt>check_legacy_includes</tt> and its contents are <b>deprecated</b> and we strongly advise against using it.
