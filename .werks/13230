Previously systemd services in the 'deactivating' state immediately led to a critical Checkmk service.
Now it is ok for any systemd service to be in this state once, or for a configured interval.

Note that this behaviour in particular affected users who monitored their hosts from
two Checkmk sites, as the <tt>check_mk_agent</tt> would be 'deactivating'
from time to time (which is expected).
