Recurring downtimes with option "same day of the month" are only handled by the
core for days 1-28 of month. The GUI will now validate the input for that
kind of downtime.

Please note that you have to revise existing recurring downtimes. Please change
the start date if it is currently 29, 30 or 31 day of month. Otherwise these downtimes
will be executed on day 28 in months without these days.
