If you used local plugins within
"~/local/lib/python3/cmk/base/plugins/agent_based/", the folder "__pycache__"
was always synchronized from the central to the remote site. This caused
problems if the timestamps of the plugins differed on central and remote site.
The remote site would than need a core restart on every activating of changes.
Therefore, this folder is not synched anymore.

Workaround was, to delete the files located within
"~/local/lib/python3/cmk/base/plugins/agent_based/" on the affected site, do a
dummy change for that site on the central site and activate changes again.
