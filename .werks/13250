If a LDAP connection used OpenLDAP and the attribute sync plugins "Contactgroup
Membership" and "Roles" were configured, the users did not get the roles and
groups assigned that they are member of.

These users should get their correct roles and groups with the next sync after
upgrade, so please be aware that there could be changes.
