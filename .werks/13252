netapp_api_vs_traffic used IO operation counter instead of time at some places which leads to PENDING
services if those values do not change over time leading to a non-computable IO rate (and thus raising
an exception).
This change makes netapp_api_vs_traffic handle that case returning '-' instead of a rate (but not becoming
PENDING any more).
