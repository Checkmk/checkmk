To avoid listing of all processes in the details of "State and count of processes" regardless of actually
reached levels defined for "Levels on CPU utilization of a single process" output will now only be generated

In case a full list of processes is desired, one should enable `process_info`, i.E."Enable per-process
details in long-output"
