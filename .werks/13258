The NetApp plugin now processes ports (and their associated link-status) of monitored interfaces and
takes provided failover information into account.

If any of a given virtual interface failover ports is not 'up' the `netapp_api_if` check now
returns CRIT if it's part of the home node, WARN otherwise.
