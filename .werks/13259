After updating to Checkmk 2.1 rules configured for "output loads of UPSs and PDUs" check in
Checkmk 2.0 and below would result in unhandled exceptions "KeyError (levels)" and error messages
in the configuration interface "The type must be a dictionary, but it is a tuple."
This change introduces a transform function for values of "ups_out_load" turning them into
valid format.
