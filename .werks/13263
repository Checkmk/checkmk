Current check_mailboxes active check implementation used only legacy authentication
for EWS mailboxes.

This werk introduces client/tenant based authentication, while keeping legacy authentication
still an option.

Please note that previously, when using legacy authentication, you could use the login
username as the email address for the mailbox you wanted to access. However, when using
ClientID/TenantID, you now need to specify the email address separately.

Please also note that this feature only applies to {{check_mailboxes}} for now.
