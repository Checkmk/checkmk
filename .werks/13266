Version: 2.1.0p27

A new authentication data format shared among check_mail* active checks was not properly handled
by check_mail and check_mail_loop argument generators, resulting in messages like
    WARNING: The stored password "('password', '<SOME_PASSWORD>')" used by service "<SERVICE-NAME>" on host "<HOST-NAME>" does not exist (anymore)

This change applies these missing changes to the command line generators as already done in v2.2.0+
