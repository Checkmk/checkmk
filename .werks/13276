Unpacking configuration snapshots on (slow) remote sites could take longer than 110 seconds and thus cause a timeout
exception stating <tt>Got invalid data...</tt>. There was a risk that a snapshot could only be half unpacked.
Pushing a snapshot during "Activate changes" or the "WATO service discovery" can now no longer run into a timeout.
