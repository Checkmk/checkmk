Fixed race condition which led to a missing monitoring core configuration.
If several components needed a new configuration at the same time, there was a chance that the configuration for the
core was lost.
If the core starts without configuration, it will be stopped again immediately.
Furthermore, the core remains deactivated in most cases, because it only receives a reload command, which does not include a restart.

The error occurred more often in scenarios where automatic service discovery, the DCD and manual ActivateChanges were used simultaneously.
