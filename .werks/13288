Title: Improve speed of activate changes by incremental activating changes

With this change the microcore and its helper processes are able to reuse parts of the previous configuration,
without compiling everything anew. Only actually changed hosts will be fully recompiled.
This can significantly reduce the waiting time for "Activate changes".
In addition, the workload during the compilation phase is also reduced, giving the monitoring core some room to breathe.

F+:
## Compilation time comparison using a demo config with 150k services ##

# Full compiliation of all hosts (default behaviour in all previous versions)
real   0m21.107s
user   2m10.626s
sys     0m2.581s

# Using new incremental activation
real    0m6.936s
user   0m24.366s
sys     0m1.492s
F-:


The incremental activation mechanism is used automatically when it is feasible.
Actions where hosts are changed (edit/add/remove/discovery) can make use of this new feature.
However, changes to rulesets require a complete recompilation of the entire configuration, just as in previous versions.
