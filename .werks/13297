Large installations with several thousand hosts/folders suffered from a decreased performance
when navigating through the folder hierarchy or when displaying rulesets.
Furthermore, the global settings option <tt>Hide folders without read permissions</tt> made the
entire setup system virtually unusable for non-admin users.
Some of the data is now cached via Redis, which reduces needless calculations and file parsing.
