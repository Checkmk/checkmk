In the previous version the BI special agent required the configuration lock to compute the aggregation status.
Long running processes, like the agent baking or host renaming, could hold the configuration lock for a considerable
amount of time, hereby cauing the BI special agent to run into a timeout.

With this change, the agent no longer needs a locked configuration to compute its data.
