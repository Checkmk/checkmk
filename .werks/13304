The GUI now fetches most of the data for the views using the json format instead of python.
Larger views in particular will benefit from this change, as parsing Python data takes
10-15 times longer than parsing the same amount of json data.
A view with 1000 rows roughly fetches 1MB of data.
<ul>
<li>Python parsing: 300ms</li>
<li>Json parsing: 25ms</li>
</ul>

Note: There are still other livestatus queries that use the old python format, but we will reduce them over time.
