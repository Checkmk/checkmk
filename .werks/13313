In distributed setups with sites using different Checkmk versions we can
not ensure that all versions are compatible with each other. To clarify
the compatibility between version we've now added more version checks that
ensure the central and remote sites are using compatible versions.

Allowed are connections:

<ul>
<li>Between same major versions (e.g. 2.0.0p1 to 2.0.0p3)</li>
<li>From previous to newer major version (e.g. 1.6.0 central to 2.0.0 remote site)</li>
</ul>

Disallowed are connections:

<ul>
<li>From pre-pre to new major version (e.g. 1.6.0 central to 2.1.0 remote site)</li>
<li>From new to old (e.g. 2.0.0p1 to 1.6.0p21)</li>
<li>Between CME and other editions</li>
</ul>
