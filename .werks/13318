To make packaging of special agents easier we now support the special agents
python modules to be located at <tt>local/lib/python3/cmk/special_agents</tt>.
This is analog to the shipped special agent path at
<tt>lib/python3/cmk/special_agents</tt>.

The modules from the new path can then be imported as usual: <tt>import
cmk.special_agent.your_name</tt>.
