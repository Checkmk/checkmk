For some time now, we have been recommending that, in the case of major updates
over several versions, the updates to the individual versions should be made in
stages, e.g. in the case of a migration from 1.5 to 2.0, the version 1.5 should
first be updated to 1.6 and then to 2.0.

Furthermore, <tt>omd update</tt> does support downgrades to older major
versions. However, a lot of manual adjustments are necessary to make the
configuration and runtime data of the site compatible to an older major version
again. So we don't recommend to do this step either.

This change now introduces a hard barrier in the <tt>omd update</tt> command,
which forces the above recommendations.

Examples:

<ul>
    <li>1.6 to 2.0 is allowed</li>
    <li>2.0 to 2.1 is allowed</li>
    <li>1.6 to 2.1 is blocked</li>
</ul>

You can disable this new check by using the <tt>omd -f update [site]</tt>
command. However, sites that have been updated this way will no longer be
supported by us.
