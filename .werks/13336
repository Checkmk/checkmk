This Bug affects users, if they created the rule <i>Setup > Services > Service monitoring
rules > Windows Services > New rule: Windows Services</i> with the following two properties:
LI: they added the option <i>Service states</i>
LI: they did not create any new elements within this option
Creating this rule caused services, which check the current state of a <i>Windows Service<\i> to
crash with the error <tt>UnboundLocalError: local variable 'this_state' referenced before assignment
<\tt>. The problem is alleviated if any of the two properties above are changed. This patch
eliminates the crash alltogether. The state of the service will now show <i>State if no entry
matches</i>, if this option is specified. Otherwise, it shows <i>CRIT</i>.

The previous version of <tt>services.py</tt> falsely assumed that if params contains the key 
"states", that the corresponding entry contains at least one element matching the service. However,
 this assumption is violated if ones species a rule without any elements. In this params["states"] 
is the empty list [].
