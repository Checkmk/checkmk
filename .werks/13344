The status of a pod with an erronous container will often change. This happens even if there is
no meaningful change in the underlying problem. Previously, the kube_pod_status check would alert
if a specific status would persist for too long. However, changes of status would reset the
corresponding timer. The new rule set allows configuring a timer for a group of statuses.
