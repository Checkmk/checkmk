The Windows agent plugin <tt>windows_if.ps1</tt>, deployed via the bakery
ruleset 'Network interfaces on Windows', collects additional data about
network interfaces, such as aliasses and MAC addresses. Up to now, the
plugin used <tt>Get-WmiObject Win32_NetworkAdapter</tt> to collect this
information. However, <tt>Win32_NetworkAdapter</tt> is deprecated and
might return wrong aliasses for certain network adapters.

Now, the plugin attempts to use <tt>Get-NetAdapter</tt> instead. If this
is not available, it falls back to <tt>Win32_NetworkAdapter</tt>.

For most interfaces, this change should be compatible, since
<tt>Win32_NetworkAdapter</tt> and <tt>Get-NetAdapter</tt> produce mostly
identical output. However, as mentioned earlier, there might be interfaces
for which e.g. the alias changes.
