By default, the Oracle agent plugin is supposed to always output all sections,
even if they are empty. This ensures a proper handling of unresponsive databases
and login failures on the Checkmk server. Only when explicitly requesting
sections via the command line (<tt>--sections ...</tt>), no empty sections are
produced. This behavior was broken and has been fixed.
