There were two bugs in the configuration of the special agent for IPMI sensors
via freeipmi: The flags "Sensor threshold" and "Suppress not available
sensors" were interchanged (i.e., activating one in the GUI activated
the other one on the command line). Furthermore, unticking a configuration
flag no effect, i.e., the corresponding command line argument was still
active.
