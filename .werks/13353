On some systems, the linux agent tried to set invalid localisation
settings. For example, when <tt>C.utf8</tt> is not available, but
<tt>es_EC.utf8</tt> is, the agent still tried to set <tt>C.utf8</tt>
as localisation, which resulted in the error
<tt>setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale</tt>.

Furthermore, in the rare case where the <tt>locale</tt> or the
<tt>inpath</tt> command were not available, no localisation was set.
These cases now default to <tt>LC_ALL=C</tt>.
