Since version 2.0.0, if disabled service rules with negated service condition were used, these
rules were wrongly converted with the next 2.0.0p update.
The negate condition was empty after updating, leading to missfunctional rules.

This also happens while updating from 1.6.0 to 2.0.0.

If you used such rules, you have to set the service condition with negate again.
