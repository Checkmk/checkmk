If a crash report can not be found any more, a note to the error message was
added, that this can be caused by the automatic cleanup job that found more
than 200 crash reports below ~/var/check_mk/crashes. The cleanup job has than
already deleted this report.

The report should be generated again if the related page is called again or the
next check interval for a related check is reached.
