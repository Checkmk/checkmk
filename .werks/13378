The detection of the HTTP protocol, used in "Analyze configuration", "Crash
reports" and to determine the shown default setting of "URL prefix for links to
Checkmk" for notifications, was broken since 2.0.0. That leaded e.g. to a
warning in section "Secure GUI (HTTP)" of "Analyze configuration", even if
https was configured.
