The Redis server log ~/var/log/redis-server.log could contain warning messages
for the number of maximum open files and the TCP backlog settings on startup.

The configuration has now been adjusted, so you should not get this messages any more.

Please note, that there could be still a overcommit_memory warning, especially
on our appliances. We will not change this OS setting for now.
