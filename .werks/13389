Two report related color properties took percentage values as input to define a color (from red,
green and blue). This is changed to the common format of rgb color codes ([0, 255]).
Changed properties:
<ul>
<li>Create/Edit report: Default table layout > Background shading for rows</li>
<li>Create new/Edit fixed element: Color</li>
</ul>
