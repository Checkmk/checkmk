In previous versions the mk_mongodb.py agent plugin printed expected exceptions
to stderr. This may confuse the user as they may think something is wrong with
the plugin or the mongodb server while this exception is totally fine.

For example mk_mongodb.py queries for replica information. Is a mongodb server
queried that has no replica configured, the plugin wrote an error message
to stderr that it could not fetch the replication Information.

These Errors are now hidden by default. They may be shown by specifying
<tt>-vv</tt> when executing the agent plugin manually.

The errors are logged with log level debug.
