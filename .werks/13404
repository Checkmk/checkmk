Before this change the discovery behaviour of the diskstat check was dependent
on the source of the data: When running an agent inside a docker container,
devices without counters where not discovered, when running the mk_docker.py
agent plugin those devices where discovered.

With this Werk devices without counters are no longer discovered with
mk_docker.py
