The rule "Number of threads" can set both relative and absolute levels for the
number of threads. Up until this Werk it was not possible to remove said levels
completely once they where set.

Now this is possible. For example you can define a base rule matching all hosts
to check for absolute levels and add another rule matching a single host
removing the absolute levels from the base rule and only check for relative
levels. To accomplish that choose "No levels" for the absolute levels on the
single host.
