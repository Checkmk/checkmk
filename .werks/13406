Before this werk the special agent <tt>agent_vsphere</tt> crashed when it was
executed while a virtual machine is cloned. The freshly cloned virtual machine
is not assigned to any vmware host, and thus can not be reporetd.

If a virtual machine is reported to have no vmware host, the virtual machine is
now ignored and a message is printed to stderr.
