After this werk it's possible to download the "vanilla" and "generic" agents via RESTAPI.

To download the "generic" agent you can use the following url:

/api/1.0/domain-types/agent/actions/download_by_host/invoke?agent_type=generic&os_type=linux_tgz

The url for downloading the agent by host name continue to work as is.
