The following error was shown after copying the "allservices" view into a
dashboard (create new dashboard; choose "Add" -> "Copy of existing view";
choose "allservices").

`Cannot load dashboards from /omd/sites/site/var/check_mk/web/cmkadmin/user_dashboards.mk: invalid syntax (<unknown>, line 1)`

The error was permanent, no dashboards could be viewed or edited. The error
could be resolved by removing a single <tt>l</tt> before a <tt>"</tt> from the
file mentioned in the error message.
