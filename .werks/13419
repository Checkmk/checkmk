Werk #13413 in version 2.0.0p22 caused that many valid
<tt>cisco_cpu_multiitem</tt> services vanished. This werk brings them back, but
in some cases with a different name: If your <tt>cisco_cpu_multiitem</tt> is
named <tt>CPU utilization 0</tt> those might vanish and be rediscovered as
<tt>CPU utilization 1</tt>.

Werk #13413 assumed that a 0 in cpmCPUTotalPhysicalIndex means that this CPU is
not supported at all. This assumption was wrong.
