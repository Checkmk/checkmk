apc_symmetra_elphase check would assume CRIT state for current values bigger then 1 A.
Since this value depends on the configuration of the UPS and the battery type, it
produced error states for normal current values.

If you want to keep using 1 A as a threshold value for apc_symmetra_elphase current
set it up in the check's parameters.
