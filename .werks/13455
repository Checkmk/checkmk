NetApp Qtree service had a name that consisted of quota and quota-users.
For some setups, the name wasn't unique, which led to some services not
being discovered.
To resolve the problem, volume is added to the service name. This however,
can lead to incompatibility. Your services will be discovered again by
a different name.
If you want to prevent the incompatibility and are sure that your setup
doesn't have clashing names, you can remove the volume from the service
name by enbling Service discovery rules > NetApp Qtree discovery >
Exclude volume from service name option.
