The data for the NTP service "NTP Time" and "NTP Peer"
had a cache validity intervall of 30 seconds, in order
to create a new data set every time the agent was triggered.
Unfortunately this meant that the data was expired, before
it ever reached the monitoring server.
This hack increases the validitiy of the data set to 120 seconds,
while still recreating it every time the agent is called.
