In the host configuration you can now configure "Additional IPv6 addresses" even if the "IP address family" is set to "IPv4" and vice versa.

The configured additional IP addresses can be used by active checks (such as ICMP ping).
They can be IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses, regardless whether the host is contacted by the monitoring backend via IPv4, IPv6 or both.

By making these options available independently of the IP address family, the behaviour of the GUI matches that of the REST API, which already allows this kind of configuration.
