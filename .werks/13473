In rare cases a `cmk-update-config` could silently drop the service of a plugin (see below for which plugins can be affected).
It would then appear as stale in the service view.
A rediscovery would fix the issue (and usually report one or more new services).

Now the affected service will go to UNKNOWN, and include "<missing an item>" in the service description.
However the required action remains the same: Perform a rediscovery.
It will now report the affected service as being vanished (and usually one or more new services).

This only affects services of (custom) plugins, whose implementation was changed:
From being a single service plugin ("without item") to being a multiple services plugin ("with item").
In the case a shipped plugin is changed in this regard, this scenario should be avoided by implementing an automatic transition.
For custom plugins however, you may encounter the described issue.
