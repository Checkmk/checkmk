The configuration setting "Name of agent packages (Linux, UNIX)" no longer affects the service units names <b>included</b> in the package.

This werk only affects users who have configured a non-standard package name for the Checkmk agent packages created by the agent bakery.

The option was originally implemented to allow for different DEB or RPM packages to be distributed by a local package repository without conflicting.

However, this parameter also changed the names of the created systemd, xinetd or inetd units.
This will no longer be the case.

While the previous behaviour <b>in theory</b> allowed you to deploy multiple agent versions on the same host, that was never supported and is highly discouraged.
Trying to do so lead to inconsistent or downright wrong monitoring data in the past.

With the introduction of the new component <tt>cmk-agent-ctl</tt> support for multiple agent versions would become even more error prone and expensive (both in development and in maintenance).
By fixing the services name we no longer suggest that this would be feasable.
