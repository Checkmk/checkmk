This werk only affects users who have implemented their own plugins for active checks or special agents (the ones commonly named <tt>checks/check_*</tt> and <tt>checks/agent_*</tt>).

The functions implemented in those plugins have to a accept the IP address of the host as an argument.
For hosts without an IP address they used to get passed <tt>"0.0.0.0"</tt> or <tt>"::0"</tt>.
This has been changed to `None`.
Since most of these functions simply pass it on in a list, this should not make any difference.
