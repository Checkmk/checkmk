The documentation of the check plugin <tt>juniper_fru</tt>, which
monitors the power supplies of Juniper Ethernet Switch Chassis,
incorrectly stated that an operational status of "present" results
in the monitoring status OK. However, "present" results in WARN,
which is correct and has been fixed in the documentation.
