The MTR agent plugin spawns multiple subprocesses (one per
target address). When running under systemd, these subprocesses
were terminated before they could produce MTR data. Therefore,
the MTR plugin can now only be deployed asynchronously via
the agent bakery. This allows these subprocesses to terminate
properly. Users have to update the agent on affected hosts.
