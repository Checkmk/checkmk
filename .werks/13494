Title: <tt>mongodb_counters</tt>: Fix "ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 3)"

Version: 2.1.0b1

In certain cases, the check plugin <tt>mongodb_counters</tt> crashed with
"ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 3)".

The reason for this crash is that depending on the version,
<tt>db.serverStatus().opcounters</tt> can contain a counter named
"deprecated", which does not follow the syntax of the other counters.
This counter is now skipped.
