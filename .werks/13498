If you wanted to permit a user to be able to share his customizations (views,
dashboards, topics, etc.) with other users of his contact groups, you
previously had to permit the user also to share his customziations with all
users.

All of the following permissions can now be set independent of each other:

1) Publish view
Make views visible and usable for all users.

2) Publish to allowed contact groups
Make views visible and usable for users of contact groups the publishing user
is a member of.

3) Publish to foreign contact groups.
Make views visible and usable for users of contact groups the publishing user
is not a member of.

This way you can e.g. allow a user only to share his dashboards with users who
are in the same contact group.
