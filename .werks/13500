Werk #13370 introduced the automatic setting of the customer user attribute on
LDAP synchronization. This Werk did not keep in mind the option to change the
customer attribute in the user setting, leading to the behaviour, that the
customer attribute of the LDAP connection is set on every LDAP synchronization,
overwriting existing changes.

From now on, the customer attribute will only be set once by the LDAP
synchronization on user creation.

Please check existing users after the update for correct customer settings.
