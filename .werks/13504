If you changed sitespecific settings for remote sites that depend on the "omd
config" command (like "Start during system boot", "Access to Livestatus via
TCP", etc.), the changes were not correctly applied on the effected remote
sites.

This behaviour affects at least all versions since 1.5.

If you change such settings now, the "Activate pending changes page" will show
the following warning for each effected site:
"The applied changes require a restart of all site services.
These are performed now and will cause a short offline period."

On activating changes, a background job will be started on the remote site to
change the choosen settings. This background job needs to stop and start the
site, what causes a short offline period on the remote site.
