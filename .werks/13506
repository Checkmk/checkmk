If you used the option "Encrypt data using TLS" for remote sites, the
connection could not be established, showing the error "Unhandled exception:
30s while reading data from socket. Received data:
{data.getbuffer().nbytes}/{size} bytes".

This affected all encrypted livestatus connections in the Raw Edition and the
connections in the Enterprise edition that did not use the Livestatus proxy
daemon.
