Since werk #13501, only LDAP connections are processed, the user has the user
attribute for.

In older versions of Checkmk only one LDAP connection was supported, setting
the user attribute "connector" to "ldap".
This attribute was later changed from "ldap" to "default", leading to failed
logins now, because no LDAP connection matches.

The problem will be fixed with this werk. A workaround was, to manually change
the user attribute of affected users from 'connector':'ldap' to
'connector':'default' in ~/var/check_mk/USERNAME/cached_profile.mk.
