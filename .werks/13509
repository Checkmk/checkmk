If a host was renamed on page "Properties of MYHOST" via "Hosts" - "Rename",
the renaming operation was not possible if any site in distributed environment
had pending changes.

This leaded to situations where no more renaming was possible, e.g. if remote sites
where continuous disabled.

From now on, only the central site and the site the renamed host is monitored
on must have no pending changes.
