The check plugin <tt>mcafee_av_client</tt>, which monitors the signature date
of McAfee AV clients on Windows hosts, crashed with
<tt>ValueError (time data u'search:' does not match format '%Y/%m/%d')</tt>
on some systems.

The reason for this was that the corresponding agent plugin (mcafee_av_client.bat)
delivered wrong data on these systems. For this fix to apply, you have to update
the agent on affected hosts.
