The Checkmk update procedure (<tt>cmk-update-config</tt>) now validates most of the configured
rules and logs "WARNING: Invalid rule configuration detected" in case of an error. If you
encounter such errors, your configuration contains rules that need to be corrected. We
recommend to open the affected rules in the GUI. Upon attempting to save them, any problematic
field will be highlighted.

Invalid rule values can for example originate from invalid regular expressions, which were
unfortunately still allowed in Python 2 but are forbidden in Python 3, see also
