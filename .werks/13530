While creating a cluster the configured data sources are checked against each
node. If they are not the same the cluster cannot be saved.

Previously only the tags IDs {{agent}} or {{snmp}} were checked. If for example a
node has the data source {{Checkmk agent}} then the cluster must have the same
datasource. Otherwise the error
{{The node NODENAME has datasources and 'agent' while the cluster has datasources and 'no-agent'.}}
was display.

Now auxilary tags are also involved which may be set through other tags or tag
groups, eg. the tag {{cmk-agent}} implicilty sets the auxilary tag {{tcp}}.
This auxilary tag may also be set through custom tags or tag groups.

Details:
The tags {{cmk-agent}}, {{all-agents}} and {{special-agents}} contain the
auxilary tag {{tcp}} and belong to the default tag group {{agent}}. During
validation the exact values {{all-agents}} and {{special-agents}} are checked
and after these {{tcp}} is taken into account. This behaviour is equivalent to
the decision which data sources are added to a host.

Regarding the tag group {{snmp_ds}} the validation checks the tag values
{{snmp-v1}}, {{snmp-v2}} and the auxilary tag {{snmp}}.
