For using password authentication, the Path to the pgpass file needs to be in
the third argument of the INSTANCE Parameter in postgres.cfg:
INSTANCE=/opt/cmk/etc/pgsql-12.env:checkmk:/var/lib/pgsql/12/data/.checkmk_pgpass

In pg_hba.conf, password authentication needs to be set for the checkmk user:
local all checkmk password

With these setting, the current version of the Plugin asks for the password of
the checkmk postgres user when it is executes manually.

The PGPASSFILE is read correctly from the config, and it may work on Windows,
but on Linux we are using "su -" to change to the postgres OS user and we are
loosing all environment variables which are set to the Popen function via
self.my_env.

This change will add the PGPASSFILE correctly after switching the user. This is
tested successfully on Linux with a PostgresSQL 12 DB.

It will also cause no issue when not using the password authentication, since
the variable is empty and is not used.
