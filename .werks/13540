In Checkmk 1.6 some plugins where discovered for management boards, but with
the regular host plugin name. If a host provides no data then the data from the
management board were used. In general this is very confusing and not right at
all.

With this change these services will go to UNKNOWN. Please rediscover the
affected hosts. You may lose the history of these services and your rules may
also have to be adapted.

Example:

An agent-based host has configured a SNMP management board. Then this host has
two data sources: the agent data source (host) and the SNMP management board.

After the host was discovered two uptime services were found: One service from
its own data source and the other one from the management board with the prefix
"Management Interface: ".

During checking if the host's data source does not provide any data for the
uptime service then the data of the management board is used for this service.
This results in two uptime services which process the same data.
