Via the command {{netsh dhcp server show mibinfo}} in the agent plugin
{{win_dhcp_pools.bat}} the collected statistics about free or used leases are
average and not absolute values. These average values refer to the last
execution interval, see also the official docs in {{DHCP Service POG.docx}}:

Task: Capture DHCP services scope usage statistics
<br>
Purpose
<br>
The following activity captures empirical data on DHCP service utilization.
This data, which is collected daily (or multiple times a day) should be
reviewed weekly. It will also be used to create monthly reports that are
reviewed quarterly for SLA/OLA compliance. Service utilization statistics are
different from system performance in that they measure the usage
characteristics of the DHCP service, not the underlying infrastructure such as
disk, memory, or processor.
<br>
Procedure Option 2: Capture DHCP services scope usage statistics using Netsh
command line utility
<br>
This collection should be performed on a consistent schedule, during key times
of the day, such as 08:00, 12:00, and 17:00. The information should be recorded
in a log file with the date appended to the name, such as
“DHCPScopeStats_200305.csv” (indicates a comma separated log for the month of
May 2003). Enterprise environments with many DHCP servers can adopt this option
into a parsing script feeding a SQL Server database.
<br>
1. Open a command shell by clicking the Start menu. Click Run, type cmd and click OK.
2. Type the netsh command: Netsh DHCP Server \\<servername> show mibinfo where
you replace <servername> with the name of an authorized DHCP server.
3. Open the month’s csv log using WordPad and manually record the data as follows:
<br>
“DATE TIME”,”DHCPServer Name”,”Scope IP”,”Total Addresses”,”IPs in Use”, “IPs Available”
<br>
For example:
<br>
05/24/2003 16:58:00.000,sea_dhcpsvr01,192.168.12.0,200,140,60
05/24/2003 16:59:00.000,sea_dhcpsvr02,192.168.13.0,200,10,190
