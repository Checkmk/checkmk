We now ship omd with the net-snmp lib in version 5.9.1.
This was motivated by several reasons:
* The previously used net-snmp lib had a bug in the python C binding which caused any higher auth protocol then SHA/MD5 not working. (e.g. SHA256, SHA512 etc.). This affected the inline SNMP mode in checkmk only.
* The net-snmp project had a long time no releases. So we now want to go for the latest release.
