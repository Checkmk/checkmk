Only identical consecutive messages will be filtered. 
As soon as a different message comes in between, the filter will be reset.

Example:
Without filtering
W Dec 14 14:32:56 0.10016 SOURCE Message_Itself 
W Dec 14 14:33:57 0.10016 SOURCE Message_Itself
W Dec 14 14:34:58 0.10016 SOURCE Message_Itself
W Dec 14 14:35:59 0.10016 SOURCE Message_Again
With filtering
W Dec 14 14:32:56 0.10016 SOURCE Message_Itself 
[the above message was repeated 2 times]
W Dec 14 14:35:59 0.10016 SOURCE Message_Again
