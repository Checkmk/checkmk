With the new option "Fetch certificate from server" in the global settings
"Trusted certificate authorities for SSL" and "Connection to remote agent bakery"
it is now possible to contact a host from the Checkmk server to retrieve CA
information.

To perform these actions a user needs the permission "Perform requests from the
Checkmk server". By default only the Role admin has this permission.

The mechanism to fetch the data is essentially the same as for the "Livestatus
encryption of host HOSTNAME" in the "Distributed monitoring".
