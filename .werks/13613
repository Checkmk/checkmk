Users with permission "Manage all scheduled reports", usually admins, can edit
scheduled reports. However, due to werk 12991, if the report itself is not
published for the user doing the edit, he will not find it and he will be unable
to edit it. This werk fixes that incompatibility as the admin user can edit the
report and its schedule. Still compatible with werk 12991, if the report is not
published to the user, he will not be able to schedule that report for himself.
He would first need to clone the report, or edit the report to publish it to
other users, both of which he can do as an admin.
