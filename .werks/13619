If you configured a dashboard with the object restriction "show information of a
single software package", that setting produced a misconfiguration of the
dashboard specification. When updating to checkmk 2.1 your site is unusable and
you can only see a crash report with the message:

TypeError ('NoneType' object is not iterable)

This werk fixes the crash, yet we still recommend to remove dashboards that use
that restriction.
