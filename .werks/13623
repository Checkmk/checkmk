With this werk 4 new default dashboards are added to Checkmk. These are:

* <b>Linux hosts</b>: A default dashboard to be used for a (smaller) group of Linux hosts, e.g. a cluster. You will find this dashboard in the "Overview" topic of the Monitor menu.
* <b>Windows hosts</b>: A default dashboard like the above but for windows hosts.
* <b>Single Linux host</b>: A host specific dashboard for Linux hosts. This dashboard is available through the context of a Linux host or though the link of the particular host in the overview dashboard.
* <b>Single Windows host</b>: A host specific dashboard like the above but for windows hosts.

You will find the group dashboards on Monitor > Overview and below the entry
"All hosts". Both dashboards are prefilterted to hosts with the according
operating system. But the scope is a smaller group of related host, e.g. a
cluster of linux or windows server. Because of that it is recommended, to add
more filters to get an actual overview of a specifc group of linux/windows
hosts.

The single host dashboards linked in the host name column, reachable through
the "Host information" dashlet of the group dashboard. Alternatively you
can reach them through the host overview itself by the "Host" dropdown at
the topic "Overview".
