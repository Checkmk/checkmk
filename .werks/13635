These Nagios plugins are not or at least rarely used by Checkmk customers.
Since Checkmk has own monitoring mechanism for Jolokia, MySQL and oracle we
don't need these plugins.

These plugins have been added to Checkmk in the early days of OMD and were not
maintained in our Checkmk packages anymore since years.

If you currently use these plugins in your environment, you may either switch
to the monitoring mechanism Checkmk offers or install the plugins on your own
to the <tt>local/lib/nagios/plugins</tt> directory of your site.
