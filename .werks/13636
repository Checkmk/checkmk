When trying to install Checkmk on SLES15 this failed, because the package
dependency 'xinetd' could not be provided by the official package repositories.
It is not possible to get xinetd from official SLES package repositories,
because it has been dropped in favour of systemd.

The switch to systemd is possible, if you can register regular services to the
systemd unit system and let systemd manage your units. But in our case, where
we have an xinetd process that is managed as part of an OMD site, this way will
not work.

Users were able to solve the situation locally by installing xinetd from 3rd
party sources, like for example OpenSUSE.org repositories. However, this
approach is not supported by SLES nor straight forward for users.

To make the installation more straight forward again, we now drop the xinetd
package dependency for all supported SLES distributions from our Checkmk
packages and ship xinetd together with Checkmk.
