When the crash report page displayed a agent based check report, it displayed
an error message "Internal error: Unsupported type <class 'bytes'>" in the
"Agent output" box.

The agent output can now be displayed again, even if it might not be 100%
correct in case there are characters included in the agent output which can not
be encoded in the default page encoding (UTF-8). This is OK, because the agent
output there is only for informational purposes. Users that want to have the
full and correct agent output can download the crash report archive and extract
the agent_output file from it.
