With Checkmk 2.1 we officially deprecate the component NSCA which has
traditionally been a part of Checkmk but was rarely used. In 2.1 it will work
as before and be removed with Checkmk 2.2.

With werk #6515 (https://checkmk.com/werk/6515) we have already removed the
libmcrypt dependency of NSCA from the Checkmk package dependencies to make
installation of Checkmk easier in regular cases. Now we want to clean up the
inconsistency that users might experience in case they try to use NSCA (missing
library). We also want to save the effort of maintaining the component and its
dependencies.

If you are a user of NSCA with Checkmk an alternative solution depends on your
specific use case. You could try to extend the Checkmk agent with local checks
(https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/localchecks.html), or with you own agent
plus. Or you could utilize the spool directory mechanism of the agent #16
(https://checkmk.com/werk/16). Executing Nagios compatible plugins with the
MRPE feature of the agent could also be useful
(https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/agent_linux.html#mrpe). Alternatively you
could also build NSCA on your own on the Checkmk server.

If you can't find a good replacement for your use case, please contact us via
your support contact.
