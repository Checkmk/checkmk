The rule export page of the Setup is needed to help users working with the new
rule related REST API endpoints.

To set the value of a rule using the REST API, you need to set the value_raw
field. The value of that field is individual for each rule set. To help you
understand what kind of data structure you need to provide, this rule export
mechanism is showing you the value you need to set for a given rule. The value
needs to be a string representation of a compatible Python data structure.

You can copy and use the data structure below in your REST API requests.

The previous export of the whole internal rule data structure was only relevant
for use with the now deprecated Web API and misleading when using the REST API.
For example the conditions field is represented differently for the REST API.
To get an idea of this data structure looks like, have a look at the REST API
documentation of the relevant endpoints.
