In the previous version, both the show user and show all users
endpoints did not behave as intended hiding the user attributes.
This werk changes this behaviour and also introduces proper field
definitions for the response schema. The response of the user
endpoint has also changed. Every attribute which was previously
returned under "extensions.attributes", will now be returned
directly under "extensions". You may have to change your scripts
accordingly. The affected endpoints are:

*/objects/user_config/user (get & put)
*/domain-types/user_config/collections/all (get & post)
