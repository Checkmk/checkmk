Until now, it was only possible to use SMS modems that support smstools.

With this werk a new notification option "SMS (using modem API)" was added as
notification method.

The script uses the API of IP modems, currenly supporting the model "Teltonika
TRB140" and outputs SMS in the same format as the notification method "SMS
(using smstools)".
