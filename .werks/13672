If a user views a ruleset page with rules containing predefined conditions the
user is not permitted for, a KeyError occurs.

The ruleset page will now show correctly such rules. If a user with no
permission for the used predefined condition edits such rule, the predefined
condition field will show a corresponding message that the user has no
permission for the choosen predefined condition.
