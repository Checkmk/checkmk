This fixes a regression that got introduced with Werk #13578.

While the above mentioned Werk fixed an issue with ignored security updates
for the "APT normal and security updates" plugin, it made a wrong assumption
to the output of the underlying <tt>apt-get</tt> command, that lead to a crash
for outputs that exactly consist of one security update item.
