It is now possible to prevent the Solaris .pkg package from the agent bakery
to install an inetd service on the target systems.

This can be configured by the agent rule "Checkmk agent network service (Solaris)",
that can be found at the "Generic options" agent rules section.

Sidenote: Alongside this change, the corresponding Linux-related rule "Checkmk agent network
service (Linux)" also moves to the "Generic options" section. This only affects
the presentation on the GUI and has no further consequences.
