The hardware/software-inventory plugin now uses some <tt>psrinfo</tt>
commands to determine information about physical CPUs,
cores, and virtual CPUs.

The previous method of parsing the output of <tt>prtpicl</tt> turned
out insufficient on some Solaris systems.

Furthermore, if some information is not available via <tt>psrinfo</tt>
(This may be the case for the number of cores), it will be left out
in the HW/SW inventory table instead of displaying a misleading <tt>0</tt>.

In order to apply the better detection, you have to redeploy the inventory
agent plugin to your Solaris hosts.

Checkmk 2.1 will continue to work with the old agent plugin, however, in
Checkmk 2.2, this compatibility will be dropped.
