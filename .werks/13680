Compression of baked agent packages is now turned off by default.

Recently, all agent packages got packaged with default compression options
of the respective packaging system. This resulted in a gzip-level-9-compression
of <tt>.rpm</tt>, <tt>.deb</tt>, and <tt>.tar.gz</tt> packages.
However, as all large files (larger than a few kb) that are shipped with Checkmk
are already precompressed, the influence to the package size was minimal, while
there was a noticeable impact to the baking performance.

Hence, the gzip compression is now deactivated by default (level set to 0),
while you can activate it with the agent ruleset "Agent bakery package compression"
