It's now possible to narrow down the target platforms (i.e., the operating system and
package format) for baked agent packages.

This can be configured by choosing the desired platforms at the "Select packages" entry of the
"Agent Bakery Packages" ruleset. Unselected packages will show the text "Not available" instead
of a download button in the baked packages overview. If no "Select packages" rule entry is
activated, the agent bakery defaults to bake for all platforms.

As the selection is done via a ruleset, it only influences the matching agent configurations,
rather than narrowing down the target platforms globally.
As a result, if you unselect all target platforms, the resulting agent configurations/packages
will vanish completely from the agent bakery.
Also, you can't narrow down the VANILLA packages with this rule. (However, they have a minimal
impact on the overall baking time, so there's no need to deactivate unneeded packages)

Note: To keep things together, the new "Agent Bakery Packages" ruleset is also used to
activate/deactivate agent package compression, which has been configured at the "Agent bakery
package compression" ruleset before. Your existing configurations are ported automatically.
