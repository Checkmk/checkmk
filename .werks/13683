When updating agents using the agent updater on Solaris, the postremove script
will try to remove the corresponding service line from <tt>/etc/services</tt>.
However, the script recently missed the fact that this usually is a symbolic
link to the actual services file, and overrode it with a new (hardlinked) file.

Moreover, this situation could lead to a missing Checkmk agent service, as the
situation got cleaned up on calls to <tt>pkg verify</tt> and <tt>pkg fix</tt>
by replacing the <tt>/etc/services</tt> file with the proper symbolic link
again, locking out the Checkmk agent.

This Werk is marked as incompatible, because some additional action might be
required to finally fix the state on your Solaris hosts. The uninstallation
script now preserves an existing symlink, but can't clean up an overridden
link. When setting the symlink back to its proper target manually while the
Checkmk agent is installed, be sure to paste the line containing
<tt>check-mk-agent</tt> to the target file in advance.
