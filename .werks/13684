Title: Agent Bakery: Minimize time locking the Checkmk configuration

Previously, the agent bakery (or more precisely: The background job
scheduling a call to the agent bakery) locked the Checkmk configuration
for the entire baking time.

This caused some other operations that need access to the configuration,
like sending notifications or changing global settings, to fail with the
following error message:

C+:
Couldn't lock the Checkmk configuration. Another
process is running that holds this lock. In order for you to be
able to perform the desired action, you have to wait until the
other process has finished. Please try again later.
C-:

Instead of querying the Checkmk configuration multiple times, the agent
bakery now gathers all needed configurations on startup while holding
a lock, and releases it prior to invoking the more time consuming
baking of agent packages.
