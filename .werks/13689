This werk changes the systemd or xinetd unit names of the agent
package.

Users of the packages created by the Agent Bakery (Enterprise
and Managed Service Edition only) are not affected.

Until now the xinetd service name had been <tt>check_mk</tt>,
and the systemd units names were <tt>check_mk@.service</tt>
<tt>check_km.socket</tt> and <tt>check_mk-async.service</tt>.

In all of these, the "<i>check_mk</i>" bit has been replaced
with "<i>check-mk-agent</i>", to be consistent with the baked
packages of the CEE/CME.

Upon update, an existing configuration file
<tt>/etc/xinetd.d/check_mk</tt> will be migrated, and/or the
new systemd unit files are deployed.

If you have customized you systemd units (for instance by
placing files to <tt>/etc/systemd/system/</tt>), you must
rename them accordingly!
