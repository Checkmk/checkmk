The Checkmk agent no longer uses systemd versions prior to 220.

These systemd versions either do not support features the agent may need
(e.g. setting of the REMOTE_ADDR environment variable) or they are buggy
(e.g. <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/1742">ExecStopPost</a>)

On theses systems, the agent will try to use xinetd.
