In case the linux agent is managed by systemd, the agent
updater now comes with dedicated systemd units to trigger
the update.

This was required by the new agent conroller architecture,
but it also has the advantage that the agent update is
triggered indenpendently from the monitoring data transport.

A misconfigured agent transport no longer locks you out of
the host.
