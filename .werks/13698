This Werk only affects users that used a <tt>.mk</tt> file to configure the variable <tt>agent_min_version</tt>.
It has never been configurable via <i>WATO</i>.

The configuration variable 'agent_min_version' does not have any effect anymore.
Setting the variable to an integer other than 0 (the default) lead to a crash, setting it to a string lead to unreliable behaviour.

If you want to check the version of the installed agent, please configure a rule in the ruleset <i>"Checkmk Agent installation auditing"</i>.
