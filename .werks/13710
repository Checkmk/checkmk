In case of unresponsive databases or login failures, the check plugin
<tt>oracle_instance</tt> went UNKNOWN and reported
"Item not found in monitoring data".

Instead, the plugin now goes CRIT and reports
"Database or necessary processes not running or login failed".
This also covers the case where a process which is needed to monitor
the databases is not running (e.g. <tt>ora_pmon</tt>).
