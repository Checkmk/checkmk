The service discovery in the GUI was not able to handle certain
non-ASCII characters in service names (non-ASCII characters with
Unicode code points larger than 255). Such characters were by
mistake replaced by other characaters. As a result, affected
services were continously displayed as unmonitored, even after
adding them to the list of monitored services.

Note that this issue did not affect the service discovery via the
command line (<tt>cmk -I</tt> / <tt>cmk -II</tt>).
