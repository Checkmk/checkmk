There was a bug in the command line arguments of the special agent for
querying IPMI sensors. The valid choices for the privilege level were
"user", "operator", "admin". These choices are valid for FreeIPMI, but
not for IPMItool, which accepts "callback", "user", "operator",
"administrator". Now, the valid choices for the privilege level depend
on the chosen tool, as described above.

Furthermore, the rule for configuring the special agent has been
adjusted accordingly. Previously, the privilege level was configurable
via free text input. Now, there is a dropdown menu with tool-dependent
choices. Rules with now invalid choices have to be corrected manually.
However, note that such rules anyway crashed the special agent
(independently of this werk).
