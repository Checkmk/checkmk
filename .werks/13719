In previous versions one could add text from foreign websites into reports.
<i>Paragraph of text fetched via HTTP(s)</i> The functionality was very
limited since no parsing was done. This functionality broke with version
2.0.0.

Additionally this could enable a malicious actor to retrieve sensitive
information from systems accessible to the Checkmk server (SSRF). Therefore the
functionality is removed.

Existing report elements of type <i>Paragraph of text fetched via HTTP(s)</i>
will be converted to <i>Paragraph of text</i> elements with text refering to
the URL. Unfortunately no macros will be resolved.
