When executing a datasource program like <tt>agent_vsphere</tt>
fails, then Check_MK used to output the complete command line
as plugin output of the Check_MK active check as part of an error
message. The commandline could contain passwords - however.  So this
has now been changed into just outputting the path to the executable
(e.g. <tt>/omd/sites/mysite/share/check_mk/agents/special/agent_vsphere</tt>).
