Previously a table in the HW/SW inventory tree could be opened as an own view
if
<ul>
<li>the view name was added to the related display hint (with suffix
"_of_host") and</li>
<li>the view was declared with "declare_invtable_view".</li>
</ul>

The view declaration function "declare_invtable_view" was removed. Thus you
also have to remove this function from your modules in order to avoid import
errors.

Moreover the view name does not have to end with "_of_host".

Example:

C+:
inventory_displayhints.update({
    ...
    ".software.packages:": {
        "title": _l("Software packages"),
        "icon": "packages",
        "view": "invswpac_of_host",
        "keyorder": ["name", "version", "arch", "package_type", "summary"],
    },
    ...
}

declare_invtable_view(
    "invswpac",             # view name
    ".software.packages:",  # legacy path
    _("Software package"),  # title singular
    _("Software packages"), # title plural
)
C-:

Now only the view name in the related display hint has to be stated.

C+:
inventory_displayhints.update({
    ...
    ".software.packages:": {
        "title": _l("Software packages"),
        "icon": "packages",
        "view": "invswpac",
        "keyorder": ["name", "version", "arch", "package_type", "summary"],
    },
    ...
}
C-:
