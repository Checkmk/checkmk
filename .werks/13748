In an environment with multiple sites on one server or with multiple CMK servers added as hosts, the
performance report was sometimes missing in the Support Diagnostics dump.
The reason was: When creating a Support Diagnostics dump, the hostname of the Checkmk server is determined using a Livestatus query.
The query previously used, returned multiple servers in some cases, and the first one listed was used.

This fix uses a new query that is more reliable.
