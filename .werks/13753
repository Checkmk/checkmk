Previously, it was possible to select a remote site in the Support Diagnostics UI, where the data was then copied from.
This worked in cases where the amount of data to be transferred was rather small. In other cases, it crashed regularly, or ran into timeouts, 
because the transfer took too long.

Now, the Support Diagnostics can only be collected from the local site. To collect data from a remote site, 
you have to enable the configuration via Setup on this site and log in locally.
