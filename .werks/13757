The ps (process) check on Linux was not able to handle processes with deleted
cgroups. Such processes result in crashes such as
"ValueError (invalid literal for int() with base 10: '...')"

The Linux ps check now handles such processes correctly. It appends "(deleted)"
to the cgroup of the process, as is done by the <tt>ps</tt> command.
