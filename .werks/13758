The check plugin <tt>ipmi_sensors</tt> crashed with
<tt>AttributeError ('NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith')</tt>
in case the IPMI datasource started to deliver incomplete data. This can
happen for example due to bugs in IPMI firmwares related to SDR caching.

With this werk, the corresponding services go stale instead of a crash.
