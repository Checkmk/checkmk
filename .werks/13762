In the option "Number of dropped bits or bytes per second", users can define absolute
or relative levels on this quantity. However, the option for absolute levels was missing
a title and was therefore displayed as "???" in the user interface.

Note that this fix only affects the user interface and has no impact on the corresponding
checking functionality.
