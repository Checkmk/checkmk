Werk <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/13474">13474</a> introduced the monitoring of agent plugins
and local checks via a dedicated check plugin (<tt>checkkmk_agent_plugins</tt>). This has been
reworked and extended in multiple ways:

<ul>
<li>The functionality has been integrated into the plugin <tt>checkmk_agent</tt> (service
"Check_MK Agent"). The corresponding configuration options have been integrated into the ruleset
"Checkmk Agent installation auditing".</li>
<li>Users can now configure separate version requirements for agent plugins and local checks.
Analogously, users can now configure two separate exclusion patterns.</li>
<li>In case minimum versions are configured, users can also configure the monitoring state for
unparsable versions. Previously, Checkmk always reported UNKNOWN in this case.</li>
<li>Checkmk now additionally checks for duplicate agent plugins and local checks (separately). In
case duplicate files are found, Checkmk reports WARN. This check respects any user-defined exclusion
patterns.</li>
</ul>
