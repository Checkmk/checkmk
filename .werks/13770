The cluster collector is considered healthy even if it never received data
from its node collectors. This behaviour was previously also reflected in the Cluster
Collector service, where processing was considered successful even though no data
was processed. This werk changes that, and the service will make a clear distinction
when no data has been received from the cluster collector endpoint.
