Add support for Google Cloud Platform (GCP). To enable GCP monitoring add
an agent rule for "Google Cloud Platform (GCP)". For each project you want
to monitor you need a service account with the "Viewer" role and a json
private key. One rule has to be created per project.

Monitored GCP services

- Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
