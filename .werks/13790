Previously, on a Kubernetes host Checkmk would create a single label of each

- cmk/container_image and

- cmk/container_name.

The label value was set to the name, respectively image, of one container. Since label keys
have to be unique, this would cause most containers to be left out, if there were multiple 
containers. This werk introduces removes the faulty labels.
