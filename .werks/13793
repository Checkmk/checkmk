You may find that some Nodes don't add resources to the overall workload your Cluster can handle.
This werk introduces a new option, which allows you to remove Nodes from aggregations on the Cluster
host based on their role. A node will be omitted, if any of the listed {role}s matches a label with
name 'node-role.kubernetes.io/{role}'.  This affects the following services: Memory resources, CPU
resources, Pod resources. Only Services on the Cluster host are affected.
By default, Nodes with role control-plane and infra are omitted.
