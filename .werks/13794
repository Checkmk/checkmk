The incompability of this change only affects users, who use the check API to write custom
Kubernetes checks. The sections kube_daemonset_strategy_v1, kube_deployment_strategy_v1 and
kube_statefulset_strategy_v1 have combined into the section kube_update_strategy_v1. The same
applies to the corresponding parsed sections. Moreover, the section models have been updated.
