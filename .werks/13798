Before, the Kubernetes special agent would crash with the message

[special_kube] Agent exited with code 1: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'partition'

The bug affected Kubernetes users who deployed StatefulSets and specified the UpdateStrategy
RollingUpdate, but no value for partition.  With this werk, the agent no longer crashes and the
partition value is set to 0.
