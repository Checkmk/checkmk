 With this werk, the service uses the Kubernetes API to report on the status of
 DaemonSets belonging to node collectors. For each node collector the following
 are reported

 - the number of Nodes with a Pod, which is available and desired

 - the number of Nodes, on which a Pod is desired

 The DaemonSets are identified by the labels "node-collector=machine-sections"
 and "node-collector=container-metrics". The service reports an OK state regardless of
 the data process outcome and the API data.
