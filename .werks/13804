This fix affects users who use Kubernetes host labels.

Previously, labels which are set by Kubernetes would be mapped one-to-one to Checkmk labels. This
would mean that setting labels in Kubernetes could overwrite Checkmk labels, which should not be
overwritten. For instance, setting the label <tt>cmk/os_family=something</tt> would incorrectly set the
corresponding Checkmk label to <tt>cmk/os_family:something</tt>.  With this werk, Checkmk labels are
prefixed with <tt>cmk/kubernetes/label/</tt>. For example, Checkmk now sets the aforementioned label to
<tt>cmk/kubernetes/label/cmk/os_family:something</tt>.

User-defined rules with old host labels need to be updated.
