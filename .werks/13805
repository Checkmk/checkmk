Title: No longer show dashboards specific to one host in a host menu

Previously, the host menu would show the following entries:

- Kubernetes Cluster

- Kubernetes Deployment

- Kubernetes StatefulSet

- Kubernetes DaemonSet

- Kubernetes Namespace

- Single Linux host

- Single Windows host

These dashboards are specific to the type of the underlying host. Therefore, the entry would lead
to a broken dashboard, whenever there was a mismatch between the host expected by the dashboard and
the host, to which the menu belongs. With this werk, the entries are no longer shown in the menu.
