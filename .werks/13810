This werk introduces the new monitoring solution for Kubernetes. It
includes a new special agent and a new set of agent based plugins.
The agent can be configured under the same Datasource Programs rule
within Checkmk. Monitoring services can be extended by deploying Checkmk's
collectors in the monitored Kubernetes cluster. For the detailed description
on how to deploy the collectors please refer to the following guide:
https://github.com/checkmk/checkmk_kube_agent/blob/main/README.rst

This werk introduces monitoring for the following Kubernetes objects:

* cluster
* nodes
* deployments
* pods

Other objects will follow in later werks.
