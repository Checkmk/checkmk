The check returned a 0 cpu usage value when the Kubernetes special
agent was polled too frequently. This werk fixes this behaviour
and returns the last reported usage value for a time interval of
60 seconds if no new data is available from the agent. If the last
reported value is older than 60 seconds than the usage value will
be omitted.
