The "WSUS (Windows Updates)" rulespec now enforces that both warning and critical levels have to be set.
Existing configurations will be migrated automatically.
If only a critical level have been set before, the warning level is set equal to the critical level.
If only a warning level is set, the critical level is set to 1000 times the warning level.

The checkplugin and rule for "Windows Updates" used to interpret a warn/crit level of 0 as do not check this.
Now you can explicitely set "No Levels".

The verbosity flag has been removed. If important updates are detected they are always shown in the service details.
