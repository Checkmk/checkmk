This werk extends the logwatch agent plugin with an option to filter out consecutive duplicate messages in the agent output.

If the option is enabled, identical consecutive messages will be filtered out.
As soon as a different message comes in between, the filter will be reset.

Example:

Without filtering:

Message_Itself

Message_Itself

Message_Itself

Message_Again

With filtering:

Message_Itself

[the above message was repeated 2 times]

Message_Again
