On linux hosts new installations now allow the unencrypted pulling
of agent data, just as the old agent did.
This is done to ease the installation process.

The <i>Check_MK Agent</tt> service will issue a warning until the
connections is secured by TLS, or the service is explicitly configured
to ignore the unencrypted connection.
