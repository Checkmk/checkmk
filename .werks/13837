For bonded interfaces a wrong MAC address has been reported in the interface
services and the hardware/software inventory. This has been fixed.

The reported MAC address is now the one that has been correctly displayed by
the <i>Bonding Interface &lt;name&gt;</i> service all along.

Since when looking at the hardware/software inventory we can no longer tell
which interfaces are bonded by the MAC address, we now add a dedicated field
for the bonds name.
