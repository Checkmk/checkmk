Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1410149976
Class: feature

The name of the services have changed. This change is required, because
a job in ORACLE is only unique with the owner.
New format: <tt>ORA</tt> <tt>SID.JOB_OWNER.JOB_NAME</tt> <tt>Job</tt>
Disabled jobs are no longer ignored at inventory. New rules are
added to configure the behaviour of disabled jobs and run duration.

A reinventory of all <i>ORACLE</i> <i>jobs</i> is required!
