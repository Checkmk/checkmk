The active discovery check <i>Check_MK Discovery</i> did not use cached data.
This could lead to lost logwatch messages.

Upon retriggering the <i>Check_MK Discovery</i> service, we now firstly trigger the <i>Check_MK</i> service (thereby updating the caches) and then run the <i>Check_MK Discovery</i> service on the cached data.
That way, we get the live information without loosing log messages.
