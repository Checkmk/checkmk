This werk changes the items and service names of the megaraid plugins.
Existing services will continue to produce correct results, but we encourage users to switch to the new services as soon as possible (see below for details).

Every service discovered by the megaraid plugins will now use the objects identifier as item.
In addition, the service names have been cleaned up.

For instance:

<ul>
<li><i>RAID Adapter/BBU 0</i> becomes <i>RAID BBU /c0</i></li>
<li><i>RAID Adapter/LDisk 0/1</i> becomes <i>RAID logical disk /c0/v1</i></li>
</ul>

Generally, physical disks connected via RAID controllers are identified by their controller, enclosure and slot.
The <tt>storcli</tt> command uses the abbreviations 'c', 'e' and 's', respectively.
However, in the previos version of the plugin, the controller index had been encoded in the first letter of the item:
The 'e' in the physical disks services referred to "the first controller", not to "enclosure".
The second controller has been marked 'f':

<ul>
<li><i>RAID Adapt/Enc/Sl e01/2</i> becomes <i>RAID physical disk /c0/e01/s02</i></li>
<li><i>RAID Adapt/Enc/Sl f03/4</i> becomes <i>RAID physical disk /c1/e03/s04</i></li>
</ul>

While the new item name (e.g. <i>/c0/e0/s1</i> instead of <i>e0/1</i>) will be used for all newly discovered servces, users that upgraded from an older Checkmk version need to enable the new service description using the global sestting "<i>Use new service descriptions</i>".
