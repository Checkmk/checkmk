Previously, custom action in MSI failed if the available Powershell was  
too old. Such failure made impossible the obtaining of the previously 
installed version of win-agent. For the use case <tt>update from 2.0 on 
2.1</tt>, this means lack of connection between agent and site, i.e. stop 
of the monitoring.

Since this release, the uninstaller custom action supports also 
Powershell 4.0 thus solving the problem.
