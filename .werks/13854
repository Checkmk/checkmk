Title: Agent bakery: Windows agent MSI is not signed anymore

Previously, provided by the WATO MSI file with Windows agent 
retained a digital code signature from the original MSI file. 
Because, in fact, the MSI file is a patched( rebuilt ) 
version of the original file from the distro, Windows 
considered this signature to be invalid. Having a wrong signature 
is worse than having no signature at all. Since we have currently 
no mechanism to sign MSI files in the bakery, we removed the 
signature completely from these files.

Since this release, WATO bakes agent's MSI using the unsigned 
version of the MSI file, thus solving the problem.
