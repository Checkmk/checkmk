In Windows names of a network card may contain a wide variety of the 
symbols including the pipe symbol. If the pipe symbol is presented in 
the name, then WATO crashes.

With this release, the windows_if.ps1 plugin replaces pipe symbol, i.e. 
'|' with slash symbol, i.e. '/', thus eliminating the problem.
