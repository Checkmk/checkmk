Previously, the Windows updates check crashed if, for 
some reason, windows updates service had been disabled. 
In this special case the windows_updates.vbs plugin 
sent specially formatted output which the check could 
not correctly process. 

Since this release, windows updates correctly process 
any output from windows_updates.vbs plugin and reports 
the error if it was presented thus eliminating the 
problem.
