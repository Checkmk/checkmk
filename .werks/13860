The change is intended to avoid the situation when the internal 
agent port is randomly 'stolen' breaking the monitoring. 
The former port 500001 is located  in the range 32768-65535 
and ports from the range  may be used(randomly) by TCP clients 
or even blocked by Windows(depends from version and service pack).
