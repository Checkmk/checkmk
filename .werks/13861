The following Fritz!Box check plugins have been reworked for consistency:
<ul>
<li><tt>fritz_conn</tt> does not display the uptime anymore. This is now handled by
a dedicated uptime service.</li>
<li><tt>fritz_config</tt> has been removed. The configuration values previously
displayed by this plugin are now shown in the HW/SW inventory.</li>
<li><tt>fritz_link</tt> now actually monitors the network link and goes critical if
either the link or the physical link are not up. The link type and the WAN access
type are now shown in the HW/SW inventory instead of in the output of this plugin.</li>
</ul>
These changes are incompatible. Users need to re-discover the services of
affected hosts.
