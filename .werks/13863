The activate check "Check HTML Form Submit" can now be configured to use TLS
without validating the server certificate. Previously, TLS could only be switched
on or off and the server certificate was always validated if TLS was activated.

Furthermore, if no port is configured, the active check now defaults to port 80
if TLS is deactivated and to port 443 if TLS activated. Previously, the default
was always port 80, regardless of the TLS configuration.
