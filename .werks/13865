Upon startup, the agent controller (<tt>cmk-agent-ctl</tt>) now checks if the
agent socket is operational on Unix systems. If not, we refuse the agent
registration (subcommands <tt>register</tt>, <tt>import</tt>), because a non-
operational socket can hint at <tt>xinetd</tt> systems. On such systems, a
successful registration would mislead the user into believing that the agent
communication is now TLS-encrypted, which is not the case.

Furthermore, the operational status of the agent socket is also reported by
the <tt>status</tt> subcommand.
