If you use the RobotMK extension package, you can now view and download RobotMK
HTML reports of RobotMK services.

Each RobotMK service will have an icon "RobotMK report of this service" in the
action menu, leading to the HTML report page.
This page contains a download option to download the shown report as *.tar.gz
file.

The content of the log files is fetched via livestatus and the logfiles within
~/local/share/addons/robotmk/HOSTNAME/SERVICE_DESCRIPTION.
