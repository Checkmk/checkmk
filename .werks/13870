Title: InfluxDB: Fix connection for remote sites

If you configured an InfluxDB connection for a remote site, this connection was
not used by the remote site.

The configuration for InfluxDB connections is now stored in
~/etc/check_mk/conf.d/wato instead of ~/etc/check_mk/conf.d/.

If you don't want to copy the file "influxdb_connections.mk" to the new location
on the central site, you would need to configure your connections again.
