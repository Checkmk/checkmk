If you use the RobotMK extension package (mkp), each RobotMK service will now
have an icon for the last log file and the last error log file in the action
menu of the service, depending on the service labels
"robotmk/html_last_log:yes" and "robotmk/html_last_error_log:yes".

These icons lead to a new page on which the respective file is displayed and
downloadable.

Please note:
You have to use at least version 1.2.9 of the extension package.
