A few columns which are actually available in the event console were not
available via Livestatus:
<ul>
<li>event_core_host</li>
<li>event_match_groups_syslog_application</li>
<li>event_orig_host</li>
</ul>
in the eventconsoleevents and eventconsolehistory tables.  These have been
added now for completeness, our GUI is not using them.
