Title: Fix command injection vulnerability
Knowledge: doc
Level: 2
Component: notifications
Class: security
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
State: unknown
Version: 1.6.0p29

Previously to this Werk an attacker who could control certain notification
variables such as <tt>NOTIFICATIONTYPE</tt> or <tt>HOSTNAME</tt> was able to
inject commands to the fall-back mail command. The commands were then executed
as site user.

With this werk the variable <tt>MAIL_COMMAND</tt> is no longer available in
notification scripts.

You can reduce the risk of exploitation with disabling the listening of the
notification spooler (the default is disabled) (CEE/CME only feature).

All maintained versions (>=1.6) are subject to this vulnerability. It is likely
that also previous versions were vulnerable.

To detect possible exploitation <tt>var/log/mknotifyd.log</tt> and
<tt>var/log/notify.log</tt> can be checked for special shell characters like
<tt>&&</tt> and odd quoting.
