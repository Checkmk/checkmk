Title: Secure path for OMD hooks
Class: security
Compatible: compat
Component: omd
Date: 1652079530
Edition: cre
Knowledge: doc
Level: 1
Version: 2.1.0

OMD executes several hooks to determine configuration options (e.g. which port
to use for the site apache). These hooks are version dependent, so OMD executed
these hooks via a symlink in the site to get the hooks matching the version of
the site.

The symlinks belong to the site user in order to be able to update
the version. Since a <i>OMD status</i> executes those hooks as root, it was
possible for a site user to create a malicious hook and execute code as root.

All maintained versions (>=1.6) are subject to this vulnerability. It is likely
that also previous versions were vulnerable.

CVE is CVE-2022-31258.
CVSS: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H 8.2
