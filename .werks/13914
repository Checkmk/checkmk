The "host & service history" view could not render plugin outputs
with semicolons correctly.  This is due to the fact that semicolons
are interpreted as field separators.

We now replace the ";" characters with their HTML encoding, that
is, "%3B".

Note that Nagios silently replaces semicolons with colons (":")
in that case.
