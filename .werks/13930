The response of the Rule object has been changed from singular to plural in some cases.

Concretely, the following fields have been changed:

 * host_tag -> host_tags
 * host_label -> host_labels
 * service_label -> service_labels

If you use statically typed language, you may have to recompile your auto generated API client.
