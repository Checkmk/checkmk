The REST API now has endpoints for querying metric data.
They are analogous to the Web API endpoint.
If you have any calls to ".../cmk/check_mk/webapi.py?action=get_graph...",
please use the REST endpoints ("/domain-types/metric/actions/*/invoke") instead.

Please note that the request and response schemas differ from the Web API and
any client code should be adjusted accordingly.
Further details about the schemas can be found in the documentation of respective
endpoints.
