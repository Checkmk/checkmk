The POST method of the "/domain-types/user_config/collections/all" endpoint
has been extended to allow you to create users with custom attributes.
Please note that the attributes must have been already defined by other means
such as the GUI.
Due to technical limitations, the ReDoc/Swagger documentation won't show custom
attributes in neither the schema nor the examples.
