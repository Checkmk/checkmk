Having a host configured with an unknown site would return a 500 status code error on endpoints such as "/domain-types/host_config/collections/all".
This is common in a distributed monitoring environment.
Instead the site field under the "extensions" and "attributes" key will now return the site id prefixed with "Unknown Site:".
This matches the behaviour of the GUI.
