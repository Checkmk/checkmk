Using various filters of the 'list rules' endpoint (GET '/domain-types/ruleset/collections/all') had
no effect on the result.
This is no longer the case.
With this fix, the originally intended default behavior of the parameter such as 'used' and 'deprecated' are now
respected and the endpoint returns only used rules unless specified otherwise.
