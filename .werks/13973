Putting a service into downtime using the REST API required permissions to access the corresponding host in the REST API.
The REST API call would fail with an error message stating that,
C+:
Host 'myhost' exists, but is not monitored. Activate the configuration?
C-:
This behaviour doesn't match the GUI's and is now no longer the case.
