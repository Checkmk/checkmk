The documentation text of the "deprecated" filter option in the 'list rulesets' endpoint incorrectly stated that
it will include deprecated rules in the results.
Instead it only shows deprecated rules, no non-deprecated rules.
The documentation has been updated in order to reflect the current and correct behaviour.
