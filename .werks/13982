Title: Reading host_config's will now honour contact groups
Class: security
Compatible: compat
Component: rest-api

Edition: cre
Knowledge: doc
Level: 1
Version: 2.3.0b1

Prior to this Werk it was possible for a user to read a hosts configuration
(using GET on `/objects/host_config/<host_name>`) even if that user was not
in the contact group of that host.

The REST-API will correctly check a users permissions before serving a response
in that case and report a 403 error if the user cannot access the host's config.
