The 'list hosts' endpoint (GET on '/domain-types/host_config/collections/all') will now
only list hosts a user can see.
If you e.g. assign hosts to contact groups, a user will only get hosts listed they share a contact group with.
The permission to access the root folder is therefore no longer needed to this endpoint.
