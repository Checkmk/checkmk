The timesyncd check plugin was unable to handle offsets that were displayed
with units other than seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds.
For example, an offset such as 5h 10min 12s would produce an error.
This incompleteness in the check plugin is now fixed and all the units systemd.time is
able to produce at the time of writing this werk can be handled effectively.
