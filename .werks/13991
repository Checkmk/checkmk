The check plugin palo_alto used to be purely informative, i.e. the status
of the service was always ok. Ha mode, ha local state and ha peer state are
now checked to produce regular monitoring states with user-configurable values.

In case, the HA mode is disabled, the local and peer state are always OK
and only the HA mode is checked.
