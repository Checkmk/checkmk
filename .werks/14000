In some cases, the plugin <tt>mk_oracle.ps1</tt> may deliver empty
async sections. This is possible in a situation when the async process,
which delivers the data for async sections, is terminated(e.g. due to a
crash or killed by Agent due to timeout), but PID of this async process
is reused by Windows for some another unrelated process.

Since this release, mk_oracle.ps1 performs an additional checking of
the PID of the async process, thus eliminating the problem.
