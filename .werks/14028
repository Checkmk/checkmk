Checkmk now parsed the time a service has been in the activating/deactivating/reloading state from the status output of systemd.
Correct parsing of the status information will only work after an agent update.
Previous verions guessed this time based on the past state that was observed.

Default parameters for warning and crit levels have been removed for activating services.
So a systemd service can be indefinitely in an activating state.
