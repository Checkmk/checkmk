Previously, when monitoring multiple IP addresses with an ICMP check,
results for all addresses would be shown in one service.
In case of many IP addresses, the user wouldn't have a good overview
over availability of a particular address.

Enabling option Setup -> Services -> HTTP, TCP, Email, ... ->
Check hosts with PING (ICMP Echo Request) -> Multiple services ->
Create a service for every pinged IP address creates one service
per IP address.
