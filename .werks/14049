It was possible to disable agent controller in agent bakery for Windows.
Now, it's also possible for the Linux distributions.

Disabling the agent controller is not advised unless you experience
problems with it. In this case, the agent will work in legacy pull mode.
Please note: In the legacy pull mode, the transported data is not encrypted.

If you created a "Windows agent controller" rule previously in on one of
2.1.0b versions, you will have to create two new rules, Setup -> Agents ->
Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX -> Agent rules -> Windows agent controller troubleshooting
and Setup -> Agents -> Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX -> Agent rules -> Agent controller
to get the same behavior.
