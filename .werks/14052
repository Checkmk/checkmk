It is now possible to monitor PDU on Servertech v4 devices.

The change is incompatible for users who have sentry_pdu services:
discovery parameter is removed and the output of the parse function
has changed. To get the correct service output, rerun the discovery.
The behavior of sentry_pdu check hasn't changed.
