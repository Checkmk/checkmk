This werk is only incompatible for users who had both 'Only check during the following
times of the day' and timespecific parameters configured in the same rule.

After the introduction of 'Enable timespecific parameters', the 'Only check during the
following times of the day' (timeofday) parameter became obsolete.
With this werk, it's removed from the UI and the existing parameters are transformed
to be timespecific parameters.

If you had a combination of timeofday and timespecific parameters, your parameters
are migrated in the following way:
<ul>
<li>If you've configured the timeofday parameter as the default when no time period matches,
the timeofday parameter is converted to a time period, and your default configuration is used
for this time period.</li>
<li>If you've configured the timeofday parameter within a time period, the time period is
assumed to be the correct time period during which the corresponding thresholds should be
applied, and the timeofday parameter is removed.</li>
</ul>

If this migration isn't correct for your example, please fix your fileinfo
configuration.
