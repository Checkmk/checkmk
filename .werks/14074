When registering at a site, the agent controller (<tt>cmk-agent-ctl</tt>) needs to
know the port at which the site is reachable. If not explicitly passed via the
command line, the controller tries to query this port from the REST API of the site.

Up to now, the controller only attempted to contact the REST API via <tt>http</tt>.
Now, the controller tries both <tt>http</tt> and <tt>https</tt> and only fails if
neither of the two suceeded.
