This werk only affects users of NagVis Geomaps.

One of the available map types in NagVis are Geomaps, which show geographical locations.
For this map type, NagVis offers the option to use geographical coordinates stored in
Checkmk host attributes, see http://docs.nagvis.org/1.9/en_US/geomap.html.

The necessary host attributes (latitude and longitude) are by default not available in
Checkmk. Therefore, up to now, Checkmk came with the script
<tt>share/doc/check_mk/treasures/wato_geo_fields.py</tt>,
which added these host attributes.

As of this werk, <tt>wato_geo_fields.py</tt> is deprecated, since it is incompatible
with Checkmk 2.1. Attempting to use this script in version 2.1 will fail, meaning that
latitude and longitude will no longer available in the user interface. Furthermore, the
REST API will respond with HTTP 500 when attempting to query the status of affected
hosts.

To retain the functionality previously offered by this script, users can instead create
two regular custom host attributes. This is fully compatible and will not result in any
loss of data. The exact procedure is described here:
https://kb.checkmk.com/display/KB/Geo+coordinates+from+Checkmk+in+NagVis+maps.
After creating the custom attributes, users must remove their local copy of
<tt>wato_geo_fields.py</tt> from <tt>local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/wato/<tt>.
