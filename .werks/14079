There were some user permission issues with the agent registration (<tt>cmk-agent-ctl
register ...</tt>). For example, the registration crashed with "500 Internal Server
Error" for users without the permission "Write access to all hosts and folders".

To register a host, users need the following permissions:
<ul>
<li>Agent pairing.</li>
<li>Read access to the host, either via "Read access to all hosts and folders" or via
via contact groups.</li>
<li>Write access to the host, either via "Write access to all hosts and folders" or via
"Modify existing hosts" and write access to the specific host via contact groups.</li>
</ul>
