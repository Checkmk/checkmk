This werk only affects users and maintainers of custom hardware/software inventory plugins.

The old API for the plugins residing in <tt>{local/,}share/check_mk/inventory</tt> will be removed in Checkmk version 2.2.
Plugins in that folder will be ignored starting with 2.2.
However, they keep working with the 2.1 for the transition period.

As of Checkmk version 2.1 plugins in that folder will generate a warning on the commandline and result in an <i>"Analyze Configuration"</i> test going to {{WARN}}.

If you maintian such plugins, please migrate them to the new API before upgrading to Checkmk 2.2.
New plugins live in <tt>lib/check_mk/base/plugins/agent_based/</tt>.
You can find an example for a migration on github <a href="https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk/commit/0264b6acdef677ff7ae323a696ddbe17d41116fc">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk/commit/e926cc58adb8297030fb03d61c7854a96311e7fb">here</a>.
Also refer to the APIs documentation found in your site (Help -> Check plugin API reference).
