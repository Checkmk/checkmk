Title: Fix privilege escalation vulnerability
Class: security
Compatible: compat
Component: checks
Date: 1652351997
Edition: cre
Knowledge: doc
Level: 2
Version: 2.2.0i1

Previously to this Werk an attacker who could become a site user could replace the sites <tt>bin/unixcat</tt> by a custom executable.
The Checkmk agent would then run it as root.

With this Werk the agent now always calls one of the shipped <tt>unixcat</tt>s below <tt>/omd/versions/</tt>.

All maintained versions (>=1.6) are subject to this vulnerability. It is likely that also previous versions were vulnerable.

To check against possible exploitation make sure that the sites directory <tt>~MySite/bin</tt> points to <tt>/omd/versions/MySitesVersion/bin<tt>.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H 8.2

CVE will be added here later
