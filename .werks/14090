This fixes a regression in Checkmk versions 2.0.0 - 2.0.0p25.
Enforced services on a cluster would go to UNKNOWN if the corresponding services were not additionally configured to be clustered on at least one node.

This werk restores the original behaviour, where in such cases the data of <b>all</b> nodes is passed to the clustered service.
