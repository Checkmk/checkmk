The following change only affects the discovery of the <tt>df</tt> check plugin.
All other "<i>Filesystem</i>" services are not affected.

The service discovery of the <tt>df</tt> plugin no longer respects rules configured using the "<i>Filesystem grouping patterns</i"<  ruleset.
The discovery of the <tt>df</tt> plugin can also be configured by the ruleset "<i>Filesystem discovery</i>", which now supports the configuration of those grouping patterns.
If you configured such grouping patterns for the <tt>df</tt> check, you have to add the corresponding options to the ruleset "<i>Filesystem discovery</i>".

<b>Note:</b> For the "<i>Filesystem grouping patterns</i>" ruleset all matching rules were applied, whereas rules of the ruleset "<i>Filesystem discovery</i>" are merged.
This means that now only the grouping patterns of the first matching rule are applied for each host.
We appreciate this incompatibility is an inconvenience, but is is necessary to be able to move forward.
