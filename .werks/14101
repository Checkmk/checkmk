With Checkmk 2.1 we introduce the new option to configure InfluxDB connections.
With this option you are able to send metrics directly from Checkmk to the
REST-API of InfluxDB.

More information on how to configure the connection can be found here:
https://docs.checkmk.com/master/en/metrics_exporter.html

Please note:
The integration is only compatible with InfluxDB 2.0 or later.
If you're using InfluxDB <= 1.8 you need to use the option "Send metrics to
Graphite" as described in the Checkmk docs.
