If you used report options in the "Add to" menu of views, an error like "Cannot
load reports from /omd/sites/beta/var/check_mk/web/USER/user_reports.mk:
invalid syntax (<unknown>, line 1)" occured.

If you still see this error while opening views or reports, you have to edit
the file /omd/sites/beta/var/check_mk/web/USER/user_reports.mk and change all
occurrences of entries like {'title': l'MY_TITLE'} to {"title: 'MY_TITLE'}.

Another option is to simply delete the file, but your saved options will be
lost.
