By default, Checkmk does not import Kubernetes annotations. With this werk,
this bevaviour can be configured via the option <tt>Import annotations as host
labels<\tt> in the rule <tt>Kubernetes<\tt>. The option allows importing any
Kubernetes annotation that is a valid Kubernetes label. These imported
annotations are added as host labels to their respective piggyback host using
the syntax <tt>cmk/kubernetes/annotation/{key}:{value}<\tt>. You can further
restrict the imported annotations by specifying a pattern which Checkmk
searches for in the key of the annotation.
