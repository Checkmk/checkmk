With this werk, the agent verifies whether the Kubernetes version is supported by Checkmk. If it is
known that an API server with a certain version is incompatible, the agent will now provide a
helpful error message.  Different flavors of Kubernetes are not verified. In the event, that the
version of the API server deviates from the versioning scheme used by Kubernetes, processing the API
data is still attempted on a best effort basis. Errors related to unknown versioning schemes can be
inspected by increasing the verbosity of the agent via the command line (you can find the command
line tool by using cmk -D).
