Previously, if the option 'Cluster resource aggregation' was used to exclude
Nodes based on their roles, the performed search would be a prefix search. This
was inconsistent with the inline help, which promises an infix search. With
this werk, an infix search is now performed by the agent. Those users who have
configured the option 'Cluster resource aggregation' to be sensitive to the
type of regex matching performed need to verify that the agent is still
performing as expected.
