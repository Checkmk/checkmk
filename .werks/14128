Previously, if the option 'Monitor namespace' was used to filter namespaces,
the performed search would be a prefix search. This was inconsistent with the
inline help, which promises a complete search. With this werk, an infix search
is now performed by the agent. Those users who have configured the option
'Monitor namespaces' to be sensitive to the type of regex matching performed
need to verify that the agent is still performing as expected.
