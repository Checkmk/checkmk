Previously, if the option 'Monitor namespace' was used to filter namespaces, the performed search
would be a prefix search. This was inconsistent with the inline help, which promises a complete
search. With this werk, an infix search is now performed by the agent, which is the default in
Checkmk. Those users who have configured the option 'Monitor namespaces' to be sensitive to the
type of regex matching performed need to verify that the agent is still performing as expected.
