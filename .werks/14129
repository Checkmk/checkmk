Previously, if the option 'Interpretation of pod status' was used to assign a
Pod to a group, the performed search would be a prefix search. This was
inconsistent with the inline help, which promises an infix search. With this
werk, an infix search is now performed by the agent. Those users who have
configured the option 'Interpretation of pod status' to be sensitive to the
type of regex matching performed need to verify that the agent is still
performing as expected.
