Previously, the parameter <tt>DNS Server</tt> of <tt>Check DNS
service</tt> rule was broken.  The options <tt>this host</tt> and
<tt>default DNS Server</tt> would both do the same: They would use the
default DNS server(s) specified inside of /etc/resolve.conf.  With this
werk, the option <tt>this host</tt> now (again) will use the address of
the host on which the service is generated. Secondly, the rule has been
reworked to be more concise.

Intervention is necessary if

<ul>
<li>you have explicitely set the DNS Server to <tt>this host</tt> and</li>
<li>want your site to operate in the same fashion as before.</li>
</ul>

In this case, you can set the option <tt>DNS Server</tt> to <tt>Use the default DNS server(s)
specified in /etc/resolv.conf</tt>.
