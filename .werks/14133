Previously, the networking information of a Kubernetes Node was found under Software > Applications
> Kubernetes > Network. With this werk, the information is in the path Networking > Kubernetes.
The old entries remain in the inventory history. This more consistent in how the information is
generally organized. Users which have included the path in their automation tools (including Checkmk
rules) need to change the path accordingly.
