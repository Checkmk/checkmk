The Kemp LoadMaster may provide multiple server states for the same Real Server, each state
corresponding to a virtual service. Previously, the check kemp_loadmaster_realserver would
incorrectly assume that these states do not differ across different virtual services. With this
werk, each service will display all of connected Real server states.
