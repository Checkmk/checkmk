When reloading the "Edit role" view after restarting Apache
certain sections and all of the permissions disappeared.
Reloading again usually caused them to reappear.

If the respective permissions are configured the following sections were affected:
<ul>
<li>Bookmark lists
<li>Custom graphs
<li>Custom sidebar elements
<li>Forecast graphs
<li>Graph collections
<li>Graph tunings
<li>Service Level Agreements
<li>Topics
</ul>

Now the permissions are always correctly displayed.
