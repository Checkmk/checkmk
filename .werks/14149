Using Clustered services with predefined cluster mode certain services would crash
if no summary (therefore only notice) was available for a node result.

This issue occured for many check plugins but the known ones were:
<ul>
<li>apache_status
<li>fileinfo_groups
<li>if64
<li>mrpe
<li>ntp_time
</ul>

This issue is solved and the correct information is now displayed.
