This hook can be used by custom plugins to further modify the snapshot content for the remote site.
The registered function gets the site_snapshot_settings as argument.

F+:
site_snapshot_settings: Dict[SiteId, SnapshotSettings]

SnapshotSettings = NamedTuple(
    "SnapshotSettings",
    [
        ("snapshot_path", str),
        ("work_dir", str),
        ("snapshot_components", List[ReplicationPath]),
        ("component_names", Set[str]),
        ("site_config", SiteConfiguration),
        ("create_pre_17_snapshot", bool),
    ])
F-:

Please keep in mind that the entire hook mechanism is intended only for very specialized tasks and experienced users.
If you make a mistake, things will break/disappear.
