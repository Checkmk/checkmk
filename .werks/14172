The host search option "The found hosts' (with child filtering)" was broken since the BI rework 2 years ago.
Any attempt to save this setting lead to an exception.

The fix for this problem required a small change in the API specification for the <tt>refer_to</tt> field
<ul>
<li>"refer_to": "host" -> "refer_to": {"type": "host"}</li>
<li>"refer_to": "child" -> "refer_to": {"type": "child"}</li>
<li>"refer_to": "parent" -> "refer_to": {"type": "parent"}</li>
<li>"refer_to": {was broken} -> "refer_to": {"type": "child_with", "conditions": {..}}</li>
</ul>
