You can now choose to freeze the structure of an aggregation group.
Once created, aggregations will never change their structure unless the user triggers a rebuild.

To enable frozen aggregations, you have to set the new option <tt>New aggregations are frozen</tt> in the aggregation configuration page.
If this option is set, all aggregation trees created from this aggregation are considered frozen right after their creation.
It is still possible to re-freeze single trees of such an aggregation group.

A snowflake icon has been introduced to indicate that an aggregation is frozen.
If you click on this icon, an additional view will show the difference between the frozen aggregate and its live version.
On this page you can also send a command to refreeze the frozen aggregation.
