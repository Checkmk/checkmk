Title: Prevent LDAP users from disappearing at remote sites

If a remote site had ldap connectors specified, which where not available at the central site,
the users on the remote site were regularly removed during activate changes.
This error was not always clearly visible, as the ldap users were resynchronised immediately after activate changes.
However, this introduced race conditions, such as users not known to the monitoring core or automatic logouts at the remote site.
