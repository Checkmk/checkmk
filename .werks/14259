Using EWS the account (used for both sending and receiving mails among other features) is
associated with identifiers, and the credentials username might be one of them for
convenience (but doesn't have to be).
This change provides an option to set the email address used to specify the account to be
contacted (i.e. PrimarySmtpAddress) in case it's different from the username.
If not specified the credentials username is being used as before.
This feature is only available for EWS and doesn't affect other email related active checks.
