Using <tt>GET</tt> requests to <tt>login.py</tt> means that the credentials supplied in the query parameters will appear in the site's Apache logs. To avoid unintentional leakage of such credentials, we <b>by default</b> block login attempts via the <tt>GET</tt> method.

If you used the <tt>GET</tt> method to, for example, export the data of views and dashboards in formats such as <tt>JSON</tt>, you can make use of the <tt>automation</tt> user as described in <a href="https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/wato_user.html#automation">documentation</a> article. For example, to display the view <i>allhosts</i> in <tt>JSON</tt> format, you can issue requests like this one <tt>curl -X GET 'http://localhost/heute/check_mk/view.py?_username=automation&_secret=[automation_secret]&view_name=allhosts&output_format=json'</tt>.

However, if you <b>still need to use the <tt>GET</tt> method to login to WATO</b>, you can manually enable this method as follows:

In the WATO interface, go to Setup > Global Settings > User interface, and switch on the <i>Enable login via GET requests</i> property.
