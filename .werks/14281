Title: Fix local privilege escalation from site users
Class: security
Compatible: compat
Component: omd

Each Checkmk site provides it's HTTP services (UI, APIs) using it's own site
Apache process. Global access to this site Apache is provided via the system
Apache which is opening the 80 and 443 ports for external requests, depending
on your system configuration.

To learn about the site Apache, the system Apache reads a reverse proxy
configuration provided by the site user. This could be used by a site user to
make the system Apache execute code as root user, since the System Apache is
typically started initially with root privileges.

To close this gap, we now need to separate the system Apache configuration from
the site user access.

To eliminate the privilege escalation, you will have to execute the command
<tt>omd update-apache-config [SITE]</tt> once for each of your sites after
the <tt>omd update</tt> command.

Besides the one-time fix, this change has a consequence for the use of <tt>omd
config</tt> and <tt>omd update</tt>. There are two situations where this is
relevant:

a) If you change the options APACHE_TCP_ADDR, APACHE_TCP_PORT or APACHE_MODE

You will have to call <tt>omd update-apache-config [SITE]</tt> as root user after
changing one of the site configuration options APACHE_TCP_ADDR, APACHE_TCP_PORT
or APACHE_MODE. This needs to be done to update and apply the system Apache
configuration. If you don't do this and start your site, your UI may be not
available anymore.

The <tt>omd config</tt> command will output a warning to notify you about this
necessary step in the future.

b) If you execute <tt>omd update</tt> and the proxy configuration changes

The update is performed as site user. Which means that, after this werk, we can
not update and apply the system apache configuration anymore automatically.

To apply the latest apache configuration, the command <tt>omd
update-apache-config [SITE]</tt> needs to be executed after the update.

The <tt>omd update</tt> will automatically detect the need for this additional
step and show you a confirmation dialog before starting the update to notify
you about this necessary step and giving you the chance to interrupt the
procedure in case you don't have the option to execute the command as root
user.

All maintained versions (>=1.6) are subject to this vulnerability. It is likely
that also previous versions were vulnerable. Users of previous versions are
highly recommended to update or consider other mitigations.

If you want to solve this issue for a site that is using an unpatched version,
you can do it by replacing the file <tt>/omd/apache/[SITE].conf</tt> with a
file like follows. Please note, that you will have to replace all occurrences
<tt>[SITE]</tt> with the ID of your site and <tt>[PORT]</tt> with the port of
the site apache. After you replaced the file, you will have to restart the
system Apache.
