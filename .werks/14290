The intended update warning that should be shown in case the
Apache hook was not up-to-date was not shown correctly in 2.1.0p9.

And during update a update warning
<tt>Unwanted etc/apache/apache-own.conf (unchanged, deleted by you)</tt>
was shown which could lead to confusions. This warning has been removed.
