Checkmk 2.1.0p10 changed the handling of the apache configuration with werk
#14290. This change introduced a new issue which could break the system apache
configuration in case a sites apache configuration was not yet updated to the
new system apache configuration.

The problem appears because as of 2.1.0p10 the file
<tt>etc/apache/apache-own.conf</tt> was removed from all sites. However, this
file must only be removed for sites which already updated the apache config.

In case you experience this issue, you can either update your apache
configuration with <tt>omd update-apache-config [SITE_ID]</tt> or restore your
old <tt>etc/apache/apache-own.conf</tt> in your site and restart the system
apache again.
