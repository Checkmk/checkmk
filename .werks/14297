In Checkmk 1.6 and previous versions custom dashboard element plugins could be
registered by deploying a file to
<tt>local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/dashboard/</tt> with the following code to
register with Checkmk:

C+:
dashlet_types["id_of_element"] = {
    "title"       : _("Title"),
    "sort_index"  : 45,
    "description" : "..."
    "render"      : dashlet_hoststats,
    "refresh"     : 60,
    "allowed"     : builtin_role_ids,
    "size"        : (30, 18),
    "resizable"   : False,
}

This mechanism was replaced with 1.6 and is now being removed. In case you
still have dashboard plugins using this mechanism, you need to rework your
plugin to be usable with Checkmk 2.2 or newer. Have a look at the dashboard
plugins shipped with Checkmk to, to see how it needs to be structured (e.g.
<tt>lib/check_mk/gui/plugins/dashboard/overview.py</tt>).
