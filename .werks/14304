The Checkmk config update routine (cmk-update-config) was not dealing with
global setting migration correctly. Instead of migrating global and site
specific settings during the site update, the values were only migrated
ad-hoc during runtime in some places and could lead to exceptions in other
places.

This fixes a regression introduced with #14473 in 2.1.0p11.
