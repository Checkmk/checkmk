The incompatibility of this werk affects users who have SAP Hana servers that
are not in the same timezone as their monitoring servers, and monitor their
backup duration. It also affects users who use the <tt>sap_hana_backup</tt>
parsed section to develop custom plugins.
<br>
The <tt>sap_hana_backup</tt> check either showed a negative timespan for the
backup duration (Checkmk version <=1.6.0) or showed an error reading
"ValueError(Cannot render negative timespan)" (Checkmk version >= 2.0.0) in the
event that the monitoring and SAP Hana servers are not in the same timezone.
This has been fixed. Users affected by this issue must deploy the agent plugin
to the monitored server in order to apply the fix. Users who are sure their
servers are in the same timezone do not need to re-deploy the agent plugin;
however, we strongly advise to do so.
