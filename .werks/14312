Title: hp_proliant_raid: new item names

The check "hp_proliant_raid" showed an empty item name in the event that a name
for the raid had not been set. This is problematic as all items must have an
item name in the new Check API. The item name has been amended to include both
the raid's name and its index. As a result, services need to be rediscovered on
the host.
