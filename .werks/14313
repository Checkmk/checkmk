The check "hp_proliant_raid" shows the progress percentage of rebuild tasks for
raids that are currently rebuilding. In some cases, this percentage was shown
as 4294967295%. The number "4294967295" is returned by the device in the event
that the progress of the rebuild task cannot be determined. The check now shows
an appropriate message instead.
