The incompatibility of this werk affects users who have services of inode
capable filesystems.

Due to a bug, default thresholds for inodes were never used by the
<tt>filesystem</tt> checks. This has been fixed: by default, the check shows a
WARN state when 10% of inodes are free or fewer, and a CRIT state when 5% of
inodes are free or fewer.

If you do not wish to apply any levels, it is possible to deactivate thresholds
by setting the "Levels for inodes" configuration option to "Ignore levels" in
the corresponding ruleset.
