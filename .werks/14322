If a remote site with replication enabled was succesfully logged in and the
option "Direct login to Web GUI allowed" for this site was disabled afterwards,
logging out of that site on page "Distributed Monitoring" and trying to login
again lead to the error "Login is not permitted: Cannot connect to remote
site: Permission denied: Invalid login credentials.".
