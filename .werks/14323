If the button "Create regular time-schedule for this report" was used, the
error "Cannot edit schedule entry for non-existing report MY_REPORT" could
occur.

Also, the chosen report is now selected for the created scheduler entry. It is
no longer necessary to select it from a dropdown list on the next page.
