If dashboards were created with a custom topic in version 2.0, the error
"ValueError (invalid literal for int() with base 10: '')" could occur after
updating to 2.1.

Possible workaround was to change the topic of the affected dashboard to a
builtin topic and run "cmk-update-config" as site user again. The dashboard
should be ok after that and you can change back to the custom topic.
