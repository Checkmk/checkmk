If a dashboard was configured with option "Show the header of the dashboard
with the configured title" disabled, the "Edit dashboard" link only showed the
dashboard.

The option to edit the dashboard is now disabled for such dashboards and will
show a hint, that the header must be enabled to use the edit mode.
