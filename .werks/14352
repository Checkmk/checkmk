Since werk 12185 we automatically show metrics in the output of local checks. The metric names
are now consistently converted to sentence case. Below are examples for the automatic conversion

	LONG_METRIC_NAME -> Long metric name
	recommendation4WHO -> Recommendation 4 WHO
	weekIncidence -> Week incidence
	zombie_apocalypse -> Zombie apocalypse
