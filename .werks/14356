Previously, to report the Virtual size of a process Windows 
agent used metric 'VirtualSize' from WMI counter 'Win32_Process'.
Unfortunately, in Windows this metric means not the Virtual 
size of process but the size of the process virtual address space, 
usually 2TB for 32-bit application. As a result monitoring 
information related to the process Virtial size was useless.

Since this release, Windows agent uses 'Commit Charge' Win32 metric 
to correctly report the Virtual size of a process, thus solving 
the problem. 'Commit Charge' is the total amount of virtual memory 
of a process that must be backed by either physical memory or the 
page file.
