Previously, the Windows agent controller used TCP-IP as a channel to 
local Windows agent, but this type of communication can lead to port 
conflicts. Also, mailslots inherently provide slightly better level 
of local security.

If, for some reason it is required to use TCP-IP as a channel, 
you may set system.controller.agent_channel in the check_mk.user.yml 
to any appropriate value, for example, "localhost:28250".
