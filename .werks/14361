Previously, Windows agent used retry_count as a maximal allowed 
count of plugin's failures. If the count of failures exceeded the 
limit set by retry_count, then the plugin had been excluded from 
execution. Such behavior may break monitoring or updating in 
some cases.

Since this release, the retry_count is defined as a maximally 
allowed count of attempts to call a plugin before clearing the 
previously gathered data (also known as a cache). This approach 
is fully compliant with the documentation, the help and the 
functionality of the Linux agent.

The incompatibility in this werk is limited by definition: the
Windows agent will continue to call a plugin even if the number
of errors exceeds retry_count. This is the same behavior as when
retry_count is not set at all.

IMPORTANT: Windows agent always ignores retry_count for synchronous 
plugins. Windows agent may decrease value of retry_count if the 
value is set too high.
