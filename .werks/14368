This werk introduces the implementation of the site management endpoints. These endpoints
now allow the API user to create, delete, update and retrieve distributed monitoring
connection configurations. It's also possible to login to / logout of a remote site via
the endpoints. The new endpoints replace those from the Web-API. Client scripts should
be adjusted accordingly.
