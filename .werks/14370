This werk adds the AWS/CloudFront check.

With this check, you can monitor and add alarms on the following
metrics for each CloudFront distribution: Requests, Bytes downloaded,
Bytes uploaded, Total error rate, 4xx error rate, 5xx error rate.

A new service will be created for each CloudFront distribution and you
can filter the ones to monitor by distribution ID or by AWS tags.
