Previous to this Werk it was possible to inject arbitrary shell commands
when sending SMS notifications. For this, attackers would have needed to
place a crafted string in a user's Pager Address, which was not properly
escaped by the SMS script.

In most setups, this issue will not be exploitable: Changing a user's
Pager Address requires the User Management permission. Users with that
permission are effectively Administrators and can thus already
legitimately execute code in the Site context. Note however, that in
some setups the attribute can also be configured by external interfaces,
for example via LDAP User Synchronization.

<b>Affected Versions</b>: All currently supported versions are affected:
1.6, 2.0, and 2.1.

<b>Mitigations</b>: As an immediate mitigation all notifications via the
method "SMS (using smstools)" can be disabled. Note that users' personal
notification rules are affected as well.

<b>Indicators of Compromise</b>: If you suspect this issue might have
been exploited in your installation, validate users' Pager Address
fields. Check the Audit Log for changes to this field.

<b>Vulnerability Management</b>: We have rated the issue with a CVSS
Score of 8.0 (High) with the following CVSS vector:
<tt>CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H</tt>.
We have assigned CVE-2022-46303 for this issue.

<b>Changes</b>: This Werk replaces a hazardous call to
<tt>os.system</tt> by a safer alternative and adds additional validation
to the Pager Address before attempting to send SMS to it. Valid Pager
Addresses may now include letters, numbers, space characters, any of the
characters <tt>. / - ()</tt>, as well as a <tt>+</tt> character at the
beginning.
