Title: Fix command injection in livestatus query headers
Class: security
Compatible: compat
Component: livestatus

Edition: cre
Knowledge: doc
Level: 1
State: unknown
Version: 2.0.0p29

Prior to this Werk it was possible to inject livestatus commands in Checkmk's livestatus wrapper and python API.
Attackers could add additional commands in the AuthUser query header using newline characters.
This allowed running arbitrary livestatus commands, including external commands to the core.

The issue could only be exploited by attackers from localhost, where the tampered header could be injected in a request to graph data.

We thank Stefan Schiller (SonarSource) for reporting this issue.
