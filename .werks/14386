The welcome message displayed by <tt>omd create</tt> now recommends setting the password for cmkadmin using <tt>htpasswd -B -C 12</tt>.
This way htpasswd will use bcrypt with a work factor of 12 instead of MD5 to hash the password, which is consistent with the behavior when setting passwords in WATO.
