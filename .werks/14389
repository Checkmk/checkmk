This Werk adds the tool cmk-passwd.
cmk-passwd can add and change Checkmk user passwords via the commandline, as could previously be achieved using htpasswd.
Users are advised to use cmk-passwd instead of htpasswd to manage Checkmk user passwords from now on.

To change a password with cmk-passwd, for example the password of cmkadmin, simply run
C+:
cmk-passwd cmkadmin
C-:
The tool will then prompt the password and ask you to re-type it for verification.
See <tt>cmk-passwd -h</tt> for further options.

cmk-passwd selects the correct password file location and password hashing algorithm for the installed version of Checkmk.
Behind the scenes it currently still writes to the same file (<tt>etc/htpasswd</tt>) in htpasswd-compatible format.
This might be changed in the future though.
