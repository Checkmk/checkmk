Beginning with Checkmk version 2.2.0, the use of certain special characters in user IDs will no longer be allowed.
As a result, some user IDs that were previously valid in Checkmk version 2.1.0 will become invalid in version 2.2.0.

Local users created in the user management UI (Setup > Users) will remain valid, as restrictions had already been enforced here.
Hence, only users from external connections such as LDAP will be affected.

With this Werk you will be warned about users that will become incompatible in the future.
When you run the <tt>omd update</tt> command, it will display a warning message including the list of affected users.
Moreover, the user management page (Setup > Users) in WATO it will also display a warning message if incompatible user IDs are found.

To be compatible with Checkmk version 2.2.0 please ensure that all user IDs adhere to the following restrictions:
The first character of a user ID must be a digit, a letter, an underscore (<tt>_</tt>), or a dollar sign (<tt>$</tt>).
The rest of the user ID may additionally contain dash (<tt>-</tt>), at (<tt>@</tt>), and dot (<tt>.</tt>).

If you require certain characters that would no longer be allowed and changing user IDs is not feasible in your system, please contact Checkmk support for assistance.
