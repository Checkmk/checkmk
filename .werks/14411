If you manage your check mk configuration only via the UI you are not affected by this change.

The old pre 1.6 tuple ruleset format in rules.mk is not allowed any longer. See werk 7352
for the new format. If a tuple rule is found checkmk will throw an exception with detailed
information how it expects the rule to look like. We do not guarantee that this information will
be included after version 2.2 .
