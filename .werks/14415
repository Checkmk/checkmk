There are two options for rendering a raw value in bytes as a human-readable number:
LI: SI unit prefixes, where the base factor is 1,000 and the unit prefixes are k, M, G, etc. For example, 1,500 B would be rendered as 1.5 kB.
LI: IEC unit prefixes, where the base factor is 1,024 and the unit prefixes are Ki, Mi, Gi, etc. For example, 1,500 B would be rendered as 1.46 KiB.

Before this werk, Checkmk mixed up these two systems when rendering graphs and
dashboard elements by using a base factor of 1,024 in combination with SI unit
prefixes. After this werk, Checkmk consistently uses IEC prefixes instead of the
mixup mentioned above. Hence, numerical values will remain unchanged, but the
displayed units will change from kB, MB, GB, ... to KiB, MiB, GiB, ... .

Furthermore, as a result of this werk, there are now check plugins which
report a given value using (consistent) SI unit prefixes but visualize the same
value in a graph using IEC unit prefixes. While this is of course not optimal,
we prefer this intermediate state over the state before this werk (inconsistent
SI unit prefixes with mixed up base factors).
