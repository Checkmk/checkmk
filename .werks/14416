The agent controller (<tt>cmk-agent-ctl</tt>) crashed on IPv4-only hosts when
attempting to open a TCP socket in order to allow Checkmk to connect to the host
and collect agent data. Note that on Linux hosts, this crash only occured if
IPv6 was disabled at the kernel level. The corresponding error message read
C+:
ERROR [cmk_agent_ctl] Address family not supported by protocol (os error 97)
C-:

Note that this crash only affected the transport of agent data, not the host
registration.
