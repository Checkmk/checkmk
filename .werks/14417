There are two options for rendering a raw value in bytes as a human-readable number:
LI: SI unit prefixes, where the base factor is 1,000 and the unit prefixes are k, M, G, etc. For example, 1,500 B would be rendered as 1.5 kB.
LI: IEC unit prefixes, where the base factor is 1,024 and the unit prefixes are Ki, Mi, Gi, etc. For example, 1,500 B would be rendered as 1.46 KiB.

Before this werk, Checkmk mixed up these two systems when rendering service
outputs by using a base factor of 1,024 in combination with SI unit prefixes.
After this werk, Checkmk renders byte-related units in service outputs consistenly:
LI: When displaying e.g. "1.23 MB" in a service output, the underlying value in bytes is 1.23 * 1000^2 B.
LI: When displaying e.g. "14.7 KiB" in a service output, the underlying value in bytes is 14.7 * 1024 B.
