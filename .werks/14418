This werk might be incompatible only for users with custom check plugins in the
legacy check API. The following rendering functions in the legacy check API have
been changed. In case you are negatively affected by these changes, we strongly
recommend to migrate to the new API (see <a href="https://checkmk.com/blog/migrating-check-plug-ins-to-checkmk-2-0">this blog post</a> for help and further references).

LI: <tt>get_age_human_readable</tt>: Changes in rendering format only, no API changes.
LI: <tt>get_bytes_human_readable</tt>: SI and IEC prefixes are now used consistently, see
also werk #14417. Furthermore, the value for the <tt>base</tt> argument must now be either 1,000
or 1,024, any other value results in a <tt>ValueError</tt>. Finally, the argument <tt>precision</tt>
is now ignored. Instead, the number of decimal places is set automatically.
LI: <tt>get_nic_speed_human_readable</tt>: Changes in rendering format only, no API changes.
LI: <tt>get_percent_human_readable</tt>: The argument <tt>scientific_notation</tt> is now ignored.
Hence, values are not rendered in scientific notation any more. Furthermore, percentages are
always rendered with two decimal places, except for very small values.
LI: <tt>get_number_with_precision</tt>: No unit prefixes are added any more to the rendered
value. Instead, the value is displayed as is with the specified number of decimal places. Hence,
the argument <tt>base</tt> is now ignored. Furthermore, the arguments <tt>drop_zeroes</tt> and
<tt>zero_non_decimal</tt> are also ignored.
