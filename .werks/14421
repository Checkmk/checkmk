The check plugins <tt>mssql_datafiles/transactionlogs</tt> did not handle unlimited instances
correctly. Specifically, the maximum size only took the space still available on the filesystem
into account, but not the current size of the file. This resulted in too low thresholds in case
of percentage levels.
