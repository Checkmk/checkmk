The check plugins <tt>ipmi</tt> and <tt>ipmi_sensors</tt> both monitor IPMI sensors. They are user-
configurable via the ruleset "IPMI sensors". There, users can define custom monitoring states based
on the status text reported by the sensors (option "Set states of IPMI sensor status texts").

Before this werk, these settings were evaluated and a corresponding service output was created,
however, this output did not override the default behaviour of these check plugins. For example,
the sensor status text "non-critical" results in WARNING by default. Users could configure a rule
to instead map "non-critical" to OK, however, the overall service state would still be WARNING in
this case.

With this werk, users can fully override the default behaviour and set e.g. "non-critical" to OK.
