The incompatibility of this change affects users who monitor the "Summary Status 0" service on Fujitsu storage systems.
The status of the service "Summary Status 0" turns to unknown due to a changed service name. This means that this service needs to be rediscovered on the hosts.
The new service name is "Summary Status".
