This change affects asynchronously executed agent plugins for the Checkmk agents for Linux, AIX, Solaris, FreeBSD and OpenWRT.

If such plugins did not terminate after a set amount of time, the corresponding process is killed by the agent.

Previously, the cached data would still be transmitted, eventually letting the affected services go stale.
With this werk we no longer transmit the outdated data, which will result in the services being UNKNOWN.
This behaviour is consistent with a synchrounus plugin that crashes.
