This Werk only affects users that configured <i>Filesystem</i> services to ignore individual mount points via the variable <tt>inventory_df_exclude_mountpoints</tt> in a <tt>.mk</tt> file.

This variable is no longer supported (as the corresponding plugins are migrated to the new API).

You can use the <i>Disabled services</i> ruleset to disable those services in the <i>Setup</i> menu.
