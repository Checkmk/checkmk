Title: cisco_temperature: Use sensors name instead of description

The check plugin <i>Cisco Devices: Temperature Sensors</i> /<tt>cisco_temperature</tt>) previously used the entPhysicalDescr MIB instead of the entPhysicalName MIB (.2 and .7 of 1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1 respectively).

On Cisco IOS-XE the entPhysicalDescr MIB and entPhysicalName MIB are identical.
However on Cisco IOS-XR all fibre module power levels show "Power Sensor" in entPhysicalDescr, and the unique interface name in entPhysicalName.
Before this change IOS-XR would only have a single power sensor called "DOM Power Sensor".
