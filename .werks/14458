Werk #14333 should fix the functionality of host and service type filter in
views wth datasource "log" but broke it for host and service views.

This werk restores the behaviour of the filter before 2.1.0p3 / 2.0.0p26.

For views with datasource "log", please use the filter "Log: state information".
