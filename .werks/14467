Since werk #13501 the user connector is used to only contact connections, the
user is configured for.

If a connection was deleted and a new one was used, the user still had the
deleted connector in his profile, leading to messages like "SKIP SYNC "MY_USER"
(name conflict with user from "MY_OLD_CONNECTION" connector)" in
~/var/log/web.log on LDAP logging set to debug.

We now make sure that the connection still exists.
