The renaming of hosts includes the renaming of parents, if the host that is
renamed is a parent of other hosts.

This renaming was faulty if the child host was in a subfolder that inherited
the parent attribute from a parent folder, leading to messages like "The parent
"FOO" of the host "BAR" is not defined on this site" on activation of changes.

Note that the parent was renamed correctly in the parent folder where the
attribute was effectivly set. Saving the folder properties again after renaming
fixed the mentioned error message.
