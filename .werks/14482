Previously to this Werk the Session cookies were signed with with calculating a
SHA256 hash over username, session id, a serial plus a secret. This could in
theory lead to a "partial message collision".

Since we parse the data given in the cookie and test for validity, we are
confident that such an attack is not possible. But to be future-proof we switch
to proper HMAC for signing the cookie value. This will invalidate all session
cookies for a site. Therefore all users have to reauthenticate to retrieve new
valid cookies.
