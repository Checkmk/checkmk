Update various dependencies

LI: pyjwt 1.7.1 to 2.4.0: This fixes CVE-2022-29217. Since Checkmk does not
validate JWT tokens the vulnerability does not affect Checkmk.

LI: Babel 2.8.0 to 2.10.3: This fixes CVE-2021-42771. We could not exploit the
vulnerability in our tests. So it is unlikely Checkmk was vulnerable to this
vulnerability.

LI: PyPDF2 1.26.0 to 2.10.2: This fixes CVE-2022-24859. Checkmk was not
vulnerable to this vulnerability, since Checkmk does not parse untrusted PDFs.

LI: reportlab 3.5.34 to 3.6.11: This fixes CVE-2020-28463. Checkmk does not use
the vulnerable functions and is therefore not affected.

LI: rsa 4.6 to 4.9: This fixes CVE-2020-25658. Checkmk does not use rsa
directly (transitive dependency). We could not find a method to exploit this
vulnerability in Checkmk.

Checkmk was not vulnerable to any of those vulnerabilities.

We calculated the following CVSS score for this 0.0 (None):
CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N

This CVSS of null is meant for semi-automatic scrapers in order to show that no exploitation was possible.
