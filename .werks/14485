Title: Fix session cookie validation on RestAPI
Class: security
Compatible: compat
Component: rest-api
Date: 1662109524
Edition: cre
Knowledge: doc
Level: 1
Version: 2.0.0p29

Before this Werk expired sessions were still valid on the RestAPI, since the
RestAPI only vaildated the Cookie signature.

An attacker who was able to steal a session cookie could use that cookie on the
RestAPI even after the session expired.  Some actions though require access to
the user session, these action fail due to the expired session. Some actions do
not access the session and are therefore possible.

<b>Affected Versions</b>:
All versions with the RestAPI are affected: 2.0, and 2.1.

<b>Mitigations</b>:
Immediate mitigations are not available.
