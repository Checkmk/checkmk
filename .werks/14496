It is possible to configure the <tt>df</tt> check to exlude the space reserved
for the root user from the used space. The metric 'fs_used_percent' which is
shown in the perfometer of any <tt>filesystem</tt> service did not respect this
configuration, showing the percentage of used space of the total filesystem,
including the reserved space. This has been fixed.
