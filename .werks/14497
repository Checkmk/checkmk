The incompatibility of this change only affects users who use the metric for
filesystem space reserved for the root user ("reserved") in a custom graph and
rely on this metric to be created when the "Show space reserved for the root
user" option is enabled.

The metric for filesystem free space ("fs_free") is now always created,
regardless of the configuration options chosen for the check. Previously, it
was only created when the "Exclude space reserved for the root user from
calculation of used space" option was enabled.

The metric for filesystem space resereved for root ("reserved") was generated
when either the "Exclude space reserved for the root user from calculation of
used space" or the "Show space reserved for the root user". It is now only
created when the former of these options is enabled.

These changes do not affect the built-in graph, "Filesystem size and used
space".
