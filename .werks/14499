The activate changes process could be slow when activating changes for multiple
sites in a distributed monitoring set-up. The activation would eventually run
into an error similar to "Failed to start activation [502]: Proxy Error". This
was due to the implementation that synchronises users and user settings across
all sites. Instead of copying these files in their entirety, a hard link is now
created, reducing I/O on the monitoring server.
