We have added a new agent plugin and corresponding section plugin to monitor
network interfaces. These plugins provide essentially the same information as
the section <tt>lnx_if</tt>, which is a Checkmk agent section, and are an
alternative: if both sections are provided, only <tt>lnx_container_host_if</tt>
is considered.
Note that this agent plugin is not supported by the agent bakery.
