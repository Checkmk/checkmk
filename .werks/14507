The management board address can hold IPv4 addresses, IPv6 addresses and
hostnames. The REST API only validated the IP addresses but rejected
the hostnames. This host attribute is used at the host creation, update
and display endpoints.

The affected endpoints are:

 - POST /domain-types/host_config/actions/bulk-create/invoke
 - POST /domain-types/host_config/actions/bulk-update/invoke
 - GET /domain-types/host_config/collections/all
 - POST /domain-types/host_config/collections/all
 - GET /objects/host_config/{host_name}
 - PUT /objects/host_config/{host_name}

This werk adds a validator that allows hostnames set through the REST API
as well. No futher action is needed.
