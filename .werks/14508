Title: profiling using "enable_by_var" in the REST API

When using the query string variable "_profile=1" to dynamically enable profiling,
the REST API complained about "_profile" being an unknown paramter. This is no longer
the case, as the argument is now removed before passing the request to the REST API.

There are no futher actions to be taken.
