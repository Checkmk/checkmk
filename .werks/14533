Title: azure agent: handle graph client errors gracefully

The graph client API calls require some optional permissions so we are
handling these permissions errors by notifying the user of the issue but
by keeping the state to OK since it is a legit state.
The section that is impacted is the "azure_ad" one.

The message currently displayed is
"Graph client: Insufficient privileges to complete the operation." and
the permission that is currently needed is the Graph permission
"Directory.Read.All" that requires admin consent.

That permission needs to be granted to the check mk app created in Azure
during the setup of checkmk Azure monitoring.
