This werk fixes a bug in the runas plugin that was preventing it to run
the plugins as any user other than root.

This also impacted mrpe plugins included in the runas config when they
were run asynchronously.

The error shown by the agent output in debug mode was
'check_mk_agent: line 211: su [RUNAS_USER] -c "[CHECK_FILE_PATH]": No such file or directory'
