The Kubernetes node conditions check parameters allow the user to configure the monitoring state
if a condition is either faulty or unavailable. However, the unavailability keyword is misleading
as the condition could be either unknown or completely missing. This werk, therefore, rephrases the
parameter titles to make this more explicit.
