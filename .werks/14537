This werk introduces the new /objects/service_discovery/{host_name} endpoint which
returns the latest service discovery result of a host. The response object includes the
check table with all discovered services, the host labels, the vanished and new labels.
The existing /domain-types/service/collections/services endpoint, which only returned the
discovered services of a specific phase is deprecated and will be removed with Checkmk 2.3.
Users should consider migrating the functionalities to the new endpoint.
