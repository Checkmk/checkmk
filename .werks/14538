This werk moves the existing "Execute a service discovery on a host" functionality to the
new /domain-types/service_discovery_run/actions/start/invoke endpoint. The existing
/objects/host/{host_name}/actions/discover_services/invoke endpoint is itself deprecated
and will be removed with Checkmk 2.3. Users should consider migrating the functionalities
to the new endpoint.
