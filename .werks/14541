In certain multi-site setups, the host and service problems graphs in the main dashboard ("Total
host problems", "Total service problems", "Percentage of total service problems") are not rendered.
This happens if there are too many Checkmk hosts (hosts running Checkmk sites) in the monitoring,
which leads to error messages such as
C+:
Sorry, you cannot create combined graphs for more than 100 objects
C-:
or
C+:
As soon as you add your Checkmk server(s) to the monitoring, a graph showing the history of your
host problems will appear here.
C-:

This werk solves this issue for setups with many Checkmk hosts whose sites are however <i>not</i>
connected via distributed monitoring to the site(s) on which these hosts are monitored.
