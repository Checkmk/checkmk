On SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3 systems, the <tt>ssh</tt> command crashed with
C+:
ssh: symbol lookup error: ssh: undefined symbol: EVP_KDF_CTX_free, version OPENSSL_1_1_1d
C-:
when executed as a site user.

Note that this affected both the direct execution of <tt>ssh</tt> on the command line as well as
other programs using this command, such as the special agent for IBM SVC / V7000 storage systems.
