On SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 systems, the <tt>ssh</tt> command crashed with
C+:
ssh: relocation error: ssh: symbol EVP_KDF_CTX_free, version OPENSSL_1_1_1d not defined in file libcrypto.so.1.1 with link time reference
C-:
when executed as a site user.

Note that this affected both the direct execution of <tt>ssh</tt> on the command line as well as
other programs using this command, such as the special agent for IBM SVC / V7000 storage systems.
