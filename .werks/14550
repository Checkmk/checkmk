The <tt>mk_logwatch</tt> agent plugin can be deployed via the agent bakery (ruleset <i>Text logfiles
(Linux, Solaris, Windows)</i>). In this ruleset, users can specify regular expressions for
processing log messages. Before this werk, users could specify regular expressions to classify
messages (OK/WARNING/CRITICAL), to ignore messages and to rewrite messages.

As of this werk, users can additionally specify regular expressions to combine multiple log lines
into a single message via the APPEND option, see the help of the bakery ruleset for details. One use
case for this is the processing of multi-line stack traces.

Note that this feature was already supported by the <tt>mk_logwatch</tt> agent plugin before this
werk, but it was not configurable via the agent bakery.
