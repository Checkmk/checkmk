Previously, the Prometheus special agent would query the endpoint `/api/v1/targets` regardless of
what was configured in the Prometheus rule. This was an additional burden on users, which did not
specify any scrape targets and therefore do not need this endpoint. E.g., it can lead to additional
timeouts. With this werk, the endpoint `/api/v1/targets` is only queried if necessary.
