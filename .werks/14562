Previously, the Prometheus special agent would use the path prefix as a URL base prefix.
For example, specifying the use of the host IP address, e.g. <tt>1.2.3.4</tt>, together with a
prefix, e.g., <tt>my_prefix</tt> would result in an API call to
C+:
https://my_prefix1.2.3.4/api/v1/status/buildinfo
C-:
In particular, this behaviour deviated from the description in the Prometheus rule. With this werk,
the path prefix is prepended to the API calls instead, e.g.,
C+:
https://1.2.3.4/my_prefix/api/v1/status/buildinfo
C-:
Users, which have specified a path prefix, are migrated to the new option
<tt>Custom URL base prefix</tt>, which has the same behaviour as the old path prefix option.
