During discovery the plugin <tt>heartbeat_rscstatus</tt> stores its discovery state.  Updating
Checkmk from 2.0.0 to 2.1.0 or updates within those versions would cause these states to be lost.
This is indicated by following error message:

C+:
-| 8/27 Rewriting autochecks...
-| Transform failed: host='host', plugin='heartbeat_rscstatus', ruleset='heartbeat_rscstatus', params={'discovered_state': 'none'}, error=AssertionError('non-empty params vanished')
C-:

With this werk, the states are correctly persisted.
