Previously, the inventory plugin <tt>inv_if</tt> would crash while inventorizing interfaces on a
innovaphone IP811 with the message
C+:
Parsing of section inv_if failed
C-:
This could potentially happen on other devices, if they report 'NULL' to indicate missing values.
With this werk, interfaces with this kind of missing information are omitted.
