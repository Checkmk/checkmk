Previously, the Kubernetes special agent would exit with the following message:
C+:
[special_kube] Agent exited with code 1: Can not convert to timestamp: 'None' of type <class 'NoneType'>
C-:
This would occur if there was a custom Pod condition present in the cluster with type
<tt>cloud.google.com/load-balancer-neg-ready</tt>. With this werk, the error no longer occurs.
