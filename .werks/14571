Previously, if the field <tt>.status.images</tt> of a Kubernetes Node contained any element with
<tt>names</tt> set to <tt>null</tt>, the API response would be rejected by agent_kube with the error
C+:
[special_kube] Agent exited with code 1: Invalid value for `names`, must not be `None`
C-:
With this change, this error is fixed.
