Title: Prometheus: Deprecation of 'kube-state-metrics' scrape target
Class: fix

Version: 2.2.0b1

The Prometheus agent provides the `kube-state-metrics` as a possible data source. This in turn would
enable the following checks.

<ul>
  <li>k8s_resources</li>
  <li>k8s_namespaces</li>
  <li>k8s_conditions</li>
  <li>k8s_pod_container</li>
  <li>k8s_service_info</li>
  <li>k8s_daemon_pods</li>
</ul>

However, these checks are no longer actively maintained, since they have been superseded by their
counterparts in the Kubernetes agent. Moreover, the `kube-state-metrics` target
<ul>
  <li>does not support new versions of kube-state-metrics (v2.0.0-alpha / 2020-09-16 or newer),</li>
  <li>does not provide the information required to fully support monitoring and</li>
  <li>is stricly inferior to monitoring via the Kubernetes agent.</li>
</ul>
For this reason, this option will be removed in Checkmk 2.3.0.

If you are affected by this change, you need to setup your monitoring as per these instructions:
