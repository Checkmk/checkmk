The rules <tt>Prometheus</tt> and <tt>Alertmanager</tt> both allowed omitting the server address
from the connection option by specifying <tt>IP Address</tt> or <tt>Host name</tt>. The
corresponding agents would then generate URLs based on the host configuration.

These options add complexity, are incompatible with proxy setups and less transparent than simply
specifying the relevant URL.

Therefore, these options will be removed in Checkmk 2.3.0.

Affected users need to use the <tt>Custom URL</tt> option to specify the server address. For
instance, assume your rule specifies
<ul>
  <li><tt>IP Address</tt> </li>
  <li><tt>Port</tt>: <tt>9000</tt></li>
  <li><tt>Custom path prefix</tt>: <tt>my_prefix</tt></li>
</ul>
and your host has the address <tt>1.2.3.4</tt>. Then the new rule needs to specify
C+:
1.2.3.4:9000/my_prefix/api/v1/status/buildinfo
C-:
