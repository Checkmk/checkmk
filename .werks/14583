Previously, the dcd could not handle host configurations, if they were in an
inconsistent state. In such cases, it would stop updating and deleting the host
configurations. The following error would be shown:
C+:
k: api_attributes[k] for k in future_attributes["locked_attributes"] + internal_keys
KeyError: 'site'
C-:
This meant, the attributes of the host were not present, even though they were
supposed to be locked by the dcd. With this werk, the dcd will not crash.
Instead it assigns the attributes, which are configured by the connection. This
includes the internal attribute "Locked by", which is inaccessible via the GUI.
