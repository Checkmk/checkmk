Title: Fix attribute update and deletion of existing hosts

Previously, the dcd would stop updating and deleting the host configurations, if they were in 
an inconsistent state. The following error would be shown:
C+:
k: api_attributes[k] for k in future_attributes["locked_attributes"] + internal_keys
KeyError: 'site'
C-:
With this werk, the dcd will not crash. Instead it assigns the attributes, which are configured by
the connection.
