Previously, the Kubernetes special agent could raise the following error.
C+:
ValueError: Pod's (0a5bef2e... ) node is not present in the cluster
C-:
Typically, if a Pod is scheduled on a Node and the Node is deleted, then the Pod will no longer
be assigned to that Node. However, f this fails it then results in the error of the agent.

With this Werk, the Pod will show the NodeName of the non-existing Node. Since the Node does not
exist, the Pod will not participate in any Node-specific aggregation.
