The plugin livestatus_status reports the metrics
LI: <tt>Livestatus connects</tt>
LI: <tt>Livestatus requests</tt>
LI: <tt>Log messages</tt>
LI: <tt>Host checks</tt>
LI: <tt>Service checks</tt>
Previously, the check would compute rates based on the corresponding counters. This did not take
into account that these counters are set to zero after a program restart. With this werk, the rates
are now direcly provided by <tt>MK Livestatus</tt>.
