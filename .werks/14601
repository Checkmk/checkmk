Note: For most users, this change will be compatible and purely cosmetic.

Before this change, the service item for the "IIS Application Pool" service
was surrounded by some ugly characters. They aspired to be single-quotes, but
they didn't make it through the GUI.

If you happen to rely on the old service name by rule condidions, you'll
have to adapt the corresponding entries.
