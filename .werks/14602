The agent updater used to use the fixed directory <tt>var/lib/check_mk_agent/</tt>
to unpack its CA certificates regardless of what was configured in the rule
"Installation paths for agent files"

Technically spoken, this means that the agent updater now respects
the <tt>MK_VARDIR</tt> environment variable.
