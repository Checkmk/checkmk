By choosing a legacy 32bit OID module as data source, the
"Memory ..." service for some Cisco devices previously displayed wrong
values if the memory of an item exceeded 4GB.

While the correct 64bit OID module (if available) was already selected for
Cisco ASA devices before, it's now selected for all Cisco devices.
