This Werk is only incompatible for users that actually tried to use the broken
<i>trust-cert</i> option of the agent updater.

This is a regression since Checkmk 2.0.

When invoking cmk-update-agent with <tt>--trust-cert</tt> or <tt>-t</tt> option,
you can trust and save the root certificate needed for the HTTPS connection to the Checkmk
server directly from the server's certificate chain (if it's stored there).

Previously, the fetched certificate got saved in a wrong format (python <tt>bytes</tt>
instead of <tt>str</tt>), leading to a crash when the agent updater tries to import it
in subsequent calls.

You can fix your broken installations by editing the host-local file
<tt>/etc/cmk-update-agent.state</tt> or
<tt>%ProgramData%\checkmk\agent\config\cmk-update-agent.state</tt>, respectively:
Please remove all occurring <tt>b</tt> prefixes from the <tt>local_certificates</tt> entry.
Alternatively, you can update the agent once manually by calling the agent updater with
<tt>--insecure</tt> option. This will skip the certificate handling entirely; the updated
agent updater can then fix the malformed values by itself.
