In some situations, it could happen that some agent packages are signed
with an invalid signature after baking/signing with "Bake and sign agents"
action.<br>
The cause for this was that the signature of pre-existing packages sometimes
wouldn't get updated if the package had to be repackaged for a bakery revision update.

This resulted in the agent updater being unable to update affected hosts
and exiting with message <tt>signature #<i>n</i> is invalid</tt>, and the
matching <i>Check_MK</i> service showing a <i>WARN</i> state.

Signatures will be fixed and updates will continue to work after first
bake&sign action after applying this Werk.
