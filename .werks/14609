This Werk will be compatible for most users. See below for details.

When using the prepackaged agent package on DPKG or RPM based systems,
some xinetd/system files are marked as config files and won't be removed
on uninstallation/update.

This leads to problems when updating from a prepackaged agent package
to a bakery agent package, as leftover service or unit files would
occupy the listening agent port.

Bakery agent packages will now remove all deprecated systemd/xinetd
files that may be leftover from old installations before activating the
new super server coming from the new package.

Please be aware that, starting with this Werk, agent packages from the agent
bakery will discard changes made to xinetd/systemd files from
a previously installed prepackaged/raw edition agent package. While this
is expected behavior for bakery packages, it may still change some agent
installations in an unexpected way, because this was done inconsequently
in the past.
