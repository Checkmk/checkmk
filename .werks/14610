Title: super_server: Missing systemd units/xinetd services after agent update (RPM)

After agent update to a 2.1 linux agent (prepackaged and bakery versions)
on RPM based systems, the agent installation may end up with missing systemd
units or a missing xinetd service file.

As a workaround, or to recover from an agent installation with broken super-server,
agents can be reinstalled once manually with <tt>cmk-update-agent --reinstall</tt>
or <tt>cmk-update-agent --force</tt> to restore the missing file(s).
Subsequent agent updates won't run into the same problem again.

With this Werk, the initial agent update to version 2.1 won't run into the
problem in the first place.
