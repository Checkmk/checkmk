Mails sent by <code>check_mail_loop</code> had been deprecated only after 24h, which potentially resulted
in thousands of mails in circumstances when sent mails could not be processed for whatever
reasons.
This change lowers this age to 2h resulting in 'only' 120 mails (for this active check being
executed every minute).
