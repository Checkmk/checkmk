This werk changes the way extension packages (<i>MKP</i>s) are uploaded, installed, modified and/or downloaded in the GUI.

This change is necessary to better support Checkmk version upgrades on large distributed installations.

The main difference is that the <i>upload</i> and the <i>enabling</i> of an MKP are implemented as two different steps.
Here is how common tasks are done now:

<b>Upload and install a package</b>:
Previously, this was one step.
It failed if packages were not suitable for the sites Checkmk version or if it collided with an already installed MKP.
Now users can always upload the package.
It is then shown in the list of <i>available</i> packages.
From this list, you can choose to <i>enable</i>, <i>download</i> and <i>remove</i> it.
The operation of "enabling" might still fail for the reasons mentioned above, in which case the MKP will be displayed in the list of "inactive" packages.

<b>Create new or edit existing MKPs</b>:
Users can edit active packages (during operation) or create new MKPs from unpackaged files in the <tt>local</tt> folder.
This is not changed.
Previously the MKP was created "on demand" if the user clicked the <i>download</i> button.
With this werk, the MKP is created immediately when the user hits "<i>Save</i>" in the package creation page.
The <i>download</i> button can be found in the "<i>Available</i>" section.
