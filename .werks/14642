Services belonging to the check plugin formerly known as "Throughput LUNs" (<tt>hpux_lunstats</tt>) are now created by a different plugin and behave differently.

LI: They are no longer configured by the WATO ruleset "<i>Disk IO levels (old style checks)</i>", but to the WATO rulseset "<i>Disk IO levels</i>"
LI: The metrics produced are no longer called 'read' and 'write', but 'disk_read_throughput' and 'disk_write_throughtput'

No rediscovery is required.
We realize this is an inconveniance for affected users.
However we believe that consolidating check plugins is a worthy goal, in particular for user of less popular operating systems such as HP UX, since they will be maintained more regularly that way.
