Users can now configure Checkmk to bake generic agents for any folder.

Previously this was only (and always) done for the root folder (usually called <i>Main</i>).
All rules that match the root folder without any host condition where used to create an agent configuration.
The resulting agent package was refered to as "<i>GENERIC</i>".

The same logic can now be used to bake a generic agent for any other folder.

To activate this users can check the box "<i>Bake agent packages</i>" in the folders settings.
An generic agent is then created for this very folder (not for its children), even if the folder is empty.
The default behaviour is unchanged, only the root folders package will be created.

As a side effect, the names on the download pages are changed from

<pre>
  GENERIC, VANILLA, MyHost1, MyHost2
</pre>

to

<pre>
  Vanilla (factory settings)
  Folders: / (root folder)
  Hosts: MyHost1, MyHost2
</pre>

In the REST API users can download these generic agents by setting <tt>agent_type='generic'</tt> and adding the <i>folder_name</i> field to the request.
Omiting the <i>folder_name</i> will default to the generic agent of the root folder, to provide compatibility.
