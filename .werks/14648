This werk only affects users with custom bakery plugins that have not been migrated to the new plugin API (introduced in Checkmk version 2.0).
As announced in Werk #11401 the support for legacy bakery plugins (used in Checkmk version 1.6 and earlier) is now dropped.
To see if this affects you, you can grep for the string "<tt>bakery_info[</tt>" in your <i>local/share/checkmk</i> folder.

Help on how to migrate these plugins can be found in the "<i>Plugin API reference</i>" section of the sites help menu.
