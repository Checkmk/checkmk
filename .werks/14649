This feature affects users that maintain a distributed setup where not all sites run the same Checkmk version.
Users can now simultaneously manage conflicting MKPs for different Checkmk versions.

MKPs that are uploaded to a site can now have one of three states:

<b>Available:</b>
The MKP is uploaded to the site.
It is not even unpacked, it just sits on disk.
Every MKP will be shown in this list, regardles of its deployment status.
From here you can download or delete it.

<b>Active on this site:</b>
The MKP is installed, and the code distributed with it is currently active on this site.

<b>Enabled (inactive on this site):</b>
This is the bit that is new.
There are reasons why we may not be able to install an MKP: It might not be suitable for this Checkmk version, or collide with another package.
In this case, the MKP is marked as <i>"enabled"</i>, but it is not installed.
In a distributed setup this information is passed to the remote sites.

During a version upgrade or after a new configuration has been pushed to a remote site, every site re-evaluates all enabled (and active) MKPs.
The outdated ones are disabled, and all applicable ones are installed.
This way users can maintain MKPs for different Checkmk versions providing the same functionality.
