We recently observed problems on Checkmk appliances caused by the agent mounting volumes.

This was in turn caused by the section responsible to output the statistics created by the <tt>mk-job</tt> wrapper.

For every existing <tt>/var/lib/check_mk_agent/job/[USER]</tt> folder, the agent started a login shell for <i>USER</i>.
This in turn made systemd automatically mount a volume under certain circumstances.

The agents use of <tt>su</tt> was a measure to prevent symlink and hardlink attacks -- this is now done differently, without the use of <tt>su</tt>.
