We are using MIB ".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0" to detect if the device is from cisco, by looking if
the words "cisco" and "ios" are present. To check if SLA is enabled we check ".1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.42.1.2.2.1.37.*"
This should work for devices than the previous three we explicitely checked for: ciscoISR4331, ciscoC891FK9, cat3560cG8TC.
