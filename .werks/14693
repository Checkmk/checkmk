In case of failover, a clustered check showed "Item not found in monitoring data"
instead of fetching the data from the second node.
The problem was that the service was discovered on a particular node within
the cluster and expected to persist on this node, instead of being fetched from
other nodes in the event that a failover had occurred.

This behavior was visible when the rule "Aggregation options for clustered services"
was set on "Failover".
