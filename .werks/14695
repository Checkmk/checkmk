It's now possible to monitor Azure Traffic Manager in Checkmk.
Two new checks have been added:
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager: Qps</li>
<li>Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager: Probe State</li>
</ul>
The new services will be automatically discovered if you have
an Azure Traffic Manager Profile in the resource group already
monitored in Checkmk.
