It's now possible to monitor Azure Load Balancer in Checkmk.
Three new checks have been added:
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Azure Load Balancer: Byte Count</li>
<li>Microsoft Azure Load Balancer: Health</li>
<li>Microsoft Azure Load Balancer: SNAT Consumption</li>
</ul>
The new services will be automatically discovered if you have
an Azure Load Balancer in the resource group already monitored
in Checkmk.
