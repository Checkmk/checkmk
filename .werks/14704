Until now, the mk_mysql agent plugin could handle multiple sockets,
but without the possibility to specify one alias per socket.
Specifying multiple sockets and one alias for the whole instance would
lead to missing services in the discovery.
The option to configure multiple sockets was missing from the bakery.

Now, the mk_mysql agent plugin can handle multiple socket-alias pairs
which can be configured through the bakery.
The configuration example mysql.cfg has been added to Setup > Agents >
Other operating systems > Example Configurations.
