This is relevant for the users of AIX, FreeBSD, HPUX, MacOS,
NetBSD and OpenBSD agents.

In version 2.1.0, asynchronous execution of MRPE isn't supported
for the above mentioned agents.
Prevously, if the option 'Asynchronous execution' of the agent
rule 'Execute MRPE checks' was enabled, the agents wouldn't output
MRPE data at all.
Now, the agents run the MRPE command synchronously and output the
data correctly.
