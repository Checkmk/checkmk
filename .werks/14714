During registration, the agent controller (<tt>cmk-agent-ctl</tt>) queries the port on which the
agent receiver is listening from the Checkmk REST API, unless the port has been explicitly provided
on the command line. Before this werk, this call to the REST API did not respect the
<tt>--detect-proxy</tt> option, wich enables the detection and usage of sytem proxy settings.

Note that this werk does not change the default behavior, which is to connect directly without any
proxy server.
