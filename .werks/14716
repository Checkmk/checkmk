This werk only affects users of non-Checkmk local customizations (single files and MKPs from non-
Checkmk sources such as the Checkmk exchange).

Two monolithic files under <tt>cmk/gui/plugins/wato/</tt> have been split up into multiple smaller
files:

LI: <tt>datasource_programs.py</tt>, which defined rules for configuring special agents, has been refactored into the folder <tt>datasource_programs</tt>.
LI: <tt>active_checks.py</tt>, which defined rules for configuring active checks, has been refactored into the folder <tt>active_checks</tt>.

Hence, any customization containing imports from any of the two dissolved files has to be
adjusted. The new import paths are probably
<tt>cmk.gui.plugins.wato.datasource_programs/active_checks.common</tt>.

Note that this only affects non-Checkmk customizations because as of the writing of this werk, any
customization produced by Checkmk will be obsolete with Checkmk 2.2.
