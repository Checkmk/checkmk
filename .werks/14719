This werk only affects users of non-Checkmk local customizations (single files and MKPs from non-
Checkmk sources such as the Checkmk exchange).

Before this werk, the Checkmk codebase offered two convenience functions for creating
<tt>ValueSpecs</tt> for passwords (either entered directly or selected from the password store):
<tt>IndividualOrStoredPassword</tt> and <tt>PasswordFromStore</tt>. These two functions had
misleading names and were therefore renamed:

LI: <tt>IndividualOrStoredPassword</tt> was renamed to <tt>MigrateToIndividualOrStoredPassword</tt>,
because this actually reflects what the returned <tt>ValueSpec</tt> does: It allows users to either
directly enter a password or select one from the store. Furthermore, it also handles legacy
configurations which did not offer the option to use the password store.
LI: <tt>PasswordFromStore</tt> was renamed to <tt>IndividualOrStoredPassword</tt>, which also
reflects its purpose: either directly enter a password or to select one from the store, but without
the handling of legacy configurations.

To stay compatible, we recommend to simply use <tt>IndividualOrStoredPassword</tt> instead of
<tt>PasswordFromStore</tt> in Checkmk 2.1 customizations, which will continue working when upgrading
to 2.2.

Note that this only affects non-Checkmk customizations because as of the writing of this werk, any
customization produced by Checkmk will be obsolete with Checkmk 2.2.
