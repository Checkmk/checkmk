Title: Fix "Percentage of service problems" dashlet in custom dashboards

Depending on the current configuration, the dashlet <i>Percentage of service problems</i> reported
"Sorry, you cannot create combined graphs for more than 100 objects"
when used in custom dashboards. This regression was introduced with werk <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/14423">#14423</a>.

Note that this werk only affects custom dashboards, not builtin dashboards such as the main
dashboard. It is possible that werk #14423 results in the error message also being displayed in the
main dashboard, on which this werk has no impact. Note that this probably means that the
<i>Percentage of total service problems</i> graph in the main dashboard was showing wrong values
prior to werk #14423.
