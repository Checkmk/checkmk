Title: super_server: Reenable "Checkmk agent network service (Linux)" ruleset

This is a regression since Checkmk 2.1.

The agent package install scripts didn't recognize the <tt>/etc/check_mk/super_server.cfg</tt>
correctly. As a result, the super server, if configured other than "auto",
wasn't set correctly.

In order to apply this fix, an agent update or reinstallation has to be done on
affected hosts.
