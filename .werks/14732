Title: cmk-update-agent: Retry locking

The agent updater is designed to have no more than one instance running
at a time on a host. This is implemented by holding a file lock while running.

We recently observed that a lock may sometimes fail briefly after it was
released by a previous agent updater instance, possibly due to some anti virus
software.

To mitigate this situation, the locking is now retried 10 times before aborting
the agent updater call.
