The agent updater comes with a systemd timer unit that invokes cmk-update-agent minutely
in order to check for a pending installation.

We now prevent the timer (or more precisely: the corresponding service unit) from writing
status messages on every start and stop to journalctl.

A detailed log can already be found at /var/lib/check_mk_agent/cmk-update-agent.log
