During agent package installation on Linux (.rpm or .deb package),
some shell scripts get executed that are located under the directory
<tt>/var/lib/cmk-agent</tt>.

This lead to problems, because on some environments, the /var directory
is mounted with noexec-flag and hence the scripts failed to execute.

To fix this situation, the installation scripts now get executed by
passing them to <tt>/bin/sh</tt>.
