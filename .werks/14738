With the ruleset "Installation paths for agent files", you can choose non-default installation
directories for the Checkmk agent, including the path for executables.

While the chosen executable path should be in the <tt>PATH</tt> environment variable of target
systems, this is not guaranteed.
Previously, if it failed to be in the <tt>PATH</tt> within the context of the agent installation/update
with dpkg or rpm, the installation scripts failed to find the command <tt>cmk-agent-ctl</tt>, which
resulted in an inconsistent agent setup.

This situation is now fixed by executing the agent controller by its full (custom) path on agent
installation/update.

Please note that the affected script <tt>/var/lib/cmk-agent/super-server/setup deploy</tt> won't
be able to find the custom executable directory when called manually, so it will fall back to
<tt>/usr/bin/cmk-agent-ctl</tt> or just <tt>cmk-agent-ctl</tt>.
