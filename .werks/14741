If hosts were moved between folders, the audit log uses the ID of the folder.

This could lead to unclear log entries if folder were renamed in the past,
because the ID does not change on folder renaming.

We now added the internal ID of the folder for a better understanding of this
log entries.

For example:

"Moved host from "Main directory" (ID: 21016475a7554c11afca66ae620b4c52) to
"myfolder1/myfolder2" (ID: fffa1507d66248cd9da17ac3cc5103d5)"
