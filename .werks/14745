The event console can send notifications with the option "Send monitoring
notification" in an event console rule enabled.

If such rule matched and a notification rule with bulk enabled matched that
notification, the notification result could contain, in addition to successful
processing, the entry "Data: b''". This happend if no graph could be found for
the host or service of the notification.

This problem exists at least since version 1.6.

Also a traceback with multiple exceptions was shown in ~/var/log/web.log.
