If the inpage search on the page "Setup" - "Hosts" was used and the display
options "Show host tags" and/or "Show explicit host labels" were enabled, the
search result returned all hosts.

A workaround was to use the "... (show all)" link in the "Tags" column after
the search result returned. This only returned the matched hosts.
