In the event that the SAP Hana host is in a timezone other than UTC, the
"fileinfo" check could crash reading the error message "ValueError (Cannot
render negative timespan)". This has been fixed. If you require this fix,
please deploy the agent plugin "mk_sap_hana" to the affected hosts.

The problem was that the modified timestamp of the files was incorrectly
converted from local time to UTC. In addition, the reference timestamp (current
time) used to calculate file age was determined before the modified timestamp
of the SAP Hana files was collected. This could lead to a scenario in which the
reference timestamp was older than the modified time of the files.
