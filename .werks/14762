This fix only applies when your PostgreSQL server runs under Linux.

The plugin "mk_postgres.py" does not find any instances when PostgreSQL version >=
13 is installed. This has been fixed. If you require this fix, please update
the agent plugin "mk_postgres.py" on the relevant host.

The problem was that in this version, the output of the "ps" command does not
include the full path to the relevant binaries, and therefore they could not be
correctly identified as PostgreSQL processes. For example:<br>
<br>
[PID] /usr/bin/postmaster [OPTS]  -->  [PID] postmaster [OPTS]
<br>
