The plugin "mk_mongodb.py" provides the section "mongodb_replica", which
contains information on the MongoDB primary, secondaries, and arbiters. The
primary host was listed as both primary and active secondary. This is also
shown in the corresponding check, "mongodb_replica". This has been fixed.

The fix requires that the agent plugin, "mk_mongodb.py", is updated on the
relevant hosts.
