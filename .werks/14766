The agent plugin "mk_mongodb.py" creates the section "mongodb_instance". In
some cases, this section contains information from a different host (i.e.
replica) from within the MongoDB cluster than the one on which the agent plugin
is located. The problem was that the connection settings did not specify to
connect to the host directly. Therefore, requests were distributed across the
cluster by MongoDB. This has been fixed. If this fix is required, the agent
plugin must be redeployed to the hosts.
