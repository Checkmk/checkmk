If you require this fix, you must reinstall the agent plugin "mssql.vbs" on the
relevant hosts.

Please note that applying this fix could lead to vanished services. If this is
the case, it makes sense to remove them from your monitoring, as these services
belong to a different database and have been falsely created. You can find
detailed error messages in the host's agent output.

In some settings the user that is used to run queries against the various
databases on a MSSQL server does not have access rights to query all databases.
This could lead to data from a different database shown for any database that
the user could not query.

Known services affected by this error:

LI: tablespaces
LI: transactionlogs
LI: datafiles
LI: clusters

The problem was that the error after attempting to switch to a different
database was not captured, and it was assumed to be successful. Instead, the
subsequent query was run against the database the user could last switch to.

If you would like to give the user extended access rights to query all
databases, please read the article at https://kb.checkmk.com/x/pAKqAg

We have introduced a more consistent way to perform queries against the system
and handle any errors.
