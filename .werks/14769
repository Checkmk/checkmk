It is possible to configure whether local extensions (MKPs) and Event Console
rules should be synchronised between the central and the remote sites in a
distributed monitoring set-up (configurable via Setup -> General -> Distributed
monitoring).

The site synchronisation between the central and any remote sites sporadically
ignored the respective site synchronisation settings. This has been fixed.
