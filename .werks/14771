Title: Fix ping endpoint for InfluxDB
Class: fix

The InfluxDB connector checks whether a connection is possible over
the "ping" endpoint.

Before, the connector erroneously used the /api/v2/ping endpoint, which
has stopped working in recent versions of the API.  Now, it correctly
uses the documented /ping endpoint.
