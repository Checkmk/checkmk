This removes the following graphs from the OMD Performance page:
Number of metrics received; Performance data loss for "connection";
Bytes sent to the "connection", where "connection" is either RRD,
InfluxDB or Carbon.

These graphs are always monotonically increasing and do not
provide any useful information.
