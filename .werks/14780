The thresholds for the metrics Carbon Overflows Rate, Carbon
Queue Usage, InfluxDB Overflows Rate, InfluxDB Queue Usage, RRD
Overflows Rate, and RRD Queue Usage would unnecessarily set the
OMD Performance service in WARN or CRIT. These metrics are used
mostly internally and are of lesser importance to the end users.
Therefore, the thresholds and their configuration are now
removed entirely.

These thresholds will be removed from the configuration after
an update.
