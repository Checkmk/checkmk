You're affected by this werk if you're monitoring MariaDBs with mk_mysql.vbs and you've given a customized service name.
Perviously, the Windows Service was only detected, if it contained the "MariaDB" suffix.
Now Windows Services containing the substring "MariaDB" will be detected (e.g. "MariaDB 10.4.25").
