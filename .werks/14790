You're affected if you're using mk_oracle for linux and the oracle version 12.1.0.1 (SE One).
The agent plugin may output something like:

<tt>
   ,vp.block_size pblock_size, vp.recovery_status precovery_status
                               *
ERROR at line 28:
ORA-00904: "VP"."RECOVERY_STATUS": invalid identifier
<\tt>

Background information:
<ul>
<li> the oracle version 12.1.0.1 (SE One) is missing the recovery_status, see https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/REFRN/GUID-A399F608-36C8-4DF0-9A13-CEE25637653E.htm#fnsrc_d1698612e372
<li> this version of oracle shouldn't be used anymore in production as it is EOL
<li> for installations which are still using this version, we're now falling back to a supported query
</ul>
