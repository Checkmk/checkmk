This werk is relevant for you if:
<ul>
<li> you implemented a host label function that is configurable via WATO
<li> you do not have a discovery function that uses the same ruleset
</ul>

Previously, this was not possible. You may have encountered the following error:

C+:
Error running automation call restart (exit code 1), error:
Invalid configuration variable 'YOUR_RULESET'
--> Found 1 invalid variables
If you use own helper variables, please prefix them with _.
C-:

Anyway - this is fixed now.
