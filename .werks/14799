This regression exists since 2.1.0p19 and broke the <tt>pip3</tt> command due to a wrong shebang.
C+:
OMD[stable_p20]:~$ pip3
bash: /omd/sites/stable_p20/bin/pip3: /bin/python: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
C-:

As of <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/14792">Werk 14792</a>, a workaround was to use pip as a module.
Please note that you would need to specify the installation target if you want the mkp tool to find your local packages:
C+:
OMD[stable_p21]:~$ python3 -m pip install --target local/lib/python3/ cx_Oracle
Collecting cx_Oracle
...
Installing collected packages: cx_Oracle
Successfully installed cx_Oracle-8.3.0
C-:

With this werk, <tt>pip3</tt> can be used again which automatically sets the installation target to the correct folder.
