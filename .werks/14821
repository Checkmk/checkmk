This werk only affects users of non-Checkmk custom extensions (single files and MKPs from non-
Checkmk sources such as the Checkmk exchange).

Before this werk, the Checkmk codebase offered the <tt>ValueSpec</tt> subclass <tt>Transform</tt>,
which was used for two things:

LI: Changing the format in which configured values are stored (<tt>back</tt> and <tt>forth</tt> specified).
LI: Updating legacy configurations to the current format (<tt>forth</tt> only specified).

As of this werk, the <tt>Transform</tt> class should only be used for the first point above
(changing the storage format). It now expects two arguments <tt>to_valuespec</tt> (previously
<tt>forth</tt>) and <tt>from_valuespec</tt> (previously <tt>back</tt>). <tt>back</tt> and
<tt>forth</tt> are still accepted as arguments and work as before. However, <tt>back</tt> and
<tt>forth</tt> will be removed in a future version and <tt>to/from_valuespec</tt> will become mandatory.

For updating legacy configurations, use the new <tt>Migrate</tt> class, which requires a mandatory
<tt>migrate</tt> argument. This is the equivalent of specifying <tt>forth</tt> only in the
<tt>Transform</tt> class.
