This werk only affects developers of custom extensions to Checkmk.

The variable <tt>cmk.gui.config.builtin_role_ids</tt>, which specifies IDs for built-in user roles,
has been split into two new variables:

LI: <tt>cmk.gui.config.default_authorized_builtin_role_ids</tt>: IDs of built-in user roles which
are by default authorized to use dashlets, sidebar snapins etc., unless explicitly specified
differently (at the moment admin, user, guest).
LI: <tt>cmk.gui.config.default_unauthorized_builtin_role_ids</tt>: IDs of built-in user roles which
are by default <i>not</i> authorized to use dashlets, sidebar snapins etc., unless explicitly
specified differently.

Note that <tt>builtin_role_ids</tt> still exists (still containing all built-in role IDs), however,
most developer will likely want to use <tt>cmk.gui.config.default_authorized_builtin_role_ids</tt>
in the future to avoid unwanted authorizations of new user roles added to
<tt>default_unauthorized_builtin_role_ids</tt>.

Alternatively, you may explicitly declare the roles you want to permit by default using
<tt>["admin", "user", "guest"]</tt>.
