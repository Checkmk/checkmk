When rendering graphs, Checkmk computes suitable steps for the ticks on the time axis based on the
current zoom level. However, this computation did not take into account shifts in local time zones,
such as switches from European summer to European winter time.

For example, a suitable step size might be one day. Usually, this would correspond to 24 hours,
unless the local time zone shifts in between. Before this werk, Checkmk did not take such shifts
into account. In European time, this led to for example the 30th of October 2022 being shown twice
as a time axis label (since 00:00h on the 30th and 00:00h on the 31st of October 2022 are 25 hours
apart).

As of this werk, Checkmk takes such local shifts into account. Hence, eg. the 30th of October 2022
is now represented by 25 hours on the time axis and the 27th of March by 23 hours (according to the
time zone configured on the Checkmk server rendering the Checkmk UI.).
