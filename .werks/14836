Previously the cluster property was added in any case even if the newly
computed tree was empty (ie. no data or inventory plugins did not add any
entries).

This led to a rather confusing result message of the {{HW/SW Inventory}}
service: {{Cannot update tree, Found 1 inventory entries, Got no data, ...}}.

Moreover there was no possibility for removing the {{HW/SW Inventory}} tree at
all, ie. the icon {{Show hardware/software inventory of this host}} in the
dropdown menu of the {{HW/SW Inventory}} stays all the time.

Now the mechanism works as follows:
LI: Apply all related inventory plugins
LI: Apply configured retention intervals
LI: If the tree is not empty then set the cluster property and store the tree.
LI: Otherwise remove the icon which means: no current inventory tree

Note: The retention intervals worked incidentally before because the tree never
was empty. Thus they were always applied.
