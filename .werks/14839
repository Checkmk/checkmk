Title: oracle_dataguard_stats: Bufix for wrong Recovery Status on RAC Standby
Class: fix

The check results in false CRITs on RAC standby databases with multiple running
instances.  Some more changes are done, due to wrong design in old code.

The option to monitor the MRP process has been removed, because it is not
needed. The apply_lag is more important than the recovery process itself.  If
recovery has been stopped, the monitoring of apply_lag will lead to WARN/CRIT,
which is the most important metric in a Data-Guard environment.

BREAKING Change:
The option mrp state has been removed, because it is not needed. A missing
recovery process (MRP0) is not an issue, until the apply_lag has a proper
WARN/CRIT definition - that is more important than a stopped recovery in the
standby database.

You have to re-install the agent plugin "mk_oracle".
