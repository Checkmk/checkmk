Until now mk_logwatch plugin could not create a directory for batch 
files because the directory name as a rule contained a colon and the 
colon is a forbidden symbol in NTFS. Due to this bug the logwatch 
monitoring was impossible.

With this version mk_logwatch plugin replaces the colon in directory 
name with an underscore thus fixing the regression.
