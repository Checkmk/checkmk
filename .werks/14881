It's now possible to use "WARN" - "WARN", "CRIT" - "CRIT" and "UNKNOWN" -
"UNKNOWN" in the alert handler rule option "Match service event type".

Alert handler rely on the last soft state, so this states are needed, e.g. if
you would like to create a rule that should match a WARN state on the second
check attempt.
