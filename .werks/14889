Until now, the concept of user management in distributed setups was that the
central site was responsible to keep track of the known users and pushed the
config to the remote sites.

This leeds to the problem, that users on remote sites with an own LDAP
connector configured were deleted on every activation of changes.

We now skip this users for deletion on activation, so the remote site is
responsible for users who are synchronized via the configured LDAP connection.

Please note that these kind of users are still not visible/usable in the setup
of the central site. You can e.g. not select them in rules like notification
rules. But this was also the case before.
