If you added a dashlet, via "Link to existing view" to a dashboard (e.g. the
"events" view) and configured a "Log Entry" filter, the shown dashlet always
used the defined filter of the source view, ignoring the configured options of
the dashlet.

Other views/filters used as linked view dashlet may also be affected because of
the former order of context processing.
