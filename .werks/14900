This werk adjusts the menu entries in "Display" when viewing views.
Until now it was not really visible to users if they edited views of other users
(this needs the permission "Edit foreign views").

The menu entries, shown if you visit a view, were adjusted as follows:

* "Clone builtin view" for builtin views
* "Edit my view" for customized views of the current user
* "Clone view" for views of other users (without permission "Edit foreign views")
* "Edit view of user X" and "Clone view" for views of other users (with permission)

The last mentioned example should give users the option to optional make a copy
of the current view instead of editing the view of another user.
