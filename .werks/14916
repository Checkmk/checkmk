Title: Do not log host secret
Class: security
Compatible: incomp
Component: agents

Version: 2.0.0p30


When using the <i>Agent updater</i> the Checkmk server needs a secret in order to allow the agent to download new agents.
For security reasons this secret is unique for each host and generated with the <tt>cmk-update-agent register</tt> command.
Unfortunately the generated host secret was written to the cmk-update-agent.log.
This logfile is not protected and usually world-readable.

With this secret one can download the current agent from the Checkmk server.
Included in that agent package are the plugin configs which can contain other secrets. (e.g. database credentials)

Mitigations without updateing:

LI: Reregister the agent-updater. Then sanitize the cmk-update-agent.log files.
LI: If you cannot rule out that any unauthorized user read <tt>/var/lib/check_mk_agent/cmk-update-agent.log</tt> respectively <tt>C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\log\cmk-update-agent.log</tt> you should rotate all secrets that might be or were included in the agent configurations.

Steps needed with the update:

LI: Update your agent.
LI: Reregister the agent-updater.
