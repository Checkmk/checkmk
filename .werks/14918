With this Werk we change the base image of the Checkmk docker container from Debian buster to Ubuntu jammy.

Ubuntu jammy has more up to date packages.
This should reduce the amount of "vulnerabilities" found in the docker container by ~90%.

Please note that these vulnerabilities are either fixed by a backport of the fix or the configuration did not allow a exploitation.
The packages in the container were updated whenever a new container was build.
Unfortunately not all vulnerability-scanners were able to recognise this.

To our knowledge none of the vulnerabilities were exploitable.
We rate this with a CVSS of 0 (None) (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N).
This CVSS is primarily meant to please automatic scanners.
