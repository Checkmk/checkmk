OpenSSL uses the openssldir option at compile-time for the default config paths.
Since every site has its own configuration the openssldir cannot be set to the correct location.

In order to have use the same truststore as the site when using openssl from the commandline the <tt>SSL_CERT_FILE</tt> variable is now set to <tt>var/ssl/ca-certificates.crt</tt> for the site user.
So if not specified otherwise the <tt>openssl</tt> command, run as site user, uses the same truststore as Checkmk.
