Previously to this Werk an attacker could utilize a cross site request forgery vulnerability in Checkmk to add elements to visuals (e.g. dashboards, reports, etc.).

This vulnerability was identified through a commissioned penetration test conducted by SSE – Secure Systems Engineering GmbH (Jan Hörsch).

<b>Mitigations:</b>
If you are unable to update in a timely manner you could remove the permission <tt>Customize dashboards and use them</tt> and <tt>Customize reports and use them</tt> from the used roles. So the users and admins cannot edit dashboards and reports anymore.
