In werk 12928 we updated the structure of the rules for the
"Size, age and count of file groups" enforced service (fileinfo_groups
and sap_hana_fileinfo_groups) but we didn't migrate the group patterns
that were defined in the "File Grouping Patterns" rules into the new
rule structure.

This werk will automatically handle this migration but there is a corner
case that can't be handled automatically: this happens if you have more
than one file group with the same group name across all your
"File Grouping Patterns" rules.

Example:
LI: A "File Grouping Patterns" rule that applies on "folder1" and defines
the "group1" file group with an include pattern of "/path/to/group1/*"
LI: A "File Grouping Patterns" rule that applies on "Main Folder" and
defines the "group1" file group with an include pattern of
"/a/different/path/*"

In that case a manual intervention is needed: you need to delete one of
the 2 "group1" definitions and just keep one of them.
If need to keep both groups, you can rename them differently and
manually edit the "Size, age and count of file groups" enforced services
to point to the newly named group.

After this manual fix, the migration will work as expected.
