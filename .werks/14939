This werk adds the AWS/SNS check.

With this check you can monitor the following SNS metrics:

LI: For each SNS topic: published messages, delivered and failed notifications.
LI: For each AWS region: month-to-date SMS spending and SMS success rate.

A new service will be created for each SNS topic and you can filter the
topics to monitor by topic name or by AWS tag.
Also 2 services will be created for each AWS region (SMS spending and
SMS success rate).
