Up to now, when using the agent updater CLI, you would have to use the
`--password` (or `-P`) parameter to specify the password for a human
user and the `--secret` (or `-S`) parameter to specify the secret for
an automation user.

This starts to be confusing with the interactive mode: in that case the
program assumes that you are using a human user and will fail if the
credentials that you enter are valid credentials for an automation user.
On top of that, the error message is completely misleading.

With this commit, we are changing the behavior of the agent updater so
that an automation user credentials will work even if the secret is
specified with the `--password` (or `-P`) param.

This way the end user don't have to care about which param name is the
right one to use: they can just specify the password, or the secret,
with the `--password` param and it will work.
This also allows the interactive mode to work with an automation user.

This change is backward compatible, meaning that everything that used to
work up until now, will keep working even after this.
