Previously, if for some reason a plugin sent a malformed UTF-8 string, 
it broke the integrity of state.pb and resulted in the loss of the state 
data. This behavior is explained by the fact that the Protobuf API 
allows to write incorrect UTF-8 strings, but does not allow to read them.

This issue has been resolved in this release.
