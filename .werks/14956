When configuring the mk_logwatch agent plugin, it's possible to specify the file
matching patterns more precisely by defining a regular expression pattern within
the applying options.
You can choose among the keywords <tt>regex</tt> or <tt>iregex</tt> for a case
sensitive or insensitive matching, respectively.

While this option already exists for a long time, it can now be specified via
agent bakery by configuring the "Text logfiles" agent rulespec.
