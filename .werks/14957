When monitoring files/filegroups with service monitoring rules <i>Size and age of single files</i>
or <i>Size, age and count of file groups</i> (i.e., all services basing on the <i>fileinfo</i>
agent section, not on the mk_filestats agent plugin), the service evaluation could fail with a crash
report containing the error "Cannot render negative timespan".

This happened very rarely, and if it did, it was temorary (for one check period).

Since the fix consists of a change in the agent section evaluation, you'll have to update agents
to apply it on affected systems.
