When installing an RPM agent package including the agent controller
(prepackaged agent package or agent bakery package), running the <tt>cmk-agent-ctl</tt>
executable did fail on some systems with active SELinux.
This lead to an installation without active controller, and thus without TLS encryption.

Affected systems include, but are not limited to, RHEL9 and derivates.

The root cause for this problem was that the controller was shipped as a UPX-compressed
executable, which required text-relocation on execution. Further details can be found at
this forum discussion: https://forum.checkmk.com/t/cmk-agent-ctl-segmentation-fault-on-rocky-linux-9/34909

To fix this problem, we now avoid to compress the agent controller with UPX. Instead, the
cmk-agent-ctl executable is shipped as a gzip-archive and gets uncompressed on package
installation.

You can fix your existing agent installations by updating with a new agent package. With activated
automatic updates, this should happen automatically after baking agents.
