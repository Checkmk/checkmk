Within the ruleset "Checkmk agent installation auditing", it's possible for some time
to configiure the state that is reported if the host queried the server for an agent update,
but agent updates are globally disabled.

With this Werk, it's also possible to configure the state for hosts that are rejected by the
setting "Selection of hosts to activate agent updates for".

Please note that this new setting will only apply if agent updates are globally enabled, as
the agent bakery will not check the abovementioned host selection otherwise, hence no error
will be reported for the host being rejected.
