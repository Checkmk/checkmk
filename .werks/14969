This werk only affects maintainers of custom special agents:
Previously, when an error occurred when executing a special agent, the first exception line was displayed in the service summary of the <i>Check_MK</i> service.
Since the last line is usually the most recent message, e.g. when displaying traceback, this werk changes the summary to be the last line.
