This werk affects the monitoring of one or more PostgreSQL instances via agent plugin on linux if the changes made in werk #14975 are applied.
The agent plugin will look for the "psql" binary under the path <tt>/{pg_database}/{pg_version}/bin/{binary_name}</tt>, using the configured values in the .env and .pgpass files.
However, this path does not have to be correct, depending on the setup. In case it cannot be found the binary location from PATH is now used instead.

In order to apply this change you will need to reinstall the agent plugin.
