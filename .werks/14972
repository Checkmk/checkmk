The agent plugin for Oracle on Windows, "mk_oracle.ps1", is able to connect to
multiple Oracle instances. If the plugin was configured to connect to these
instances with a specific user, the Oracle SID was not included in the settings
for TNS alias, which meant the plugin could not connect to the relevant
instances. This has been fixed.
