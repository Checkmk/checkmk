You are affected by this werk if you have configured one or more PostgreSQL
instances that should be monitored by an agent plugin of Checkmk version >
1.6.0. This means that you are using the rule "Instances settings" in the
ruleset "PostgreSQL database nd sessions (Linux, Windows)". In order to apply
this fix, the agent plugin must be reinstalled on the host.

When PostgreSQL instances are configured explicity via the respective .env and
.pgpass config files, the agent plugin was no longer able to determine the
correct "psql" binary to use in order to run SQL queries via the commandline.
This lead to an error message similar to:
<br>
psql: error: connection to server on socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.123"
failed: No such file or directory
<br>
This has been fixed.
