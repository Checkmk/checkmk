The SAML integration approach on Apache level based on mod_auth_mellon is
deprecated. In all Enterprise Editions of Checkmk, SAML is now configurable via
the Setup (see werk #14976 for details).

mod_auth_mellon continues to be available in Checkmk version 2.2.0, but will be
removed with version 2.3.0. If you would like to use this SAML configuration
approach in version 2.3.0 and beyond, mod_auth_mellon will need to be
installed. However, please note that support will be fully dropped in version
2.3.0.
