Encryption is currently not a supported security feature. However, Checkmk's
service provider metadata endpoint listed an empty entry for the encryption
certificate. This may cause issues with some identity providers, which flag the
metadata XML as malformed (e.g. NetIQ). This has been fixed by removing the
empty encryption certificate entry from the metadata.
