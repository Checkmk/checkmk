The <tt>mkp remove</tt> command (or <tt>cmk -P remove</tt>) has been fixed to reflect the recent changes in the GUI.
You can only remove <i>disabled</i> packages.

The 'disable' command to do this was intruced with 2.0.0p30, but defunct.
It is now fixed.

Since you can have different versions of the same package uploaded, you have to specify the version as well now:

<tt>mkp remove NAME VERSION</tt>
