This fixes the 'FileNotFoundError' that was encountered upon upgrade from Checkmk 2.1.0p16 to p17 or 2.0.0p30 to p31.

While this bug produces a nasty traceback during update, it is unlikely that users suffer any consequences.

You can safely ignore this issue, <b>unless</b> you have a distributed setup with deviating remote site versions and you want to have a different set of MKPs installed on them (depending on the remote sites version).

Since this feature is very new, it is unlikely that you are using it.

If it is the case however, you have to disable and re-enable the affected MKP on the central site.
You might still see this traceback during the sync to a remote sites with a higher version than the central site, but you can ignore it.

After upgrading to 2.0.0p32 or 2.1.0p17 there is nothing to be done.
