If users created or edited hosts or folders via the <b>Web</b>API and configured SNMP v3 credentials as list (as JSON would do) they ended up with disfunctional configurations.

With this werk both existing configurations and new incoming invalid values are fixed up automatically.

Needless to say that affected users should really migrate to the REST API!
