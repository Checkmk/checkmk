With werk #14759 we adjusted the calculation of stale services in the tactical
overview.

This werk now adjusts the link for this section to show the correct amount of
services in the view "Stale services".

Note:
This adds a new filter to the builtin view "Stale services" ("uncheckedsvc").
If you have customized the view before, please add the filter "Host states"
with checked "UP", "DOWN", "UNREACH" and "PEND" option to your custimzed view
or create a new clone of the builtin view and customize it as before.
