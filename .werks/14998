Title: Remove long deprecated flexible and plain email notifications
Class: feature
Compatible: incomp
Component: notifications

Knowledge: undoc
Level: 2
Version: 2.2.0b1

This change only affects you, in case you have set the global setting "Rule
based notifications" to "Off" in your installation.

Flexible and plain email notifications are deprecated since version 1.5.

If you still use flexible or plain email notifications configured within the
user profile, this werk will remove this notification option in the
usersettings and the GUI. Affected users will be logged to
~/var/log/update.log, e.g.:

"Removed notification configuration from user: MY_USER"

All listed users will automatically be updated to use the rule based
notifications. Effectively, the HTML email notifications will be enabled for
them. If you want to use a different notification mechanic, then review the
notification rules and update them according to your needs.

You can find more about the notification configuration
<a href='https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/notifications.html'>here</a>.

Still existing spool files will be converted to HTML email notifications on update.
If a remote site with a version prior 2.2 has flexible or plain email
notifications enabled and uses notification forwarding, the notifications will
be coverted to HTML email notifications on the recieving site.
