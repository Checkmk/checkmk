Since werk #14295 in version 2.1.0p14, some combined graphs showed an exception
like "Cannot render graph: host, service description or regex not found in
context".

A workaround was, to edit the content element and set the missing context
filter. Unfortunately, if you used host or service groups as filter, this
workaround didn't work.
