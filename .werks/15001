If a user saved a form dialog, it was possible, that this change was
not applied correctly. This situation could happen if a user had to many
browser tabs open or spent a lot of time for one configuration step on a page
before saving.

Background:
The maximal number of transaction IDs for a user was limited to 20 before this
werk. Also, the sidebar snapins "Site status", "Master control" and "Bookmarks"
used a new transaction ID on each reload of the sidebar.

The number of IDs per user is now increased to 30 and the mentioned sidebar
snapins no longer use transaction IDs.
