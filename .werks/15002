If you cloned a rule multiple times, from the second clone on, the "Based on
role" property had the default "Administrator", no matter what initial builtin
role was cloned.

The property will now always show the builtin role of the source role that was cloned.
E.g. if you clone "guest" multiple times, the clones will always show "Guest
user".
