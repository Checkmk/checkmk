If you added metrics via "Add all metrics of this graph to" - "New custom
graph..." an error like "Cannot load custom_graph from
/omd/sites/MYSITE/var/check_mk/web/MYUSER/user_custom_graphs.mk: invalid syntax
(<unknown>, line)" was shown.

We have seen this especially while adding CPU utilization metrics of windows
hosts.

A workaround was to edit the file
"/omd/sites/MYSITE/var/check_mk/web/MYUSER/user_custom_graphs.mk" and change
entries like "'help': l'CPU time spent in user space'" to "'help': 'CPU time
spent in user space'".
