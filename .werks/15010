This werk enables Checkmk to send notifications about changes in the states of
hosts and services to Microsoft Teams.

First, you need to setup a webhook to your team or space, see
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook" target="_blank">here</a>
, which will allow Checkmk to post messages. Next, in Checkmk, under "WATO -
Notifications", create a new notification rule. Select "Microsoft Teams" as the
notification method. Copy the URL of your webhook into the Webhook-URL field.
Optionally, if you want sent messages to include hyperlinks to Checkmk, enable
the field "URL prefix for links to Checkmk".
