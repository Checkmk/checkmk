When we send a notification email to a recipient that set an "out of office" reply an automatic response would be
created by the receiver. This is suppressed now. To achieve this notification emails now set the following headers.

LI: Auto-Submitted, see RFC 3834
LI: X-Auto-Response-Suppress, see MS Exchange documentation
