The proxmox agent would fail with a KeyError when a proxmox VE node was shutdown.

The error occured because a we do not get information for the timezone of shutdown
nodes. The timezone information is used to convert timestamps for backups to utc.
When no timezone information is found for a node we use the timezone of the first
node we process.
