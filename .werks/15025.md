For a dual stack host check mk will create *PING IPv4* and *Ping IPv6* services
automatically. Those services are created by the core configuration and cannot
be deactivated. With the CMC core two *Ping IPv4/6* services would appear on the
host, the nagios core ignores the user defined service. The core configuration now
only creates the respective PING service for the main interface of the host.

If you have a user defined *Ping IPv4/6* service it will replace the old auto
generated one with the next *Activate Changes*.
