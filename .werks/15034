Title: SNMPv3 contexts: reintroducing 'All SNMP sections' option
Class: fix

Previously, werk 11114 unintentionally removed the option from the
dropdown list which consequently led to an error when a user tried
to upgrade for example from the 1.6 to the 2.0 version. This werk
fixes this problem by reintroducing the option.
