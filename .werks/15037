The Windows agent plugin for monitoring Veeam jobs (<tt>veeam_backup_status.ps1</tt>) crashed if
there was a disabled CDP job on the target system. This has been fixed, hence, disabled jobs will
now be discovered as services in Checkmk. Their monitoring status is <i>OK</i> and they don't report
the time since the last CDP run, which is not available for disabled jobs.

Note that users have to update the agent plugin on affected hosts in order to benefit from this
werk.
