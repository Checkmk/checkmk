Title: Distributed configuration: Fix active Setup menu on remote site

On remote sites with enabled configuration replication which were one major version ahead of the
central site, the Setup menu was always active, even if <i>Disable remote configuration</i> was
selected in the central site. Hence, users could actively change the configuration, which was
however overwritten upon the next configuration synchronization with the central site.

Note that this issue also occured if a remote site running on the same major version as the central
site was updated to the next higher major version. In case the central site was updated as well (st.
both sites ran on the same major version again), the issue could be solved by activating changes
for the remote site in the central site for the first time after updating both sites.

This issue was present since 2.0.0p6 / 2.1.0.
