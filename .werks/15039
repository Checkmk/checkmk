Title: Distributed setup with 1.6 central site: Fix configuration connection
Class: fix

This issue only affects distributed setups with enabled configuration replication where the central
site still runs on Checkmk 1.6.

In such setups, the configuration synchronization was not fully functional. For example, even if
<i>Disable remote configuration</i> was selected in the central site, the Setup menu was still
active in the remote site. Hence, users could change the configuration, which was however
overwritten by the next configuration synchronization. Also the setting <i>Sync with LDAP
connections</i> was not applied correctly.

Note that this werks describes a different issue than the one described in <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/15038">werk 15038</a>,
with the same effects however.
