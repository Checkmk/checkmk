On SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP4 systems, the <tt>curl</tt> command crashed with
C+:
curl: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib64/libssh.so.4: undefined symbol: EVP_KDF_CTX_new_id, version OPENSSL_1_1_1d
C-:
when executed as a site user.

Note that this issue also prevented certain background tasks in Checkmk from being executed, such as
LDAP and Active Directory synchronizations or internal cleanup jobs.
