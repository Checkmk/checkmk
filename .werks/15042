When running in the Checkmk Appliance, the command line tool for administrating site backups also
listed system backups (<tt>mkbackup</tt> executed as a site user). This is no longer the case, since
system backups cannot be used for a site restore. This is consistent with the user interface, which
also lists site backups only.

Note that this does not impact the option use system backup targets for site backup jobs.
