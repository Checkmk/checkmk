When pressing <i>Show  all results</i> for a topic, the search will now display at maximum 80
results. In case more results are available, a corresponding message will be displayed. This can
improve the performance of scenarios where for example a large number of hosts is found for a given
search term.

Furthermore, showing more than 80 results is not helpful to the user. When hitting this limit, users
should either refine their search request or use a dedicated search dialog (such as the search
dialogs in the service monitoring rules or hosts pages).
