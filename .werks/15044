Title: Improve Setup search performance

When searching for `groups` or related search terms, the Setup search was slowed down by inefficient
permission checks for the host, service and contact group pages. These checks ensure that the host,
service and contact group pages are are only included in the search results if the current user is
allowed to see them. The permissions are now ensured more efficiently.

Note that this issue was resolved in <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/15041">werk 15041</a> for the
upcoming Checkmk version 2.2.
