When changing the password for an automation user the time of the last password change was not set.
If the global setting <i>Maximum age of passwords</i> was enabled and the password retired, the login was not possible even if the password was newly set.

When a automation user is forced to change the password (e.g. through Werk #14391), being set by an administrator was not honored.

This is now fixed.
