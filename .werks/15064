The agent updater now reports about the status of the trusted certificates for agent signatures.
The status of those certificates is then checked by the service <i>Check_MK Agent</i> as follows:

LI: Warn if a certificate is corrupt
LI: Warn if a certificate is not valid anymore
LI: Warn if a certificate is about to become invalid
LI: Crit if there is no trusted certificate
LI: Warn/Crit if there will be no valid cert in 90/30 days.
