So far, the check plugin postgres_version (services "PostgreSQL Version ...") reported versions of PostgreSQL instances. With this werk, we remove this plugin and instead report the version information in the plugin postgres_instances (services "PostgreSQL Instance ..."). This makes the monitoring of PostgreSQL more consistent with the monitoring of other databases such as Oracle.

Users should execute a service re-discovery on affected hosts to remove already discovered PostgreSQL version services.
