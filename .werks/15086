Inventory based views, ie. the data source is an inventory table, now offer the
possibility to join other inventory tables. This can be configured in the
related view editor dialog.

First you have to choose one or more so-called macros. These macros are based
on the columns of this data source and are used to identify a row besides other
identifiers like host name.

A macro is allowed to contain only ASCII upper letters, digits and underscores.
Macros for which a value is not found, won't be replaced by anything and stay
as they are.

Then these macros can be used for "Joined inventory columns" below
"Columns" in order to connect these tables. Note that these macros only make
sense for tables to be connected which also provide these columns.

Example:

<ul>
<li>Choose "Oracle instances" as the data source</li>
<li>Choose "SID" with "$SID$" below macros</li>
<li>Now you can connect "Oracle dataguard statistics > Name" where "SID"
equals "$SID$" below "match criteria"</li>
</ul>

Note:
Columns of the data source itself are available below "Column" - not
"Joined inventory columns".
