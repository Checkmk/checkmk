With werk 15086 different inventory tables can be joined. The configured macros
can now also be used in "Joined columns" in order to connect services with
the columns of this data source.

Example:

<ul>
<li>Choose "Oracle instances" as the data source</li>
<li>Choose "SID" with "$SID$" below macros</li>
<li>Now you can connect "Services: Summary" of the services "ORA $SID$ Uptime"
below "Joined column"</li>
</ul>
