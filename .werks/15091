Sometimes the full agent output, ie. the output of the agent itself and of all
installed agent plugins, of a host is needed for debugging or simulation
purposes.

Especially collecting the output of the agent plugin "mk_inventory" is not
very user-friendly because the execution depends on a special flag file. A user
has to delete or modified this flag file in order to get the output.
In general this intervention is not a good idea because it steps in the Checkmk
operations.

With the new option "--force-inventory" the output of "mk_inventory" is
collected and the Checkmk operations are not bothered anymore.

Example:
check_mk_agent --force-inventory > host.out
