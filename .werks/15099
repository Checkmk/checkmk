Previously, when doing a bulk_delete operation via the REST API,
an exception could occur under certain conditions, most notably
one where the DCD (Dynamic Configuration Daemon) is configured
to automatically delete hosts without piggyback data.

If the error occured, in the logs these lines are occuring:

<pre>
PermissionError: Required permissions not declared for this endpoint.
Endpoint: &lt;Endpoint cmk.gui.plugins.openapi.endpoints.host_config:bulk_delete&gt;
Permission: general.see_all
Used permission: {'wato.all_folders', 'general.see_all', 'wato.manage_hosts'}
Declared: AllPerm([{wato.manage_hosts}, {wato.all_folders}?)
</pre>

This werk fixes this problem.
