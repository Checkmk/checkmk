From Checkmk version 2.1 the <i>Check_MK</i> service crashed if the settings in <i>Hostname translation for piggybacked hosts</i> resulted in an empty host name.

The host name <tt>''</tt> is now replaced by <tt>'_'</tt>.
This is consistent with other invalid host names (such as <tt>'../../bin/pwn'</tt>), where the invalid characters are replaced by an underscore.
