The WATO configuration option <i>"State in case of empty output"</i> is dropped.

The feature did not work as intended since Checkmk version 2.0.
We now reviewed the feature to decide whether we want to repair or remove it.
In this case we felt that its small benefit does not justify the complexity it introduces into the codebase.

For the sake of simplicty and maintainability we remove the feature.

An empty output from a monitored host will always result in a CRIT state of the <i>Check_MK</i> service, which has always been the default.
