The output of the command line call <tt>mkp list</tt> (without arguments) has changed.

This change is only incompatible for users that use this output in a script.

The command previously only showed a list of all installed packages:

C+:
OMD[mySite]$ mkp list
my_package
C-:

It will now show a table of all known packages, much more similar to the <i>WATO</i> page in the GUI:

C+:
OMD[mySite]:~$ mkp list
Name            Version Title                 Author       Req. Version Until Version Files State
--------------- ------- --------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------- ----- -----------------------------
my_package      1.0     A test package        Checkmk GmbH 1.6.0        None          1     Enabled (active on this site)
another-package 1.0     A nother test package Checkmk GmbH 2.0.0        2.1.0         42    Enabled (inactive on this site)
C-:

This change was originally intended to be part of the 2.2 release.

However, up to now the `list` command was designed to only report on <b>installed</b> (active) packages.
In preparation for upgrades it might be helpful to see information on disabled or inactive packages, so we decided to bring this change to Checkmk version 2.1.
