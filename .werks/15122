You can now make customized views, dashboards, etc. available for users on
selected sites.

Therefore new permissions like "Publish views to users of allowed sites" are
introduced and assigned to the "admin" role.
With this permission you can use the option "Make this view available for other
users" - "Publish to users of sites" on the "Edit" page of the customization.

Please note that the customizations will be available on the selected sites
after the next activation of changes for these sites.
