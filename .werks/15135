This feature was requested via the feature portal:
https://features.checkmk.com/suggestions/297892/make-dashboards-also-mkpable

You now have the option to export views, dashboards and reports (so called
visuals). They can be downloaded, versioned, and shared with other Checkmk
installations.

The following example describes the new feature for views (it works the same
way for all types):

Users with permission "Manage Extension Packages (MKPs)" will see a new icon
for exporting the related view within "Customize" - "Views" for any none builtin
view.

If you use this icon, a new view will appear within the new section
"Extensions" and a file will be created within
'~/local/lib/check_mk/gui/plugins/views'.

Local files for dashboards will be stored in
'~/local/lib/check_mk/gui/plugins/view/dashboard', for reports they will be
stored in '~/local/lib/check_mk/gui/plugins/view/reports'.

With the 2 icons in the section "Extensions" you can go to the extension
package module and create an extension package or remove the related view from
the extension package page. The later will remove the file in the mentioned
local directory and the view from the "Extensions" section.

The "Extension" section also shows the state for each exported view, like "This
view can be packaged with the extension packages module." if the view was
exported and "This view is provided via the MKP 'MY_MKP'." if the view is part
of an installed extension package.

If the view is part of an extension package, you have the option to clone and
customize it.
