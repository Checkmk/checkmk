When querying logs from the Datadog API, there was a shift in the time window of the query. The
shift corresponded to the UTC offset of the local time zone of the monitoring server. This was
caused by misinterpreting local times as UTC times.

For example, if the local time zone of the monitoring server is CET, then there was a shift of one
hour into the future, causing the agent to query future logs. If the local time zone of the
monitoring server is UTC, there was no shift.
