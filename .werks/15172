In rare cases, the interface checks associated multiple interfaces with a given service item.
Depending on the exact plugin, this could lead to incorrect monitoring results (wrong data or
misleading failures in rate computations).

This happened if there was an interface where the combination of alias or description plus index
matched the alias or description (without the index) of another interface. For example, the
following combination lead to such as mixup:

LI: Item: `Ethernet 2`
LI: Interface 1: Index 1, Description `Ethernet 2`
LI: Interface 2: Index 2, Description `Ethernet`

In this case, Checkmk associated both interfaces with the item `Ethernet 2`, resulting in wrong
monitoring results.

Furthermore, another potential side effect of this issue was that the Perf-O-Meters of affected
services crashed with
C+:
Exception: list index out of range
C-:
