The service discovery for processes crashed if the agent output contained processes which have an
emtpy command line and exact process name matching was selected in the process discovery ruleset.

Processes with empty command lines can occur eg. on Linux systems (<tt>ps</tt> command) due
mandatory access control or in containerized environments.
