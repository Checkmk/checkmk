When configuring bandwidth levels, users previously configured

NL: Traffic direction: in / out / both
NL: Are the tresholds upper or lower thresholds?
NL: Threshold type: absolute / relative to interface speed / predictive
NL: Specific settings for selected threshold type

However, when selecting predictive levels, users had to again configure settings for upper and/or
lower thresholds. In this case, the outer setting (number 2 from the list above) had no effect.
Hence, the new configuration looks like this:

NL: Traffic direction: in / out / both
NL: Threshold type: absolute / relative to interface speed / predictive
NL: Specific settings for selected threshold type, including upper/lower setting
