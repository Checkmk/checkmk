This werk is only incompatible if you monitor logfiles containing non-ASCII characters with the
<tt>logwatch</tt> agent plugin.

As of this werk, the <tt>logwatch</tt> agent plugin always encodes its ouput in UTF-8. Before, the
encoding depended on the system settings.

This werk is marked as incompatible because it can have an unexpected side effect: On some systems,
users might now have to explicitly configure the encoding of the monitored log files. The reason for
this is that if not explicitly configured, the <tt>logwatch</tt> plugin tries to guess the encoding.
If the wrong encoding is guessed, log files are decoded incorrectly, however, before this werk, this
error might have cancelled out due to <tt>logwatch</tt> using the same encoding both for decoding
logfiles and encoding its output.

Since the latter is now always done using UTF-8, this cancellation will not happen anymore. If you
are affected by this, you will either see the replacement character `ï¿½` appearing in your log
messages or your log messages will contain random non-ASCII characters which do not make sense.

As a positive side effect, correcting this issue enables the matching of patterns containing non-
ASCII characters. Before, using the wrong encoding to decode the logfiles prevented this,
effectively leading to overlooked messages.
