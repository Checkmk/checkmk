In Checkmk 2.2.0 the use of certain special characters in user IDs is no longer allowed.
As a result, some user IDs that were previously valid in Checkmk version 2.1.0 will become invalid in version 2.2.0.
The validation affects both local users and users from external connections such as LDAP.
However, local users created in the Web UI are guaranteed to be compatible as the same restrictions were already applied there.

Since Checkmk 2.2.0 will not work if any incompatible user ID is present, <tt>omd update</tt> will look for them and abort if any incompatible user ID is found.

To be compatible with Checkmk version 2.2.0 please ensure that all user IDs adhere to the following restrictions:
The first character of a user ID must be a digit, a letter, an underscore (<tt>_</tt>), or a dollar sign (<tt>$</tt>).
The rest of the user ID may additionally contain dash (<tt>-</tt>), at (<tt>@</tt>), and dot (<tt>.</tt>).
