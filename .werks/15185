Previously, changing an automation user's authentication secret did not update the recorded timestamp of the last password change for the automation user.
As a result, the automation user could have been prevented from logging in by the password policy for local users, because the secret appeared to be too old.

The recorded timestamp is now updated when the secret is changed via the REST API.

Note that the issue did not affect changing an automation user's secret via the user management GUI (Setup > Users).
Here the timestamp was already updated correctly.
