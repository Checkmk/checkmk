Temporary files created by the agent bakery when baking agents are now no longer included in backups.
These files needlessly took up space in the backups, although they are not needed.
Specifically, this affects files in the directory <tt>var/check_mk/agents/.files_cache</tt>.

Baked agents are still included in backups.
