OpenSSL was updated to version 3.0.13.

OpenSSL 3 uses requirements regarding allowed configurations, such as allowed ciphers, renegotiation, and so on.
In some scenarios, this can break monitoring for hosts with TLS configurations that are no longer considered secure.
We have published a blog post to help you mitigate these issues, should they affect you: https://checkmk.com/blog/how-monitor-servers-broken-tls-checkmk.

To aid automated scanning we assign a CVSS score of 0.0 (None) (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N).
