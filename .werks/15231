The extension packages manager has been callable from the command line in three ways:
LI: <tt>cmk -P [arguments]</tt>
LI: <tt>check_mk -P [arguments]</tt>
LI: <tt>mkp [arguments]</tt>

We no longer support the first ones, and only keep the <tt>mkp</tt> command.
This unification reduces confusion, eases documentation, and increases maintainability.
