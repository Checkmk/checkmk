This Werk prevents an undesired SNMP scanning process during service discovery.

This additional scan increased the time the discovery took by a factor of two.
In addition, no progress was reported for the first of the scans, which could result in an apache timeout after 110 seconds.
In that case the message shown was
<i>
Your request timed out after 110 seconds.
This issue may be related to a local configuration problem or a request which works with a too large number of objects.
But if you think this issue is a bug, please send a crash report
