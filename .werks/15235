This fixes missing agent sections when users upgrade from a <b>1.6.0 systemd</b> Checkmk agent package to a <b>2.0.0 xinetd</b> package.
Since from 1.6.0 to 2.0.0 we changed the default network service <b>from xinetd to systemd</b>, this is a very rare scenario.

In case it did happen the systemd socket was not stopped during the upgrade, preventing the xinetd service from binding to the port.
This resulted in a partially working monitoring (as the systemd socked <i>was</i> running).

However, services using chached data would go to stale (e.g. <i>"NTP Time"</i>) and the agent updater would no longer be triggered.
