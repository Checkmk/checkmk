In some particular update scenario, users would see a message about 'messed up' RRD files:
<i>"RRD files for host myHost [...] are messed up. Please restore them both from backup."</i>
This case is now properly handled.

Users which are affected by the issue can execute the initial command again to get this fixed.

Technical details:
Older filesystem metrics have been created using the mount as metric name, leading to a lot of differently named metrics.
We have since changed the metric name to the predictable (and reusable) name 'fs_used'.
The migration failed in cases where for some reason both the old and the new metric are present.
In this case we now create the artificial metric <tt>fs_used_renamed_legacy_records</tt> from the old values, which will be prepended to the new metric to provide the full history of RRDs.
