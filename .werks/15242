The bulk discovery and periodic service discovery now fails if one (or more) of the configured data sources fail to fetch data.

If a data source fails, it will not produce any data.
This resulted in vanished (or missing) services.
If no data is fetched at all, the bulk discovery and periodic service discovery of a host would "successfully" discover zero services.
They now report a failure (for the affected host) in all of those cases.

Such a failure to fetch data can either be a temporary or a permanent problem.
If it is temporary we should retry later; if it is permanent user must fix their configuration.
Either way, there is no point in proceeding with the discovery, potentially removing services that should not be removed.
