Users of the Checkmk Cloud Edition can now create an agent package that will automatically add the host to the monitoring upon installation.

If monitoring site and agent package are configured accordingly, the agent controller will contact the (remote) monitoring site, and post a request for registration.
The (central) site will then process this request according to its configuration and potentially create a new host in the monitoring, discover the services and start monitoring it.

Details can be found in the <a href="https://docs.checkmk.com/2.2.0/en/hosts_autoregister.html">user manual</a>.
