Users of the Checkmk Cloud Edition now have a new mode of operation for the agent controller at their disposal:
The "<i>Push mode</i>".

In the push mode, the Checkmk agent sends the monitoring data to the Checkmk server once per minute.
The agent pushes the data transmission on its own and does not wait for a request from the server.
The push mode is always required if the Checkmk server cannot access the network in which the host to be monitored and its agent are located, for example, in a cloud-based configuration.

More on the setup can be found in our <a href="https://docs.checkmk.com/2.2.0/en/agent_linux.html">user manual</a>.
