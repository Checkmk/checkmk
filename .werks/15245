This only affects users that maintain a cluster where they cluster a service from only <i>some</i> of its nodes.

This is a regression introduced by <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/14693">Werk #14693</a> in Checkmk 2.1.0p11.
As a result of this setup the service in question would appear as UNKNOWN service on the node(s) where it was <b>not</b> clustered from (even if it was not even discovered on the node in the first place).
