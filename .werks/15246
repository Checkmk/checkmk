If a cluster is excluded from the active monitoring, stale services would appear on its nodes under certain conditions.

A cluster (just as any other host) can be excluded from the active monitoring be either configuring a new rule <i>"Hosts to be monitored"</i>, or by making the shipped default rule match the host by setting its tag <i>"Criticality"</i> to <i>"Do not monitor this host"</i>.

If this is done in conjunction with the services being clustered using the ruleset <i>"Clustered services for overlapping clusters"</i>, the <i>Check_MK</i> service and some of the passive services would go stale.
This affected all services after the clustered services, sorted alphabetically according to their description.
