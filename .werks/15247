This werk only affects users that have cluster nodes with enforced services which are clustered <b>and could be discovered</b> on the node as well.

This werk changes the preference of services that are both enforced and discovered if they are clustered.

For non-clustered services, an enforced service will take precedence over a discovered service (if they share the description).
Prior to this werk, the order of preference was reversed if the service was clustered.
This is now fixed:
An enforced service will always take precedence over a discovered one in case both are present.

Note that the parameters of these two services might not be the same:
The enforced service will have parameters as specified in the corresponding rule.
The discovered services parameters are determined by the rules matching the host were it will be shown.

This change makes the parameters of the clustered enforced service more reliable in the sense that they no longer depend on whether a service by the same description is discovered on the nodes.
