This werk affects the monitoring of one or more PostgreSQL instances via the Postgres agent plugin for Linux. The changes to the process filtering introduced in werk #15085 could lead to an empty "postgres_instances" section if the instance name contained capital letters.
Now, a case-sensitive filter is applied first, allowing case-insensitive filtering only if no processes could be found.
In order to apply this change you will need to reinstall the agent plugin.
