A Failing disks would report a working file system (as the file system was
still readable) but still needs to be replaced.
The check was extended to also report disk health status which was
introduced with DSM 7.1.

Also split the summary, remove duplicated temperature text, and remove text
about temperature levels, as no temperature levels can be defined for this
service.
