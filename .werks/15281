Title: mssql_blocked_sessions: Levels now overwrite state

The inline-help of the parameter "Levels for wait" of the rule "MSSQL Blocked
Sessions" mentions:

"The thresholds for wait_duration_ms. Will overwrite the default state set above."

This was not right. If only the levels were set, the check would go to CRIT
regardless of the wait_duration_ms.

After setting "Levels for wait" all sessions that wait for a shorter duration
than the warning level of "Levels for wait" will not affect the check result.
The check result is then controlled by wait_duration_ms being greater than the
levels defined.

If "Levels for wait" is not set (the default), the behaviour is not altered.
