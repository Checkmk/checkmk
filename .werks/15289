<a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/15559">Werk 15559</a> removed the invocation
of <tt>tnsping</tt>.

<tt>tnsping</tt> was used to check if the tns-alias could be reached.
If it could not be reached via <tt>tnsping</tt>, the connection to the database
is created using hostname and port from the configuration.

With <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/15559">Werk 15559</a> the invocation of
tnsping was completely removed and tns-alias was always used. This
lead to problems with different configurations of <tt>mk_oracle</tt>.

This change introduces a check if the <tt>tnsping</tt> binary is available.
When the binary is available, the logic of <tt>mk_oracle</tt> is not modified.
When the binary is not available, it is assumed that the tns-alias can be
reached.
