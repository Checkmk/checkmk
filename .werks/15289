<a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/15559">Werk 15559</a> removed the invocation
of <tt>tnsping</tt>.

<tt>tnsping</tt> was used to check if the tns-alias could be reached. If it
could not be reached via <tt>tnsping</tt>, hostname and port is used to connect
to the database.

With <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/15559">Werk 15559</a> the invocation of
<tt>tnsping</tt> was completely removed. tns-alias was always used. This lead
to problems with different configurations of <tt>mk_oracle</tt>.

This change introduces a check if the <tt>tnsping</tt> binary is available.
If the binary is available, the logic of <tt>mk_oracle</tt> before Werk 15559
is restored. If the binary is not available, it is assumed that the tns-alias
can be reached.
