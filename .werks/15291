The aws monitoring of checkmk differentiates between global and local services.
For global services, and  for getting an access token via sts service, checkmk
assumed that the global region "us-east-1" can be used.

This assumption is wrong. When hosting aws services in the following regions,
you have to use said regions to access the global services:

<ul>
<li>us-gov-east-1</li>
<li>us-gov-west-1</li>
<li>cn-north-1</li>
<li>cn-northwest-1</li>
</ul>

The error message visible in the debug output of the aws special agent was:

C+:
An error occurred (InvalidClientTokenId) when calling the GetCallerIdentity operation: The security token included in the request is invalid.
C-:

The global service region can now be configured.
