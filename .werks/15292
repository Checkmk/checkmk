Checkmk has a built in changelog viewer that shows Changelog items called
"Werks". For previous versions of checkmk it showed "Werks" for all versions of
Checkmk.

It turned out that the changelog was not complete: For previous major versions
of Checkmk not all Werks were displayed. As there is little benefit to display
Werks of previous major versions of checkmk we decided to remove those.

The whole list of all Werks is available on our homepage:
https://checkmk.com/werks

When updating to a new major version, the update process will check if there
are unacknowledged werks and tell the user about this, as this list will no
longer be available after the update.

This check is omitted for remote sites in a distributed configuration
environment, as long as both the remote site and the central site are running
at least version 2.3.0 of Checkmk.
