Title: align quoting of synchronous and asynchronous MRPE
Class: fix
Compatible: incomp
Component: checks

You are affected by this change if you use asynchronous MRPE and used double
quotes (<tt>"</tt>) in the MRPE command.

Quoting of mrpe commands differed between cached and non cached mrpe checks.

With this Werk the quoting rules for the normal/synchronous execution of MRPE
are applied to asynchronous MRPE commands.

The following can now be applied to both asynchronous and normal/synchronous
execution of MRPE commands: Use single quotes on the first level of quoting.

This command will correctly show <tt>output with spaces</tt> in the Service
output:

<tt>bash -c 'echo "output with spaces"'</tt>

If you execute asynchronous MRPE and the command uses double quotes on the
first level of quoting, adapt it accordingly.
