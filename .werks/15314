In certain circumstances it was possible that the `mssql.vbs` agent plugin
returned `no backup found` because it could not map the found backup to the
database.

The reason for that was, that the comparison between the backups database name
and the database name was case sensitive, but its possible to configure mssql
in a way that backups database name and database name does not match case
sensitive.

We now compare both names on the mssql server so the configured case
sensitivity is respected.
