Rule "Status of the Checkmk service" provides a setting called "State if
specific check plugins receive no monitoring data" where you can specify a
regular expression to match specific check plugins, and assign a status for
the "Check_MK" service if this check plugins receives no data.

The feature did work correctly if you specified a Status worse than "WARN".

But the "Check_MK" service went to "WARN" even if there was an rule to set the
status to "OK" if the specific section did not receive any data. This is fixed now.
