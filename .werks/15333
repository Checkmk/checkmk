On some windows system <code>Win32_ComputerSystemProduct</code> seems to return no data.
This call was introduced with <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/15332">Werk #15332</a>

Now the parser of this data (<code>win_computersystemproduct</code>) can handle empty data.

This change also reduces the data transported with the
<code>win_computersystemproduct</code> section, as we only use the UUID.
