On some windows system `Win32_ComputerSystemProduct` seems to return no data.
This call was introduced with [Werk #15332](https://checkmk.com/werk/15332)

Now the parser of this data (`win_computersystemproduct`) can handle empty data.

This change also reduces the data transported with the
`win_computersystemproduct` section, as we only use the UUID.
