<a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/16174">Werk #16174</a> introduced a regression: If the
checkmk agent plugin is running with pymongo version 3 the replication lag time
stamp is interpreted as seconds, but its actually milliseconds. This results in
errors like <code>ValueError (year 56319 is out of range)</code>.

The check is now compatible with pymongo version 3 and 4.
