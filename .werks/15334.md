[Werk #16174](https://checkmk.com/werk/16174) introduced a regression: If the
checkmk agent plugin is running with pymongo version 3 the replication lag time
stamp is interpreted as seconds, but its actually milliseconds. This results in
errors like `ValueError (year 56319 is out of range)`.

The check is now compatible with pymongo version 3 and 4.
