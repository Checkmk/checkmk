With <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/16023">Werk #16023</a> we switched the library used
to connect to oracle databases from <code>cx_Oracle</code> to <code>oracledb</code>. For <code>cx_Oracle</code>
it was mandatory to install "Oracle Instant Client". The newer <code>oracledb</code> library has
two modes: A stand alone thin mode and a thick mode that needs the "Oracle
Instant Client".

In order to fully replace <code>cx_Oracle</code>, <code>oracledb</code> needs to be in thick mode.
This is something we have not considered for Werk #16023.

With this Werk we now try to switch into the thick mode, and if this does not
work, we use thin mode. If you execute <code>check_sql</code> with <code>-v</code> switch you will see
a message if <code>oracledb</code> could not switch into thick mode.

<code>oracledb</code> searches for the "Oracle Instant Client" in several standard location.
<code>check_sql</code> will find the installation if the files (among other things <code>&ast;.so</code>
and <code>*.jar</code>) from the "Oracle Instant Client" files are directly in
<code>~local/lib/</code> in your site.
