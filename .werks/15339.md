With [Werk #16023](https://checkmk.com/werk/16023) we switched the library used
to connect to oracle databases from `cx_Oracle` to `oracledb`. For `cx_Oracle`
it was mandatory to install "Oracle Instant Client". The newer `oracledb` library has
two modes: A stand alone thin mode and a thick mode that needs the "Oracle
Instant Client".

In order to fully replace `cx_Oracle`, `oracledb` needs to be in thick mode.
This is something we have not considered for Werk #16023.

With this Werk we now try to switch into the thick mode, and if this does not
work, we use thin mode. If you execute `check_sql` with `-v` switch you will see
a message if `oracledb` could not switch into thick mode.

`oracledb` searches for the "Oracle Instant Client" in several standard location.
`check_sql` will find the installation if the files (among other things `*.so`
and `*.jar`) from the "Oracle Instant Client" files are directly in
`~local/lib/` in your site.
