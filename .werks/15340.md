You may be affected by this change if you monitor MySQL servers and you do not
have an `mysql_slave` service to monitor the "Slave Sync Status".

`mysql_slave` ignored the result and did not discover a service if the section
contained an error.

Now, in case the item section consists of a single line that looks like a MySQL
error message, the error message is propagated to the check result with an
`CRIT` status.

If you rediscover services on your MySQL hosts and see a critical `mysql_slave`
service, then this service probably always returned this error, but is was not
shown in your monitoring system in the past.

Please consult the error message and decide if you want to fix the Problem
described in the error message. If you don't want to monitor you the "Slave Sync
Status" of your MySQL database you may also disable the service discovery for
this item.
