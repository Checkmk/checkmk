In the past it was possible to see <code>PL/SQL: numeric or value error: character
string buffer too small</code> if a PDB name was longer than 11 characters. No memory
performance was available in this case.

This limit was now lifted, it's now possible to use the full length of 128
characters for PDB names. This is the limit for PDB names defined by oracle.
