The not configured agent executed the iostat part of the performance section, but
once configured via bakery it was not possible to select this section.

Now it is possible to select it. The option is called "Performance: IO stats"

Please be aware that not many users will benefit from this but have more
load on the system, only. For that reason the option is deactivated by default
in bakery.
