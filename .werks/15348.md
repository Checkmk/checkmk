This is a followup to [Werk #15284](https://checkmk.com/werk/15284) which added
a timeout to the `statgrab` command.

In certain cases it's possible that the `statgrab` command times out in the middle
of outputting data. This can lead to the problem, that some output is missing
for a certain disk. For example `disk_name` is shown, but `write_bytes` is
missing, which leads to a crash in the check plugin.

With this Werk, the whole `statgrab` output will be rejected in case of a
timeout, as we can not know if the output of `statgrab` is complete.
