You are affected by this werk if you have configured multiple `agent_azure`
special agents.

The `agent_azure` special agent caches some of the metrics it receives from
azure cloud. Before this change, all `agent_azure` configurations on a Checkmk
instance shared the same cache pool, so it could happen that different
configurations accessed the same cached elements and thus some metrics were not
available.
