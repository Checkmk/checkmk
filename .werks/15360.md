Previously it was possible to encounter an error like:

```
File "/omd/sites/presalesraw/lib/python3/cmk/checkengine/sectionparser.py", line 121, in _parse_raw_data
  return parse_function(list(raw_data))
File "/omd/sites/presalesraw/lib/python3/cmk/plugins/gcp/agent_based/gcp_status.py", line 72, in parse
  item = "Global" if location.id_ == "global" else constants.RegionMap[location.id_]
KeyError ('us')
 ```

We added the four Multi-Regions `asia`, `us`, `eu` and `europe` to the region
map for the gcp status check.

Please make sure to select the newly added Multi-Region entries in the special
agent configuration "Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Status" if you are interested
in the status of these Multi-Regions.
