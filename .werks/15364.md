When selecting labels in the new notification quick setup it was possible to
select labels although an already selected label had the same prefix.

But it does not make sense to select label `color:red` if `color:green` is
already among the selected labels.

Now Labels with the same key as already selected labels are no longer suggested
and can not be added.
