When using special characters in passwords stored in the password store for an
active check that is implemented in c (for example the legacy active check
<code>check_http</code>) the following error message was shown:

C+:
Invalid --pwstore= option: Password is too long for argument.
C-:

This was due to the c implementation calculated the length of the password in
UTF-8 encoded bytes, but the python implementation counted UTF characters.
