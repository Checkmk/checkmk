When using special characters in passwords stored in the password store for an
active check that is implemented in c (for example the legacy active check
`check_http`) the following error message was shown:

```
Invalid --pwstore= option: Password is too long for argument.
```

This was due to the c implementation calculated the length of the password in
UTF-8 encoded bytes, but the python implementation counted UTF characters.
