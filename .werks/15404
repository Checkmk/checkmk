The <tt>mk_inventory</tt> agent plugin outputs inventory data every four hours (by
default). This output is marked as <tt>persisted</tt> and stored on a Checkmk site
for longer use.

If the persisted option is missing, especially for only-inventory data, then
there might be a flapping effect of the HW/SW Inventory service and superfluous
history entries are added.
