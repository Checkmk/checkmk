When renaming hosts which were registered for TLS-encrypted agent communication, Checkmk ran into
the following error:
C+:
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'tuple' and 'str'
C-:

Furthermore, in distributed setups, renaming TLS-registered hosts which were monitored on remote
sites lead to a loss of registration, which prevented any further agent communication until the
affected hosts were re-registered.
