Depending on the underlying check plugin, Checkmk rendered temperature units with or without a space
in service outputs. As of this werk, Checkmk consistently renders temperatures with a space between
the numerical value and the unit. Examples:

LI: "12.0 °C" instead of "12.0°C"
LI: "256.41 K" instead of "256.41K"
