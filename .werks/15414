Under certain conditions, Checkmk forwarded logwatch messages multiple times to the Event Console.
Specifically, this happened if all of the following conditions were met:

LI: The forwarding was configured to create a single service (in contrast to one service per log file).
LI: This single service was clustered across multiple nodes.
LI: The same log file (wrt. the full path) was present on more than one node.
