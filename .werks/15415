This issue only affected network interface services. After discovering new services or after an
update, the user interface initially displayed `Exception: list index out of range` in the place
where the perfometer is supposed to be displayed. The log file <i>var/log/web.log</i> also recorded
these errors:

C+:
2023-04-11 10:00:28,884 [40] [cmk.web 78582] error rendering performeter
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
IndexError: list index out of range
C-:

These errors quickly disappeared after a couple of check cycles. As of this werk, these error
messages are not displayed anymore. Instead, the perfometer is rendered as soon as all necessary
metrics are found.
