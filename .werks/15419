This Werk addresses a regression that appeared with Werk #14871, which introduced stricter access rights for the Windows agent's ProgramData directory.

Windows agent plugins and local checks can be configured to run under a specific user or group, either by configuring the agent ruleset
<i>Run plugins and local checks using non-system account</i> or by editing the <tt>check_mk.user.yaml</tt> file appropriately.

Starting with Checkmk 2.1.0p15/the abovementioned Werk, plugins and local checks that are configured to run under a specific user failed to execute.<br>
The reason for this behavior was that, due to a preexisting bug, the Windows agent service then failed to set the proper access rights on the underlying files.<br>
With the stricter default access rights, the files were not accessible any longer.

This only affected plugins/local checks that are configured with the option <i>Run as User</i>, while the ones configured with <i>Run as local group</i> did succeed.

The abovementioned bug is now fixed, and plugins/local checks will resume to work as configured.

To apply this fix, you need to update/reinstall the Windows Agent once.
