When monitoring MSSQL databases with the mssql agent plugin, the discovery previously crashed when the plugin was unable to query for availability groups.

Now, unsuccessful queries for availability groups will be skipped on service discovery.
For already discovered services, an unsuccessful query will result in an UNKNOWN state, containing the error message passed by the mssql agent plugin.
