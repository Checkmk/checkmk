Title: Improve agent updater logging

Previously, the agent updater reported many errors coming from the agent bakery with this unhelpful log output:
C+:
Unexpected answer from Checkmk server: Missing json data.
Maybe we are talking to an agent bakery from before Checkmk 2.0?
C-:
This happened for all errors that can not be interpreted by the agent bakery in a meaningful way.

Starting with this Werk, the agent updater will instead propagate the unknown error, e.g.:
C+:
Agent Bakery: Unhandled exception: KeyError: 'Signatures'
See ~/var/log/web.log on site 'mysite' for details.
C-:

As a last resort, if the agent updater still receives a response that it can't parse, it will still log
<tt>Unexpected answer from Checkmk server: Missing json data.</tt>,
but this time without the note about an old agent bakery, as this was not helpful at all.

<i>Bonus</i>:<br>
The error from the above example is now handled correctly:
C+:
Agent Bakery: Missing signatures in status response from central bakery. Maybe agents are unsigned?
C-:
