This change will be compatible for most, if not all, users.<br>
You are only affected if you actually make use of the (now removed) group-writable flag on agent package folders.<br>
Normally, (especially when using the agent updater) the checkmk agent package files/folders will be installed with root ownership, while metadata of pre-existing folders won't be altered by the installation.<br>
Hence, only customized installation methods (e.g., unpacking the tar package with a special user) may possibly run into problems with this change.

Previously, the folders of a baked UNIX agent package were packaged with octal permissions of <tt>775</tt>.<br>
This lead to problems in some rare cases, e.g. when storing (and using) an ssh-id under an agent folder.

This has now been changed to <tt>755</tt>, as the agent's folders are owned by root and also installed under folders owned by root by default.<br>

Please note that these are the permissions of the folders as they are packaged by the agent bakery.<br>
Depending on the package manager (or <tt>tar</tt> unpack command) and the target system's umask, the installed folders may end up with other permissions.
