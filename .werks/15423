Title: Linux agent: Handle failing symmetric encryption
Class: security
Compatible: compat
Component: checks
Date: 1680268759

Knowledge: doc
Level: 1
State: unknown
Version: 2.0.0p35

Prior to this Werk the symmetric encryption of agent data (if configured) would fail silently if the option "Run agent as non-root user (Linux)" was also set, since these two options are not compatible.
As a result, agent output would be sent unencrypted.

If symmetric encryption is configured, but failing, the agent will now abort immediately and transmit a message about the failure as the only output.<br>
This will then be reported at the <i>Check_MK Agent</i> service of the host, alongside a <tt>CRIT</tt> status.
