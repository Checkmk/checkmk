This werk is to fix an issue when requesting an agent that doesn't
exist via the following endpoints

GET /objects/agent/non-existing-hash
GET /domain-types/agent/actions/download_by_hash/invoke

Previously, both of these endpoints would respond with a 500
internal server error, but now we conform to our other endpoints
and we return a problem response with an appropriate message.
