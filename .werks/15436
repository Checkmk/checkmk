This werk fixes an issue when deleting an aux tag that has a tag
group dependency.  Previously, you could do this via the rest-api
but now it is not allowed. The response now includes a 409 status
code plus an appropriate message informing the client of the
problem. Client side scripts should be adjusted accordingly.
