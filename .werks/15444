The check rule "Memory Usage of Clusters" adds a Memory service to the selected
hosts as an enforced service. In case this rule was configured with the
esx_vsphere_hostsystem_mem_usage_cluster checktype, and there were no limits
configured, the service would show an UNKNOWN state and a summary reading "Item
not found in monitoring data". This has been fixed.
