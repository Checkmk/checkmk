When a user attribute was *not* mapped via SAML, the default user profile,
which is configured in the global settings (Global settings -> User management
-> Default user profile), would overwrite any manual configuration done for
this user. This has been fixed. User profiles are now created/updated with the
following priority:

1. SAML attributes (if configured)
2. Manually selected attributes
3. Defaults
