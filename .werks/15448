Checkmk required both the response and the assertion statement to be signed in
order to accept an authentication request response from the identity provider.
However, as per the SAML specifications, only the assertion statement signature
is required and the response signature is optional. For this reason,
authentication request responses that only have the assertion statement signed
are now accepted.
