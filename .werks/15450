The mk-job agent plugin saves information about a job's running and completed
states in files under $MK_VARDIR/job. These files were written dynamically and
this could give rise to situations in which the state file was read while
information was being written to it. The information within the `<<<job>>>`
section could therefore be confusing and incomplete. This has been improved by
introducing atomic operations: files are now either present and complete, or
absent altogether.
