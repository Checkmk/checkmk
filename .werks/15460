Previously, the Azure agent would show an error when collecting metrics for
the Express Route vNet Gateway:
C+:
cmk.special_agents.agent_azure.ApiError: Failed to find metric configuration for provider: Microsoft.Network,
resource Type: virtualNetworkGateways, metric: P2SConnectionCount, Valid metrics: ExpressRouteGatewayPacketsPerSecond,
ExpressRouteGatewayBitsPerSecond, ...
C-:

The VNet Gateway service wasn't affected by this. Now, the error gets handled by the Azure agent plugin.
