With the werk 14533 we started suppressing Graph client errors.

This was needed in the version 2.1 because Graph client errors couldn't
be avoided in case the app used to call the Azure API didn't have the
"Directory.Read.All" Graph permission.

These errors can now be avoided by un-selecting "Users in the Active Directory",
"AD Connect Sync" and "App Registrations" services in the agent configuration,
which makes error suppression no longer necessary.
