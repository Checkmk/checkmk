This werk is incompatible for users that use file grouping and single file aggregation
and have "%s" in the section name.

It's now possible to define a name containing "%s" in both section and group names when
using single file aggregation.

In that case, the services of files that don't belong to a group will be named
"<SECTION NAME> <FILE NAME>" and the services of grouped files
"<SECTION NAME> <GROUP NAME> <FILE NAME>".
