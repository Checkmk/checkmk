You can now migrate existing users to another user connector, e.g. users with
connector "htpasswd" to a SAML or LDAP connector.

The option "Migrate users" is available within "Setup" - "Users" in the page
menu "Users" for users with permission "Migrate users to another connection".
Please note: The option is disabled if there is only one active user connector
configured.

To migrate users, please select the desired users on the "Users" page and use
the page menu entry "Migrate users". On the next page you have to choose the
target user connector and optionally, user attributes to unset on migration.
With "Migrate selected users" you will be aksed if you want to start the
migration. If you choose "Migrate" you will see a summary of migrated users and
possible problems that occurred during the migration.
