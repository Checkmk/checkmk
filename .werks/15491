If you edited pagetypes like topics, custom graphs, etc. and tried to save an
unallowed value, e.g. float instead of integer for "Sort order", the error
"UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'new_page_dict' where it is
not associated with a value" occurred.

You will now get a message which value is wrong to correct it before saving the
pagetype.
