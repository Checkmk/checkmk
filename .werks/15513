Title: jolokia_generic: Fix missing MBean in service description

Due to an unfavourable combination of previous werks, the string "MBean"
has been completely removed instead of removing duplicated occurances. This
is now fixed and the string will be again between the instance and the mbean
itself. With this werk #6629 is fully restored.

You need to rediscover your services if you have no "MBean" string in your
service descriptions at the moment for services generated by this check plugin.
