The active check for monitoring certificates produces two metrics by now.
These metrics have been written in a broken format and therefore never
been created. This is now fixed and both metrics are now available.

The affected metrics are
* certificate_remaining_validity (is also used for Perf-O-Meter)
* overall_execution_time
