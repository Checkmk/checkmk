This werk adds symmetric agent encryption on Solaris hosts. The
functionality is identical to the symmetric encryption for Linux hosts. 

To use the current and save encryption scheme, OpenSSL >= 1.0.0, better
OpenSSL >= 1.1.1, must be available on the host. 

Older encryption schemes can still be decrypted by the Checkmk site as for
Linux.
