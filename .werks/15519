During code maintenance the original title of the rule set "File grouping
patterns" has accidentally been changed to "Group patterns". As the rul
set matching has been changed, a second title needed to be added. This
title accidentally has been used as rule set title instead of the
configuration block title. This is now fixed and the original title "File
grouping patterns" is used again.
