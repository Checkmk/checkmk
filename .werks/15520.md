The following new options are now available:

- Connect to an explicit server instead of resolving the host name
  provided in the url. By default the host name provided in the URL will
  be used to establish the connection to a web server. It's now possible
  to connect optionally to an explicit (physical) server to check for the
  provided URL.
- Ignore certificates. In some scenarios a user needs to connect to a web
  endpoint that provides a certificate not matching the host of the URL,
  is self-signed or has a non-trusted root certificate in it's chain.
  Altough we recommend to solve these problems by solving the underlying
  problems, we acknowledge that a user may want to have individual
  services for both: web endpoint and it's certificate.
- Enforce IPv4 or IPv6 as protocol to use for the check. This option has
  been available on command line and is now also available in the rule set
  of the Checkmk UI.
