The following new options are now available:

- Connect to an explicit server instead of resolving the virtual host. In
  the old plug-in a user needed to specify an explicit host and could
  optionally set the virtual host. As most web endpoints will be a virtual
  host nowadays, the new plug-in takes the virtual server by default and
  connects optionally to an explicit (physical) server to check for that
  virtual host and it's web endpoint.
- Ignore certificates. In some scenarios a user needs to connect to a web
  endpoint that provides a certificate not matching to the virtual host,
  is self-signed or has a non-trusted root certificate in it's chain.
  Altough we recommend to solve these problems by solving the underlying
  problems, we acknowledge that a user may want to have individual
  services for both: web endpoint and it's certificate.
- Enforce IPv4 or IPv6 as protocol to use for the check. This option has
  been available on command line and is now also available in the rule set
  of the Checkmk UI.
