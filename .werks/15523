This fixes some display glitches for a very specific setup:
Users can configure the plugin "<i>State and Count of Processes</i>" to produce an HTML table in the service details, and additionally configure Checkmk to <i>not</i> escape it (such that it will actually be rendered as a table).

For these setups we now escape the values inside the table cells, in particular (but not exclusively) to fix rendering of strings containing a literal <tt>\n</tt>, such as <tt>F:\nginx</tt>.

While this makes these scenarios a little safer along the way, in general plugin output must not be trusted.
This is why we normally escape all plugin output, and discourage these configurations.
