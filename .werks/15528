The WATO ruleset of the logwatch EC forwarding performed a too strict validation.
This led to errors during update config and the service discovery, if corresponding services where discovered.
Update config would report

<tt>Transform failed: host='myHost', plugin='logwatch_ec', ruleset='logwatch_ec', params={'expected_logfiles': [...']}, error=MKUserError(None, 'Found no matching alternative.')</tt>

while the parameters column of the disocvery page reports "<i>Invalid check parameter</i>".

With this werk those messages disappear - until then they can safely be ignored.
