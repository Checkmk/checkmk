The only way of updating the discovered host labels of a cluster was to do it via the WATO service discovery page.
Doing this, on the other hand, would not update the host labels of the affected nodes accordingly.

Now a discovery via WATO, automation, REST API or commandline will always keep the discovered labels of nodes and their clusters synchronized.
