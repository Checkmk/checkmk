When configured to discover one service per sensor in the rule set <i>IPMI sensor discovery</i>, the IPMI check plugins now ignore absent sensors.

A sensor is considered absent if its status description contains any of the strings "<i>Device Removed</i>" "<i>Device Absent</i>" or "<i>Entity Absent</i>".
