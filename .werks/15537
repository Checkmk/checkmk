This changes the default setting for <i>"Sensor State"</i> of <i>"IPMI Sensors via Freeipmi or IPMItool"</i> from disabled to enabled.
The special agent for IPMI sensors using FreeIPMI has been able to report the states determined by FreeIPMI for long time, but it was disabled by default.
Since FreeIPMI state is used to determine the sensor state since <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/15536">Werk #15536</a>, it makes sense to enable it by default.
