This fixes a regression in Checkmk 2.1.0p27.

Affected are all distributed setups with remote sites running Checkmk version 2.1.0p27 and a central site older than that.
In these setups the service discovery page was broken for all hosts on those remote sites.

The displayed error message was "<i>() takes 8 positional arguments but 9 where given</i>".

The bulk discovery is not affected.

Affected users can either upgrade their entire distributed environment to 2.1.0p27, or upgrade the remote sites from p27 to p28.
