When the hosts' time is running ahead of the servers time the
time since last backup can be negative.

In this case the MSSQL backup check plugin would crash showing
the error message:

<b>ValueError (Cannot render negative timespan)</b>

Now the check plugin creates a warning result rather than crashing.
