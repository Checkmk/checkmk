The mk_sap agent plugin can now be used with Python 3.

 Previous to this werk, mk_sap could only be used with Python 2, as it was
 dependent on the sapnwrfc library which is not compatible with python3.

 This werk ports mk_sap to use pyrfc which is only compatible with Python 3

The old mk_sap plugin can still be used with Python 2 and is now called mk_sap_2

If the host this agent plugin is executed on has Python 3 installed:
<ul>
<li>install pyrfc on this host (for more details have a look at the mk_sap.py agent plugin source code)</li>
<li>redeploy agent via bakery or manually</li>
</ul>

If the host this agent plugin is executed on has only Python 2 installed nothing changes. The Python 2 agent plugin
will automatically be used in this case.
