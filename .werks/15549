When using a pre-1.6 MSSQL agent plugin the {{mssql_blocked_sessions}}
check plugins would crash during discovery.

The pre-1.6 MSSQL agent plugins are now deprecated and can no longer be used.
Old still existing services will go to {{UNKNOWN}} and encourage you to update to a newer agent plugin version.
After a rediscovery the old services will vanish and new services will not be discovered.

Therefore an upgrade as described in <a href="https://checkmk.com/de/werk/6140">Werk #6140</a> is necessary.
