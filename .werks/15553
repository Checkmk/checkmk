Prior to this werk, the REST API was quite lenient when it came
to specifying a time allowing the format hh:mm for some while asking
the hh:mm:ss format for others. This werk targets the active_time_ranges
field where now a hh:mm:ss format is enforced.

Due to the introduction of the more strict pattern, user scripts must be
adjusted accordingly to respect the new format.
