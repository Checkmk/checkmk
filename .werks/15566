mk_oracle.ps1 provides a configuration to exclude sections for <tt>SID</tt>.
This was only working if you prepend the section name with <tt>sql_</tt>, like e.g.:
C+:
$EXCLUDE_XE="sql_performance"
C-:

If you were using the agent bakery to generate the configuration, the exclude mechansim was not working as it didn't generate the prefix.
It is now not necessary anymore to add this prefix (however with prefix it is stil, like e.g.l working).
In order to apply this fix, the agent plugin <tt>mk_oracle.ps1</tt> must be re-deployed onto your monitored host.
