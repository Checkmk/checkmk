This werk is relevant for you if you're monitoring your proxmox backups and you noted some of them are missing.
The reason for that is they were transferred in less than a second.
A potential traceback could have been:
C+:
cmk.special_agents.agent_proxmox_ve.BackupTask.LogParseWarning: End of VM '123' while still information is missing (we have: {'archive_name', 'archive_size', 'started_time', 'total_duration'})
C-:
This pattern was not yet recognized by our special agent and will now be honored.
