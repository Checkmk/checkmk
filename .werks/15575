This werk affects you, in case you've been using the ruleset systemd_services in combination with an enforced service (aka static check).
You may encounter the following error during updating to 2.2:
C+:
-| WARNING: Invalid rule configuration detected
-| Ruleset: static_checks:systemd_services
-| Title: Deprecated: Systemd single services
-| Folder: foo/bar
-| Rule nr: 1
-| Exception: You cannot save this rule. There are no elements defined for this selection yet.
C-:

This is fixed now and the update process should work without issues.
