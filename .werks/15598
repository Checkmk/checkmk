Title: group_config: deleting a non-existing group no longer has a 400 response

This werk introduces a fix to the contact_group, host_group and service_group
endpoints. Previously when deleting an object or bulk deleting a list of
objects, the rest-api would respond with a 400 status code when the group
didn't exist. We now respond with a 404 Not Found.
