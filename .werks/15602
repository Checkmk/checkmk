Previously, if the wrapper program <tt>mk-job</tt> was interrupted by a reboot, the <tt>Job</tt>
service would continue to show the job, which was started by <tt>mk-job</tt>. This job was shown to
be running despite it being terminated by the reboot. This can be fixed by removing the
corresponding file created by <tt>mk-job</tt>. With this werk, <tt>mk-job</tt> cleans up the file
after being interrupted. Thus, these terminated jobs will no longer be shown as running.
