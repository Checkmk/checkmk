Previously, the agent plugin <tt>mk_filestats.py</tt> would show an error such as
C+:
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xc4 in position 42: invalid continuation byte
C-:
if it encountered any file, whose file path cannot be encoded to UTF-8.
With this werk, the plugin no longer crashes.
Any non-UTF-8 sequence of bytes is replaced with U+FFFD.
In particular, this affects the filters and grouping.
