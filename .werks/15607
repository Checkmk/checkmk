The Check_MK service often showed the message
C+:
[piggyback] Missing data WARN
C-:
before a piggyback host was deleted.  This lead to many false alarms in dynamic environments such as
Kubernetes.  The root cause of this was that the <tt>delete-hosts</tt> automation would delete
piggyback files, which where still in use.  With this Werk, the piggyback files are cleaned up by
Check_MK's dedicated housekeeping job (see Werk 5538).
