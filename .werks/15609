This change affects those using the <tt>Kubernetes</tt> together with the feature <tt>Collect
information about Persistent Volume Claims & Persistent Volumes</tt> (available in 2.2.0 and above).

With this feature turned on, the Kubernetes agent will contact the kubelet on each node via a proxy
provided by the Kubernetes API server. This means the data collection depends on the number of
nodes and the latency of the Pod network. If this data collection takes too long, the Kubernetes
agent may timeout. This in turn causes the previously collected API data to be discarded.

With this Werk, the data collection time is limited to 30 seconds. The omission of the data causes
the omission of metrics from the <tt>PVC</tt> service of a Pod. This is consistent with how missing
data is handled, if the corresponding kubelet is down.
