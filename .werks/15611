Users which execute <tt>omd mv</tt> or <tt>omd cp</tt> expect Checkmk to not only rename the site,
but also migrate the existing configurations created by the <tt>Dynamic host management</tt>.

Previously, if a host was created by the DCD, then the host property <tt>Creation / Locking > Locked
by</tt> would not be migrated.  Instead the site would show <tt>Unknown site (OLD_SITE_ID)</tt> and
the host would no longer be updated by the DCD. With this Werk, the migration is done automatically
during the renaming.
