This Werk affects users who use the check plugin <tt>omd_diskusage</tt> (a 2.2.0 feature).

Previously, <tt>check_mk_agent.linux</tt> would report misleading information, if it had
insufficient permissions to read the directories from <tt>/omd/sites/</tt>. With this change, these
directories are skipped.
