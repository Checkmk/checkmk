With this Werk, it is no longer possible to specify ports outside of the range 1 to 65535.
This affects rules such as <tt>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</tt>. In case you have an invalid port,
the following error will be shown while updating.
C+:
-| WARNING: Invalid rule configuration detected
-| Ruleset: special_agents:aws
-| Title: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
-| Folder: main
-| Rule nr: 1
-| Exception: -1 is too low. The minimum allowed value is 1.
