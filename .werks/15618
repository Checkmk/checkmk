This Werk is relevant to users, whom create a new <tt>Kubernetes</tt> rule.

With this change, one trailing slash will be removed from endpoints. This affects both API server
connection and the data collection from the collectors. Specifically, previously specifying the URL

C+:
https://<control plane ip>:443/
C-:

results in an API call to

C+:
https://<control plane ip>:443//version
C-:

But now it results in a call to

C+:
https://<control plane ip>:443/version
C-:

With the new change, specifying

C+:
https://<control plane ip>:443//
C-:

will results in the behaviour of calling

C+:
https://<control plane ip>:443//version
C-:

Old configurations are migrated to match the new calling convention. Thus, existing rules are
unaffected. Note, this Werk does not implement RFC 3986 URL joining.
