The option <tt>Enforce IPv4</tt> of the rule <tt>Check HTTP service</tt> did not enforce IPv4.
With this Werk, <tt>Enforce IPv4</tt> adds the option '-4' to the service check command.
Existing rules are migrated to the new option <tt>Use any network address</tt>.
Thus, their behaviour does not change.
