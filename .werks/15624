Previously, if the user entered an invalid option into a configuration file for
<tt>mk_logwatch.py</tt>, the plugin would crash with the traceback:

C+:
ValueError: Invalid overflow: 'c' (choose from dict_keys(['C', 'W', 'I', 'O']))
C-:

or similar. This would cause the output to be assigned to the wrong service, since no section
header was produced. With this Werk, the traceback will only be shown, if the option
<tt>--debug</tt> is used. This is analogous to what happens if the configuration file is missing.
