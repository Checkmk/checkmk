This change affects the <tt>Interface</tt> service on Windows nodes.

The plugin <tt>winperf_if</tt> would show the operation state 'Connected', even if no information
about the operation state was available. Note, the Windows Agent does not always provide the
operation state. This is the case when none of the plugins are enabled. The
check will now show 'Not available' instead.

If you see this state, we recommend that you enable the plugins to collect the necessary data. This
can be done via the <tt>Agent Bakery</tt> rule
<tt>Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX > Agent rules > Network interfaces on Windows > Add rule: Network interfaces on Windows</tt>.

After potentially adjusting the agent, users should do re-discovery of the interface services. This
ensures that the discovered operation state is consistent with the current behaviour.

If it impossible to use the agent plugin, existing rules <tt>Network interface and switch port discovery</tt>
and <tt>Network interfaces and switch ports</tt> should to be adjusted instead.
