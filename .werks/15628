Title: VMware ESXi [Filesystems]: Show Servers
Class: fix

Version: 2.3.0b1

The built-in view <tt>VMware ESXi [Filesystems]</tt> would previously only show
servers with the label <tt>cmk/os_family:VMware ESXi</tt>. This would cause it
to erroneously filter out hosts in specific agent configurations.
