In Werk 15621, the behaviour of <tt>Enforce IPv4</tt> was changed. Existing rules have been
migrated to a new option (with the old behaviour). However, the selection of the option <tt>Enforce
IPv4</tt> in the user interface did not work properly. It resulted in the following crash

C+:
ValueError('ipv4_enforced' is not a valid Family)
C-:

This Werk fixes the selection.
