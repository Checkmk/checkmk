Previously, the plugin <tt>cisco_fru_module_status</tt> would raise the error

C+:
ValueError ('14' is not a valid PhysicalClasses)
C-:

while parsing the section. With this Werk, the crash no longer occurs.
The state '14' is now remapped to 'unknown'. Note, that the MIB v2/ENTITY-MIB.my does not list the
state '14', so may we might have to update this mapping, if Cisco aligns their MIBs with the
behaviour of their devices.
