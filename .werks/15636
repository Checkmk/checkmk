would be shown, if the prediction made by the CMC was <tt>0</tt>. With this Werk, the predicted
value is now always shown. The prediction levels have been updated accordingly.
LI: <tt>Absolute difference from prediction:</tt> 0 is treated like any other value. Some alarms, which used to be omitted, are now correctly reported.
LI: <tt>In relation to standard deviation:</tt> 0 is treated like any other value. Some alarms, which used to be omitted, are now correctly reported.
LI: <tt>Relative difference from prediction:</tt> Non-zero values are treated in a different manner. No dynamic levels are computed. This means the behaviour of this parameter has not changed with this Werk.

Note, the configuration <tt>In relation to standard deviation</tt> can lead to false alarms, if the
standard deviation is zero.
