This change affects users of the option <tt>In relation to standard deviation</tt> from
<tt>Predictive Levels</tt>.

<tt>Predictive Levels</tt> are computed by considering every data point matching the configured
reference period. If the data never changes across these points in time, then the standard deviation
is zero. Thus, the predicted levels will precisely equal to the predicted value. Previously, this
would result in a CRIT. This happened no matter the levels set via <tt>In relation to standard
deviation</tt>.

While the described behaviour is self-consistent, most of these alarms are undesired and diminish
the usefulness of <tt>Predictive Levels</tt>.

With this Werk, no levels are applied, if the standard deviation is zero.
