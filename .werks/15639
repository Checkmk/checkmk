This change affects users of the option <tt>In relation to standard deviation</tt> from
<tt>Predictive Levels</tt>.

<tt>Predictive Levels</tt> are computed by considering every data point matching the configured
reference period. If there is only a single data point available, the standard deviation is
undefined. Previously, since the standard deviation was unavailable, Checkmk would use the absolute
value of the reference value. In particular, if the reference value was 0, then this would result in
a CRIT.

With this Werk, no levels are applied, if the standard deviation is undefined.
