As of version 2.1.0p30 and 2.2.0p4, it was no longer possible to use the plugin postgres_instances,
if the instance name was empty, i.e. ``. In previous versions, this plugin would show a service with
the item `PostgreSQL Instance `. This service would be OK, if there was at least one process
belonging to any postgres instance, and CRIT otherwise.

With this Werk, the plugin postgres_instances no longer crashes, if there is an empty instance name.
The old service `PostgreSQL Instance ` is no longer discovered. Instead the new check plugin
postgres_processes can be used.
