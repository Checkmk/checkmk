Previously, the `Scheduled Task State` could be N\A, if the Action of a Windows
task contained a comma. Moreover, the plugin only supported German or English
localization settings for Windows. Finally, with German localization settings
disabled scheduled tasks would be discovered (despite what the checkman page
claimed). This worked correctly with English localization settings. With this
Werk, `windows_tasks` uses the new PowerShell API to obtain the data. This
fixes the aforementioned issues.

Users, whom desire to discover disabled tasks need to configure the new service
discovery rule `Windows Tasks`.

The changes in this Werk are only applicable, if the underlying Windows version
supports the PowerShell API. The Windows versions supported by Checkmk 2.2.0 and
later all support the required the PowerShell functions. Versions such as
Windows 7 does not support the PowerShell API.
