Previously, the `Scheduled Task State` could be N\A, if the Action of a Windows
task contained a comma. Moreover, the plugin only supported German or English
localization settings for Windows. With this Werk, `windows_tasks` uses the
new PowerShell API to obtain the data. This fixes the aforementioned issues.

The changes in this Werk are only applicable, if the underlying Windows version
supports the PowerShell API. The Windows versions supported by Checkmk 2.2.0 and
later all have the required the PowerShell functionality. Windows 7 does not
meet the requirements.
