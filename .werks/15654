The Windows Tasks rule allowed the user to map 'not enabled' tasks to a specific state.
This rule also allowed to target tasks which switched from an 'enabled' to a 'disabled' state
between check cycles. However, tasks which were 'disabled' during discovery were previously
filtered out and could therefore not benefit from this rule.

This led to confusion as to what group was targeted by the specification 'not enabled'. This
werk, therefore, introduces an appropriate discovery rule which allows the user to control
whether 'disabled' tasks, at the point of discovery, are supposed to be monitored or not.
