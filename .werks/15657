This werk is only incompatible for users who process the json output of the agent controller status
command (<tt>cmk-agent-ctl status --json</tt>). For all other users, this werk is purely
informational.

The human-readable output of the status command has changed as follows:

LI: The section about the remote status of a connection does not report `Registration state: operational` anymore, since this was redundant information. If the host is registered, we now simply report hostname and connection mode.
LI: If the host is not registered anymore at the monitoring site, we now report `Not registered`. Before, the controller reported a 404 error with a description stating that the host is not registered.

These changes are also reflected in the new json schema for the remote status, which reads

C+:
{"status": "Registered", "hostname": "...", "connection_mode": "..."}
C-:

for registered hosts and

C+:
{"status":"NotRegistered"}
C-:

for hosts which are not registered.
