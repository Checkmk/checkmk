The temperature unit used to render graphs and perfometers is now configurable on a per-user basis
via the user profile. Users can either explicitly choose between degree Celsius and degree
Fahrenheit or they can use the default temperature unit, which in turn is configurable via a global
setting (linked in the user profile).

Note that this new setting does not affect the temperature unit used in service outputs (summary and
details). Use the ruleset <i>Temperature</i> to configure this.

Finally, with this new feature, the option to configure
<a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/14534">unit conversions in graphs tunings</a> is deprecated. This
option was specifically introduced to make the temperature unit in graphs user-configurable, which
is now possible via the setting introduced in this werk. Hence, unit conversions are no
longer configurable via graph tunings and any already exisiting settings will be ignored.
