When creating a new site or when changing the port configurations of an existing site via <tt>omd
config</tt>, Checkmk was supposed to check for duplicate port allocations (also across multiple
sites). This mechanism was broken, which means that ports could be allocated multiple times.
Specifically, the following port settings were affected:

LI: <tt>APACHE_TCP_PORT</tt>
LI: <tt>AGENT_RECEIVER_PORT</tt>
LI: <tt>LIVESTATUS_TCP_PORT</tt>

As of this werk, when attempting to configure an already allocated port, Checkmk will increment the
port number until a free port is found.
