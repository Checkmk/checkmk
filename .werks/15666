The mk-job agent plugin for Solaris would add 0 values as placeholders for
metrics that cannot be retrieved using the /usr/bin/time command. This is
misleading and incorrect. The affected metrics are: 'reads', 'writes',
'max_res_kbytes', 'navg_mem_kbytes', 'invol_context_switches', and
'vol_context_switches'. This has been fixed.

The mk-job.solaris plugin needs to be rolled out to the host in order to apply
this fix.
