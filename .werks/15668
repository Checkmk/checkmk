The check mssql_availability_groups would crash when a replica's sync state is
"PARTIALLY_HEALTHY". This would be shown in the "Check_MK Discovery" service of
the relevant host with the error message

"ValueError ('PARTIALLY_HEALTHY' is not a valid SyncState)".

This has been fixed and the Checkmk state of the corresponding service is WARN.
