Checkmk would sign its authentication requests with RSA-SHA512. However, some
identity providers (e.g. some versions of Microsoft ADFS) do not support any
signature algorithms beyond SHA256. As a result, the authentication requests
would be rejected with an error message similar to

"Error details: MSIS7093: The message is not signed with expected signature
algorithm. Message is signed with signature algorithm
http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha512. Expected signature algorithm
http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256."

For this reason, Checkmk now uses RSA-SHA256 to sign its authentication
requests.
