The logwatch pattern analyzer tests and shows the reclassification of states of
log messages which have been configured using the "Logfile patterns" rule. The
column titled "State" showed the Checkmk state of the corresponding service.
This could lead to some confusion when the log message had been reclassified to
"IGNORE". The "State" column has been renamed to "Checkmk state", and an
additional column "Logwatch state" has been added to remove any ambiguity.
