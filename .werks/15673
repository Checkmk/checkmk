The "Logfile pattern analyzer" shows the configured "Logifle patterns" rules,
but ordered them based on the rule number. This could make it difficult to spot
for which folder the corresponding rule had been configured.

The rules are now grouped and foldable by folder, similar to other rule
overviews.
