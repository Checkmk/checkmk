Previously when you provided a host that didn't exist
the response would be

C+:
{
  "title": "Bad Request",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "These fields have problems: host_name",
  "fields": {
    "host_name": [
      "Host 'example.com' exists, but is not monitored. Activate the configuration?"
    ]
  }
}
C-:

we now reply with

C+:
{
  "title": "Bad Request",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "These fields have problems: host_name",
  "fields": {
    "host_name": [
      "Host not found: 'example.com'"
    ]
  }
}
