With Werk #15069 escaping for the <tt>Insert HTML section between body and table</tt> section was introduced.
Unfortunately links were not allowed anymore.

This Werk removes the escaping for links.

Links (<tt>a</tt>) are now allowed with the attributes <tt>href</tt> and <tt>target</tt>.
The <tt>href</tt> needs to be either relative or when absolute must use one of the following URL schemas: <tt>http</tt>, <tt>https</tt>, <tt>mailto</tt>.
