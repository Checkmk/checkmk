Edition: cre
Knowledge: doc
Level: 1
Version: 2.3.0b1

Prior to this Werk it was possible to inject HTML or Javascript (Reflected XSS).
A legitimate user tricked to click on a prepared link would then run arbitrary Javascript code in a valid session.

This vulnerability is only triggerable if another <i>Business Intelligence</i> <i>BI pack</i> (next to the default) was created.

We found this vulnerability internally.

<b>Affected Versions</b>:
LI: 2.2.0
LI: 2.1.0
LI: 2.0.0
LI: 1.6.0 (probably older versions as well)

<b>Indicators of Compromise</b>:
To check for exploitation one can check the site apache access log <tt>var/log/apache/access_log</tt> for entries like <tt>/$SITENAME/check_mk/wato.py?mode=bi_aggregations&bulk_moveto=</tt>.
The order of the URL paramters can be changed by an attacker.
Potential injected code would be in the parameter <tt>bulk_moveto</tt>.

<b>Changes</b>:
This Werk introduces escaping for the vulnerable parameter.
