With Checkmk 2.2, announced by Werk #14977, the usage of mod_auth_mellon was deprecated. This release now removes mod_auth_mellon.

If you still have mod_auth_mellon in your apache config, the apache service will not be able to start.
Errors are logged to <tt>var/log/apache2/error_log</tt>.
If you want to continue to use SAML you can do it in the Enterprise Edition via <i>Setup -> Users -> SAML connections</i>.
