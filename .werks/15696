When setting the check interval of a Linux host to 5 minutes, you recently may have experienced sporadic connection resets.
This results in a critical <i>Check_MK</i> service, showing a summary containing
C+:
[agent] Communication failed: [Errno 111] Connection refused
C-:
or similar.

The reason for this was that the agent controller checks for an active connection registry every 5 minutes and by that closes the socket for an instant.<br>
Since this 5-minute timeout starts whenever a connection has been accepted successfully, there's a significant chance to exacly hit a request from a 5-minute check interval.

To fix this, the config reload is now done without closing the socket temporarily.<br>

To apply this fix, you have to update agents once on affected hosts.<br>
Since the agent communation only fails sporadically, this can be accomplished by an automatic agent update, if configured.
