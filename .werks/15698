This is a regression that came with Checkmk 2.1.0p26/Werk #15458.

When configuring the agent ruleset <i>Count, size and age of files - mk_filestat (Linux/Solaris)</i>
and selecting "Deploy the Filestats plugin without configuration", previously, the agent bakery did
crash with a message containing
C+:
cmk.utils.exceptions.MKGeneralException: Error running automation call bake-agents (exit code 2), error:
‘bool’ object is not iterable
C-:

As a consequence of the fix, the structure of the ruleset had to be adapted to actually support rule merging.<br>
See the inline help of the ruleset for more details.<br>
However, existing rules will be auto-migrated to the new structure.
