In previous versions, the smart_stats check may have reported wrong temperature
values for ATA disks.<br>
This lead to false-positive CRIT states in "SMART ... Stats" services.

Technical background:

The attribute names for ATA disks reported by smartutils turned out
to be either not clearly defined (multiple names for the same attribute),
or even plainly wrong.

To avoid missing some attributes or to even report wrong data,
we now look up the names of all actually used attributes by their
attribute ID.
