The ruleset "Check event state in Event Console" now has a new
configuration entry "Show last log message".<br>
With this entry, you can decide whether and where (summary or details)
the last relevant log entry will be displayed within the resulting service.
By default it will be shown in the service details.

Rules that have been created before this change will default to
"Show last log message in service summary", as this was old behavior.
