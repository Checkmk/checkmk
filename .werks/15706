When executing "omd update" with old sites that have been running with various older stable versions,
the permissions of some directories may not be as we expect. Instead of asking user for confirmation
we now enforce the new default permissions to be applied.

This change affects these directories:

<ul>
<li>etc/check_mk/multisite.d</li>
<li>etc/check_mk/conf.d</li>
<li>etc/check_mk/conf.d/wato</li>
<li>local/share/nagvis/htdocs/userfiles/images/maps</li>
<li>local/share/nagvis/htdocs/userfiles/images/shapes</li>
<li>etc/ssl/private</li>
<li>etc/ssl/certs</li>
</ul>
