The main menu of the UI has now more extended support for keyboard navigation.

You can open up the menus with the following key combinations:

* Monitoring: `ALT + m`
* Setup: `ALT + s`
* Customize: `ALT + c`

The search field is automatically focussed (as before), you can directly insert
your search term. By using `TAB` you can navigate the search results and confirm
your choice with `ENTER`.

Pressing `ESC` for the first time clears the current search term. A second `ESC`
closes the open menu.

Utilizing the workflow can make navigating to the desired pages in Checkmk much
faster.
