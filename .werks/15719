Title: mk_docker: Prevent "Missing monitoring data for plugins" warnings
Class: fix

In case a docker node section can not be computed by the mk_docker agent plugin, the "Docker node
info" service reports about the error in detail. Until this werk, the "Check_MK" service did also
raise an issue regarding the missing agent section, like: "Missing monitoring data for plugins:
docker_node_disk_usage". This duplicate information is now suppressed, reducing the number of
notification Checkmk produces in such situations.
