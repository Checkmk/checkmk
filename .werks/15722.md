Starting with 2.2.0 (see #15062), we use a umask of 0077 to prevent files and directories owned by
the site user from being world readable. However, when updating from the CRE to a non CRE edition,
some files and directories were still set to be world readable during 'omd update'. This is now in
line with the other files.
