In case a Docker host with installed Docker agent plugin (<tt>mk_docker</tt>) was monitored by
multiple Checkmk sites, the <i>Docker node info</i> service might have sporadically reported UNKN
with the following error message:

C+:
Plugin exception in section_node_disk_usage: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/var/lib/check_mk_agent/mk_docker_df.tmp....' -> '/var/lib/check_mk_agent/mk_docker_df.spool'
C-:

To benefit from this werk, users have to re-deploy the Docker agent plugin on affected hosts.
