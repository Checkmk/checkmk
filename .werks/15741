New Checkmk sites will be created with a twelve (12) character minimum length for users' passwords, this can be edited within the site <i>(Setup > General > Global settings > Edit global setting > Password policy for local accounts)</i>.
Existing sites will have their password policy updated to a twelve (12) character minimum length had password policy not been previously defined, if a password policy is already in use the existing configuration will not change.
The password policy minimum length can still be manually set to less then twelve (12) characters.
