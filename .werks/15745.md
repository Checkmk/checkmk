Prior to this werk, generating a support diagnostic for deployments with distributed monitoring of multiple Checkmk instances would expose site secrets within the "etc/check_mk/multisite.d/sites.mk" file.

All site secrets are now replaced with "redacted" during the generation process of support diagnostics <i>(Setup > Maintenance > Support diagnostics)</i> where <i>Checkmk Configuration files</i> have been selected with at least low sensitivity or the <i>sites.mk</i> file has been selected individually.
