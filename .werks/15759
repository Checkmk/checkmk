Werk 15848 (version 2.1.0p29) introduced a bug which caused the mk_oracle
plugin to execute incorrectly and stop sending data to Checkmk.

If called from the command line from the plugin's parent directory, the plugin
incorrectly reported `Unhandled location` and terminated, even if the location
of the plugin was correct.
