In case the state from the device wasn't OK, thresholds from the device were
appended to the service details, e.g. '46 °C, warning (device warn/crit at 56/56 °C)'.
This suggests that the temperature value exceeds the threshold, which isn't the case.

To make it clearer, the service details are changed to: '46 °C, State on device: warning'
in this case.
