Previously, the discovery service would crash in case of incorrect
lines in the local check section. This prevented all other local services
with correct format from being discovered.

Now, the discovery service no longer crashes, the faulty local service is
discovered and it crashes with a helpful message. All other local services
are discovered and their state isn't influenced by the incorrect service.
In case when the item can't be determined from the local section line, the
line is completely ignored.
