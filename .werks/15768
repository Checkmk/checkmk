Previously, siemens_plc_duration check would crash if duration was smaller
than a second with an error:
C+:
ValueError (invalid literal for int() with base 10: '0.05000000074505806')
C-:

Now, the check doesn't crash anymore and it's possible to input thresholds
smaller than a second in the "Siemens PLC Duration" monitoring rule.
