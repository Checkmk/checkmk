By default, Azure agent fetches usage details (costs)
on each run.

Now, an additional option 'Monitor usage details' has
been added to the 'Microsoft Azure' agent configuration.
If disabled the agent will no longer fetch usage details,
which can be useful if querying usage details fails periodically.
