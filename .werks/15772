Previously, piggyback sections had a cache validitiy of 90 seconds
if checking was called from Checkmk and (checking interval * 1.5)
seconds if called from the command line.
This led to services in piggyback hosts becoming stale if checking
interval of a source host was bigger than 1 minute.

Cache validity is now (checking interval * 1.5) in both cases.
