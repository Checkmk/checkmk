LDAP connection names have have stricter requirements in Checkmk version 2.2.0.
Up until now, Checkmk did not check these requirements when creating new LDAP
connections nor did an update convert them to fit the new requirements.

This Werk tightens LDAP connection id validation to fit the new requirements.
Updating Checkmk will cause all spaces in connection ids to be replaced with
underscores, as this is the most common manifestation of this incompetability.

If you still are unable to update, please check if your connection id consist only
of letters and dashes, starting with a letter.
