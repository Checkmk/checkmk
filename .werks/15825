The 'effective_attributes' field that can optionally be requested in the 'show host' and 'show all hosts'
endpoints now uses the same format as the 'attributes' field.
This Werk completes Werk 13978 and also fixes a bug that was introduced with it.
After Werk 13978, all attributes except for 'meta_data' were omitted from the output in 'effective_attributes'.
The is no longer the case.
