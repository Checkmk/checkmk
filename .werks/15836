In previous releases, an overly stringent memory limit for the fetcher 
process could result in frequent restarts and an excessive number of 
entries in the cmc.log file.

With this release, we have addressed the issue by adjusting the memory 
constraints. The fetcher process now has an increased memory limit, 
which should significantly reduce restarts and log verbosity, leading 
to improved stability and performance.
