Previously, users were required to install an additional plugin to 
determine the state of a network interface on Windows.

With the current release, this functionality is now integrated directly into the 
Windows agent, eliminating the need for extra plugins. 

For enhanced consistency across operating systems, network interfaces that are 
operational are now marked as `up`, and those that are not available are marked 
as `down`, aligning with the terminology used on Linux.

This change may lead to critical alerts with interfaces correctly reported as 
`down`, which have been in that state for a long time but were previously 
erroneously reported as  `Connected`.
