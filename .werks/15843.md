You might be affected by this Werk if you use <tt>mk_oracle</tt> on Windows.

Werk <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/16232">Werk #16232</a> introduced a 
regression, thereby disrupting Oracle monitoring on Windows.

This Werk addresses above mentioned issue that affects versions 2.1.0p41, 
2.2.0p24, and 2.3.0b4.

Since this release, Oracle monitoring on Windows is fully supported under 
condition you use an account without administrator rights or the certain 
executable binaries, <tt>sqlplus.exe</tt>, <tt>tnsping.exe</tt> and, if 
presented, <tt>crsctl.exe</tt> are write-protected, with the possible 
exception being the Administrator.

If you are unable or prefer not to use an unprivileged account then you may 
need to adjust permissions for above mentioned binaries: remove <tt>Write</tt>, 
<tt>Full Control</tt> and <tt>Modify</tt> permissions for any non-Administrator 
user and group.
