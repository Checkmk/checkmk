We've introduced a new `Microsoft SQL Server (Linux, Windows)` plug-in for MS SQL 
database monitoring, see 
[werk 15842: Enhanced MS SQL Server monitoring](https://checkmk.com/werk/15842). 
The new plugin extends the functionality of `Microsoft SQL Server (Windows)` 
by adding more options and features.

We recommend that you upgrade to the `Microsoft SQL Server (Linux, Windows)` plug-in to monitor MS SQL databases. This new agent plugin can be deployed 
alongside the Checkmk agent on your database systems, just like the previous 
plugin. You can also use this plugin on any Windows or Linux 
server to monitor remote MSSQL servers over the network.

The previous `Microsoft SQL Server (Windows)` rule set is deprecated and renamed to `Microsoft SQL Server (deprecated)`. Please note that you may need to adjust settings on your databases or continue running the old plug-in for the time being, as the agent plug-in cannot connect to local database instances that are not available over a TCP/IP connection.
