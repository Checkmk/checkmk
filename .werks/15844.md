We've introduced a new plugin `Check MS SQL Server (Linux, Windows)` for MS SQL 
database monitoring, see werk 15842 Enhanced MS SQL Server monitoring. The new  
plugin extends the functionality of the `Microsoft SQL Server (Windows)` adding 
more options and features.

We recommend upgrading to the `Check MS SQL Server (Linux, Windows)` plugin 
for monitoring MS SQL databases. This new agent plugin can be deployed 
alongside the Checkmk agent on your database systems, just like the previous 
plugin. Alternatively, you can deploy this plugin on any Windows or Linux 
server to monitor remote MSSQL servers over the network.

The previous rule `Microsoft SQL Server (Windows)` is deprecated and isn't 
applied anymore.
