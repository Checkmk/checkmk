Previously, some Windows network interface names with additional spaces — 
particularly before the hash symbol — were not recognized by the check engine.
This led to the absence of some services, especially Windows teaming network 
interfaces.

In this release, such interface names are handled correctly thus fixing the 
problem. Still, you may need to rediscover services again.
