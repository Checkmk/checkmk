Measure the historic utilization of Linux, Windows servers as well as VMware ESXi, Nutanix, Proxmox,
and Hyper-V hypervisors.

With this change, we ship new views calculating historic averages over the last 365 days for CPU, 
memory and filesystem utilization. These views were developed in cooperation with the Swiss Data 
Center Efficiency Association to help companies measure IT utilization in their data centers.
