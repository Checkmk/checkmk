Title: cisco_qos: Handle metric units consistently & drop averaged metrics

The two metrics produced by the Cisco QoS services (outbound and dropped bits) were displayed
inconsistently in the UI: The graph rendered the correct values in bits/s, but the values
displayed in the <i>Service Metrics</i> section were too small by a factor of 8.

Unfortunately, due to current architectural limitations, this change will lead to a loss of metric
history for users of the Checkmk Raw Edition. We apologize for this inconvenience.

Finally, as of this werk, the Cisco QoS services stop producing useless additional metrics in case
averaging is activated.
