On <tt>systemd</tt> systems, the Oracle agent plugin did not properly execute any asynchronous SQL
queries (see also <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/13732">werk #13732</a>). Furthermore, when being
called directly from the command line without any options, the plugin incorrectly reported
`Unhandled location` and terminated, even if it was located under <tt>..check_mk_agent/plugins/</tt>.
