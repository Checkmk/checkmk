A negative value for the free space is of course nonsense. However, if a device reported this,
Checkmk might have crashed with

C+:
ValueError("Cannot render negative timespan")
C-:

when attempting to compute the time left until the filesystem is full. Now, we instead report a
value of 0 seconds in this case, st. users receive informative notifications about the problem.
