Before this werk, Checkmk included the agent plugin <tt>mailman_lists</tt>, which monitored Mailman
2 mailing lists. As of this werk, Checkmk includes the plugins <tt>mailman2_lists</tt> and
<tt>mailman3_lists</tt>, which monitor Mailman 2/3 mailing lists. If the bakery is configured to
deploy the Mailman plugin, both plugins will be installed, since only one of them will be
operational, depending on the Mailman version installed on the target system.
