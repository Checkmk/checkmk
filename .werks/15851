When rendering combined graphs from views via the dropdowns <i>Hosts / Services > All metrics of
same type in one graph</i>, the context of the view was not taken into account. For example, views
can be restricted to only include services whose descriptions match a regular expression. When
rendering combined graphs from such a view, this restriction was not taken into account. Hence, the
combined graph included more objects than the original view or even reported that the object limit
for combined graphs was reached, even if the number of rows in the original view was below the
limit.

Note that this error did not occur if additional filters were applied to the view before rendering
the combined graph. In that case, the original context and the additional filters were correctly
applied to the combined graph.
