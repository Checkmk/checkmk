The AWS special agent can be configured to monitor S3 request metrics. In order for this to work,
S3 request metrics have to specifically be enabled in the AWS/S3 console, see the
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/metrics-configurations.html">AWS/S3 documentation</a>.
Note that this a paid feature. Furthermore, the filter name has to be set to <tt>EntireBucket</tt>,
as is recommended in the
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/configure-request-metrics-bucket.html">documentation for a filter that applies to all objects</a>.
The special agent will use this filter name to query S3 request metrics from the AWS API.

These prequisites are now also clearly stated in the AWS special agent configuration page.
