Values smaller than 0.0001% were displayed in scientific notation by Perf-O-Meters. Since this
notation is of limited use to most users, we instead display values using two decimal places at most
as of this werk. Hence, values smaller than 0.01% will be displayed as `<0.01%`, except for exactly
0%, which will be shown as `0%`.

The actual value of the metric can be looked up in the <i>Service Metrics</i> field of the service
details.
