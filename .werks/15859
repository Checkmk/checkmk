When a PSU monitored by the plugin <i>"Cisco Nexus Switches: State of FRU Power Supplies"</i> had no power, the service went to UNKNOWN.
It now goes CRITICAL.

In addition we changed the conditions under which a service is discovered.
Powered off FRUs in the following state have not been discovered before, but are now (quoted from the MIB):

<tt>offEnvPower(5)</tt>: FRU is powered off because of power problem in the FRU. For example, the FRU's power translation (DC-DC converter) or distribution failed.

FRUs disabled administratively are no longer discovered:

<tt>offAdmin(3): Administratively off.
