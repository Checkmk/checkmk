This Werk only affects users that have strict levels on the offset monitored by the plugin <i>"Synchronization of Operating System Time"</i> (<tt>systemtime</tt>) on <b>Windows</b>.

Affected users may have to increase their levels a bit, as they might observe an increase of the measured "offset".

The plugin used to (try to) account for the time that passed between receiving the agent data and processing it.
This is no longer done as it has been unreliable, and is no longer supported by the new API for check plugins.

Note that this should not increase the offset too much (well below a minute!).
If this results in a big increase of the measured offset for you, it might point to a different problem:
Your check helpers can not keep up with your fetchers.
