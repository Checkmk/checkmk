This changes the behavior of services processing cached data of the Linux, AIX, Solaris, FreeBSD and OpenWrt agent.

Previous to this werk, a service would go to UNKNOWN if the execution of a cached section failed, reporting <i>"Missing data"</i> or <i>"Item not found in monitoring data"</i>.
Those services now go stale, and only go to UNKNOWN after tripple the time of the caching intervall passed.
