After an upgrade various plugins metrics would misbehave, until eventually settling again.
More specificly: All averaged metrics would forget the previously recorded values.
As a result, the "averaged" metric follows the original one very closely.
After a few values are recorded the desired smoothing effect of the averaging will start to show.
The time it takes for the metric to stabilise depends on the configured or implemented weights (<i>"Backlog in minutes"</i>).
