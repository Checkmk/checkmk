Title: ucd_cpu_load: Consider the number of CPUs

The number of CPUs in <i>UCD SNMP Daemon: CPU Utilization</i> was hardcoded to 1, which is mostly wrong today.

With this Werk we count the number of CPUs by fetching {HOST-RESOURCES-V2-MIB::hrProcessorFrwID}.
If this is not available the check falls back to 1 CPU.
