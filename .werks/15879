Prior to this werk, the host_rename endpoint occasionally ran into a timeout if
the renaming process took too long. This werk introduces a background job
to resolve this issue. The endpoint now returns a redirect response instead of
the host details. An associating wait-for-completion endpoint is also introduced
to accompany the rename endpoint. Scripts should be adjusted accordingly.

Prior to this werk, the rename process was initiated by calling the endpoint:
/objects/host_config/<i>host_id</i>/actions/rename/invoke

This endpoint remains the same but the werk introduces the additional endpoint to
wait for the process' completion:
/domain-types/host_config/actions/actions/wait-for-completion/invoke
