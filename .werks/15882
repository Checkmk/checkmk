Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Component: dcd
Date: 1687511169
Edition: cee
Knowledge: doc
Level: 1
Version: 2.3.0b1

Prior to this werk, whenever the activate changes endpoint returned a 409 response
the DCD failed and logged the error without any helpful information on why this
error occurred. This werk improves the error and logging handling for this case.
