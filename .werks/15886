If-Match is most often used with state-changing methods (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE)
to prevent accidental overwrites when multiple user agents might be acting in
parallel on the same resource.

This werk introduces a mechanism to ignore or bypass this protection mechanism by
passing the special * character to the If-Match header.
