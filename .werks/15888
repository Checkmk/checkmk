Previously when calling update folder, you could pass any combination of

replace all attributes
update some attributes
delete some attributes

Some of these combinations didn't make much sense and could lead to errors.
This werk simplifies this by only allowing one of the options when calling
update folder or bulk update folders.

For update_folder, previously you could do the following

C+:
{
    "title": "Virtual Servers.",
    "attributes": {"tag_networking": "wan"},
    "update_attributes": {"tag_criticality": "prod"},
    "remove_attributes": ["tag_foobar"],
}
C-:

This werk modifies this behaviour by forcing the client to select only one action.

C+:
{
    "title": "Virtual Servers.",
    "attributes": {"tag_networking": "wan"},
}
C-:

OR

C+:
{
    "title": "Virtual Servers.",
    "update_attributes": {"tag_criticality": "prod"},
}

{
    "title": "Virtual Servers.",
