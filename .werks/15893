Previously the alerts dashboard would fetch 5 hours of alert data
by default or the time range selected by the user via the time series
graphs.  This caused performance issues since the number of alerts
could vary greatly, often resulting in timeouts. This werk addresses
this problem by introducing pagination on the backend.  We now only
fetch 20 alerts in any given api call. The user can then request more
using the next button.
