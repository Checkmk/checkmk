As mentioned in werk 15894, the reference time used to calculate the creation time of a process as displayed by the "State and Count of Processes" service is the time the agent section was parsed.
The <tt>check_mk_agent.linux</tt> agent will now also output the time at which the ps command was executed to be used as a reference instead.
The agent must be redeployed to take advantage of this change.
