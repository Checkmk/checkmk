As mentioned in werk 15894, the reference time used to calculate the creation time of a process as displayed by the "State and Count of Processes" service is the time the agent section was parsed.
The following agents will now also output the time at which the ps command was executed to be used as reference instead:

LI: check_mk_agent.aix
LI: check_mk_agent.freebsd
LI: check_mk_agent.macosx
LI: check_mk_agent.netbsd
LI: check_mk_agent.openbsd
LI: check_mk_agent.openwrt
LI: check_mk_agent.solaris

The agent must be redeployed to take advantage of this change.
