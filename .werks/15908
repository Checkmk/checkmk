Title: df: Showing wrong WARN/CRIT levels when magic factor is 1.0

When levels for free/used space were configured and the magic factor was configured to 1.0, the df check plugin was using the default parameters as WARN/CRIT levels.
This behaviour differed from 2.1 and causes the check plugin to sometimes report an incorrect state.
The problem has been fixed and the behaviour is the same as in 2.1.
