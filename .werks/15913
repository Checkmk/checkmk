If the rule 'Check SMB share access' was configured with a defined 'NetBIOS name of the server' in 2.1.0p30 and lower and an update to a higher version was attempted, it caused a rule transform error.
The error looks similar to this:
C+:
-| ERROR: Failed to transform rule: (Ruleset: active_checks:disk_smb, ...) ... is not an allowed value
-| WARNING: Invalid rule configuration detected (Ruleset: active_checks:disk_smb, Title: Check SMB share access, ...)
C-:

This has now been fixed and the transformation of the rule will not cause any problems while updating.
