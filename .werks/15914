If the rule for any mailbox related active check was configured without defining the 'server' option and an update to a higher version was attempted, it caused a rule transform error.
This caused the update to fail.
The error looks similar to this:
C+:
client_id, client_secret, tenant_id = auth_data
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)
C-:

This has now been fixed and the transformation of the rule will not cause any problems while updating.
