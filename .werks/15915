Sometimes when an oracle instance has a failure it deliveres some additional information. This information caused the failure of the section parsing.
The section in the agent output looks something like this:
C+:
<<<oracle_instance:sep(124)>>>
+ASM|FAILURE|ERROR: ORA-12541: ...

NAME DATABASE_ROLE OPEN_MODE DB_UNIQUE_NAME FLASHBACK_ON FORCE_LOGGING SWITCHOVER_STATUS
C-:
This has now been fixed and the additional information should not cause any problems.
