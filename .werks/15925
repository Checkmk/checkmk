Title: Fix selection while editing downtimes

If you edited downtimes in a distributed setup, the selection via checkboxes
was not processed correctly if downtime IDs were identical on different sites.
This resulted in editing all downtimes with the same ID even if e.g. only one
downtime was selected for editing.
