In some environments, the button "Create random secret and copy secret to
clipboard" of the option "Automation secret for machine accounts" on the users
page did not copy the secret to the clipboard.

We now use a fallback mechanism if the standard fails. If even the fallback
fails you will see a dialog were you can copy the secret manually.
