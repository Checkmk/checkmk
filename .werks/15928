Werk #15135 introduced the possibility to share views, dashboards and report
definitions.

If you cloned an installed extension and changed the configuration of the
clone, opening the view, dashboard or report always showed the configuration
of the extension.

This has been fixed, please review your shared views, dashboards and reports if
you used extensions.
