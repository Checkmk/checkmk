After update of the werkzeug module we have seen different users facing
problems while saving changes in, e.g. Business Intelligence, Dynamic host
management and Agent deployment rules. The save action always lead to an
"Internal Server Error".

Reason was a new introduced limit of the mentioned module causing this error
while saving very large formulars. So this could also occur on various other
pages.
