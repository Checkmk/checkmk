If you added the snapin "Tree of folders" to the sidebar, only the topic
dropdown with the default "Overview" was shown. The second dropdown of the view
choices was missing.

A workaround was, to change the dropdown to another topic as "Overview". The
second dropdown appeared and on change back to "Overview", you could choose a
view of this topic.

Note: This only occurs on the first use of the snapin. If you have already
selected something, the dropdown values are read from user files.
