In graph legends and mouse hovers which show the current values at a given point in time, the order
of the curves was reversed with respect to the graph definition. This affected for example the
bandwidth graph of interface services.

Note that in case the graph contains stacked metrics, we stick to the reversed order, as before.
This aligns the order of the curves in the legend and mouse hover with the order in the graph.
