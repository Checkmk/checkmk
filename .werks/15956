This werk only concerns developers of custom agent bakery plugins.

The agent bakery API, which allows for registering custom bakery plugins, is now available in the
CRE. This facilitates custom plugin development, since bakery plugins can now be developed in the
context of our GitHub repository with full IDE support. The new import path for the bakery API
reads:
C+:
from cmk.base.plugins.bakery.bakery_api.v1 import register, Plugin, ...
C-:

Note that the old import path is still valid and will continue working. Furthermore, the path in the
hierarchy of the <i>local</i> folder for custom bakery plugins remains unchanged. Hence, MKPs do not
need to be adjusted.

Finally, note that this does of course not mean that the actual bakery functionality is available in
the CRE. Registering a bakery plugin in the CRE will have no effect.
