Title: Render prediction graphs for services on remote sites
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Component: multisite

When using <a href="https://docs.checkmk.com/master/en/predictive_monitoring.html">predictive monitoring</a>,
Checkmk offers the option to
<a href="https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/predictive_monitoring.html#_analyzing_the_prognoses">display the current prediction in a graph</a>.

Before this werk, this functionality was broken for services on remote sites. For such services,
Checkmk always displayed the following error message:
<i>There is currently no prediction information available for this service.</i>

Note that for Checkmk 2.2 and 2.1, this issue is solved in <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/16093">werk 16093</a>
by linking to the remote site.
