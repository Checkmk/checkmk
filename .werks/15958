This werk only concerns developers of custom Checkmk extensions.

There are currently two ways for registering custom graph definitions:

C+:
graph_info["GRAPH_ID"] = GRAPH_DEFINITION
C-:

and

C+:
graph_info.append(GRAPH_DEFINITION)
C-:

Using the latter might have lead to duplicate graphs in the user interface. As of this werk, this is
fixed.
