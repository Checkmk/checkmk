After some security updates to the REST-API, guest users were
no longer able to view host data on monitoring endpoints due
to insufficient permissions. There is a differentiation between
'monitoring' and 'setup' endpoints with regards to permissions
which was previously not taken into account.

This werk addresses this issue by allowing monitoring read
access for guest users.
