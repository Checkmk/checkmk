Event console IDs are integers beginning from 1, both for the main site & for
remote sites.  This means that the same event console ID can exist on more
than one site at the same time. This caused problems when calling the DELETE
endpoint as we weren't sure which ID the client wanted to delete. To get around
this problem, we have introduced a "site_id" field. The site_id together with
the event console ID combination is unique and therefore solves this issue.
