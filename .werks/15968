Previously when calling update host, you could pass any combination of

replace all attributes
update some attributes
delete some attributes

Some of these combinations didn't make much sense and could lead to
errors. This werk simplifies this by only allowing one of the options
when calling update host or bulk update host.

For update_host, previously you could to the following

C+:
{
    "attributes": {"ipaddress": "192.168.9.123"},
    "update_attributes" {"ipaddress": "192.168.0.124"},
    "remove_attributes": ["tag_foobar],
}
C-:

This werk modifies this behaviour by forcing the client to select only
one action.

C+:
{
    "attributes": {"ipaddress": "192.168.9.123"},
}
C-:

OR

C+:
{
    "update_attributes": {"ipaddress": "192.168.9.124"},
}
C-:

OR

C+:
    "remove_attributes": ["tag_foobar"],
C-:
