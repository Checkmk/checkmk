mk_oracle stores the query results for SYNC_SECTIONS in intermediate cache files per SID, which will be cleaned up afterwards.
Currently, these files can be erroneously deleted before the agent plugin has finished if the agent plugin is started a second time, resulting in a "Database or necessary processes not running or login failed" error.
This has been fixed by only deleting files created by the current process.
