The speed at which changes are distributed to remote sites and activated when in a distributed setup with hundreds of sites has been improved.
This is mainly due to improved parallelization, which means that more sites can perform their activation at the same time.

The option to configure "Maximum parallel site activations" in the global settings has been removed as each site activation now uses much less memory, removing the need for limitation.
