As announced in https://checkmk.com/werk/15261, the "resource_group" host label has been replaced with the label "cmk/azure/resource_group".
Users referencing the old label have to switch to the new one since with this werk, the "resource_group" label will no longer be provided for Azure Resource Group hosts.
