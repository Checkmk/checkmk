Title: Linux+Windows agent: allow spooling plugin outputs via files
Level: 2
Component: checks

Class: feature

The Windows and Linux agent now have a new feature for sending the contents of
files as a part of the agent output. This is useful for generating monitoring
data asychronously, e.g. by a cron job.

Simply let the job create or update a file in the directory
<tt>/etc/check_mk/spool</tt> (Linux) or in the subdirection <tt>spool</tt>
of the agent directory (Windows). If that directory is missing, simply
create it. The agent will then add the contents of all files contained in
that directory to its output.  You can use any filename you like. Just files
beginning with a dot are ignored.  This is an easy way to have applications
on the host drop monitoring data into Check_MK. Especially conveniant is
using a local <tt>&lt;&lt;&lt;local&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt> section here.

If you prefix the file name with a number (e.g. <tt>600MyOutput</tt>
or <tt>3600_app_data.txt</tt>) then that number is interpreted as a
number of seconds. If the last modification of the file is older than
that number, it will be ignored. This will usually set the corresponding
services in the monitoring to <b>UNKNOWN</b>. That way you can make sure
that you will be alarmed if no fresh monitoring data is available.
