Prior to this werk, Checkmk raised an error in the following cases:

* when the user attempted to create a LDAP connection with a config with the customer option set to "Global"
* when the user attempted to change a LDAP connection config with the customer option set to "Global"
* when the user attempted to create a SAML connection config
* when the user attempted to delete an existing SAML connection config

This werk resolves these issues and Checkmk will not throw an error anymore.
