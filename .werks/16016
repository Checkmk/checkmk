The migration of the postgres_instances check plugin to the new CheckAPI broke the discovery
mechanism of the plugin as it previously allowed an instance to have no specified name. This
werk introduces the option to specify an explicit name for an instance. The mk_postgres plugin
is adjusted accordingly and raises an error if the name cannot be inferred from .env file. To
benefit from this change and also resolve the error, the user should adjust or bake the config
file again and roll out the newly adapted plugin. For manual adaptation, instance entries should
be adapted to have the following format:

<code>
INSTANCE=&lt;instance env filepath&gt;:&lt;username&gt;:&lt;instance pgpass filepath&gt;:&lt;instance name (optional)&gt;
</code>

where ':' (colon) is the respective separator character.
