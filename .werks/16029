MobileIron exists both as an on-premises and cloud version. 
The included integration only applied for MobileIron Cloud, 
which was not apparent by the name of the checks etc. 

In the meantime, MobileIron was acquired and MobileIron Cloud was 
renamed to Ivanti Neurons for MDM. This is now being properly 
reflected in Checkmk.
