The elements of the cluster overview dashboard were not sorted at all previously.
They are now sorted alphabetically. 
The sorting of the cluster and namespace dashboards was partially done on hostname, 
which leads to a sorting by namespace. To unify this behaviour, all list elements
are now sorted by name alphabetically
