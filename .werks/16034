The visualization for the rule search has been updated to provide
clearer indications of the displayed information.

The previous green overlay highlighting has been replaced by an
icon-based visualization.
Ineffective rules are denoted with a negative icon whereas
all other rule searches are marked with a green checkmark icon.

It is now clearly separated whether you are matching for a host
or searching for rules via the rule search.
