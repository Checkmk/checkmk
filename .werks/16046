The command dialog "Acknowledge problems" in views is reworked to improve usability.
The possible options are now more verbose, explaining more clearly what they do. Also, these options' defaults can be accessed directly from the command dialog via the link "Edit defaults".
The removal of acknowledgments is moved into a separate command "Remove acknowledgments" that can be found in the page menu "Commands".
