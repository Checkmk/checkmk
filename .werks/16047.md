This werk affects users who use the tags of Azure Resource Groups or Virtual Machines (if monitored as hosts) as host labels in Checkmk.
The host labels are renamed from the original Azure format "{key}":"{value}" to "cmk/azure/tag/{key}":"{value}" in order to stay consistent with other host labels and to avoid overwriting existing Checkmk labels.
Additionally, label keys and values are now validated to 1) not hold empty values - empty values are replaced by "true" and 2) not contain colons (":") - colons are replaced by underscores ("_"). So a former label "label:key":"" will now be shown as "label_key":"true".
The old labels will be removed in version 2.4.0.
