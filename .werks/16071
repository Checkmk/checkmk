If you used notification spooling and configured "Timing settings for specific
methods" in the global settings option "Notification Spooler Configuration",
the settings "Maximum number of delivery attempts" and "Timeout" had no effect.

The notification methods were executed until they succeded.

Please note:
This change can cause changes in the notification spooling, please check if the
behaviour still matches your needs. Otherwise you would have to adjust the
mentioned settings again.
