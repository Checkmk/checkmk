The wato audit log ~/var/check_mk/wato/log/wato_audit.log was not rotated
regularly. This lead to an ever growing audit log, which could not be viewed
anymore once it reached several hundred MB of log lines.

Therefore, the audit log will now rotate regularly to archive files bigger than
300MB.

Existing logfiles greater 300MB will be splitted up on update and the source
file will be backed up as wato_audit.log_backup.
