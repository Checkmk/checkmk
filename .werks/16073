Werk #16072 introduced the regulare rotating of the wato audit log.

The audit log page was now adjusted to also show archived/rotated logs.
Therefore, you are now asked to choose a file to view instead of showing the current log
on opening the page.

Besides that, the "Clear" option was renamed to "Archive" because the current
log file is archived not cleared.
