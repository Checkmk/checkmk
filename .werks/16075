Title: Notification spooler: Fix possible wrong order of notification processing
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Component: notifications

The notification spooler used the mtime of the spool files to determine the
order of execution.

In rare cases, the mtime was too imprecise so we now use the mtime in
nanoseconds.
