Title: Agent Bakery: "Bake revision" is now configurable

This Werk is incompatible only for Checkmk 2.3, while the default behavior won't
change for Checkmk 2.2 and lower.

With Checkmk 2.0/Werk #11403 we introduced a new versioning scheme for
baked agents that includes a so-called "Bake revision".<br>
However, the big downside of this approach is that agents will lose their
signature in many cases when baking new agents without signing.

With this Werk, it's possible to deactivate/activate the bake revision by configuring
the global setting <i>Setup/Apply bake revision</i>.

Additionally, when agents are baked automatically due to an active
<i>Setup/Automatically create monitoring agents</i> setting, starting with Checkmk 2.3,
the bake revision won't increase.<br>
By this, we avoid a situation where agent signatures are invalidated automatically.

<b>Breaking change</b>: Due to the feedback of many users, the default behavior will
change with Checkmk 2.3: The bake revision will be deactivated by default.<br>
If you happen to rely on the versioning scheme mentioned in Werk #11403, you have to
re-activate the bake revision manually.<br>
For Checkmk up to 2.2, the bake revision will remain activated by default.

<b>Breaking change</b>: As mentioned above, also starting with Checkmk 2.3, the bake
revision (when activated at all) won't increase when agents are baked automatically on
activate changes.<br>
If your workflow relies on a versioning scheme with bake revision <i>and</i> on automatic
baking, you have to switch to a different approach, e.g., bake agents regularly via REST-API.
