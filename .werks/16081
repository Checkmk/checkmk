The "Restricted address mismatch" accidentally triggered a warning even if the
corresponding "State in case of restricted address mismatch" entry of the
"Checkmk Agent installation auditing" rule was left unconfigured.

Additionally to the fix, this configuration test now also allows a <tt>CRIT</tt>
state instead of the default <tt>WARN</tt>.
