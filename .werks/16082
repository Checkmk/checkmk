Title: Wrong match type for "Agent controller auto-registration" ruleset
Class: fix

The match type of the "Agent controller auto-registration" ruleset accidentally showed up with the information
"Matching: Each parameter is defined by the first matching rule where that parameter is set (checked)."

This is now corrected to
"Matching: The first matching rule defines the parameter."

The wrong match type had no effect to the actual ruleset evaluation, but lead to a crash when showing the effective
rulesets for a host.
