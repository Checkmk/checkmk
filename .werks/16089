The check plugin <tt>etherbox_smoke</tt> monitors smoke sensors of Etherboxes.
<a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/14664">Werk 14664</a> introduced configurable levels for this
plugin. However, this accidentally changed the default behaviour of the plugin. Before werk 14664,
the plugin reported <i>OK</i> if no smoke was detected and <i>CRIT</i> otherwise. With werk 14664,
by default, the plugin always reported <i>CRIT</i>, even if no smoke was detected.

As of this werk, the old default behaviour is restored. Furthermore, a new configuration option is
added. Users now have two alternatives for configuring the behaviour of the plugin: Users can either
specify two monitoring states for the two cases "smoke detected" and "no smoke detected", or,
alternatively, users can specify <i>WARN</i> and <i>CRIT</i> thresholds on the smoke level.

Finally, this werk removes the option to configure predictive levels for this check plugin, which
was also added by werk 14664. Using this option lead to a crash. Already existing configurations
will automatically be migrated to the default behaviour mentioned above.
