The check plugin <tt>etherbox_voltage</tt> monitors voltage sensors of Etherboxes. By default, the
plugin reported <i>CRIT</i> for any non-zero voltage reading. As of this werk, the new default
behaviour is to apply no thresholds. Users can configure custom thresholds, as before.

Furthermore, this werk removes the option to configure predictive levels for this check plugin,
which lead to a crash. Already existing configurations will automatically be migrated to the new
default behaviour (no thresholds).
