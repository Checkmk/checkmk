Before this werk, local check services always showed all metric values in the service summary. As of
this werk, only metric values which result in a <i>WARN</i> or a <i>CRIT</i> are shown in the
service summary. All other metric values are instead shown in the service details.

Hence, if the <a href="https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/localchecks.html#dynamic_state">P</a>
state is used, metric values are displayed in the service summary if the violate the thresholds.
Without the P state, metric values are always displayed in the service details.
