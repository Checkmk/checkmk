When using <a href="https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/predictive_monitoring.html">predictive monitoring</a>,
Checkmk offers the option to
<a href="https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/predictive_monitoring.html#_analyzing_the_prognoses">display the current prediction in a graph</a>.

Before this werk, this functionality was broken for services on remote sites. For such services,
Checkmk always displayed the following error message:
<i>There is currently no prediction information available for this service.</i>

As of this werk, the prediction graph icon links to the site on which the corresponding host is
monitored, where the graph will render as expected.

Note that for Checkmk 2.3+, the rendering of prediction graphs in distributed setups is fully
supported as of <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/15957">werk 15957</a>, meaning that the icon does
not link to remote sites anymore. Instead, the graph can be rendered directly in the central site.
