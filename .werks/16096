This werk addresses an issue with regards to REST API access. When the
distributed monitoring config option

"Users are allowed to directly login into the Web GUI"

was disabled, we inadvertently blocked access to the REST API as well.
We now allow REST API access while still blocking access to the Web
GUI in this scenario.
