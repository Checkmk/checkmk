This werk addresses an issue when creating a host with custom attributes.  For
example, when you added a new tag to a tag group and then created a host with
that tag group: tag value, the created host would have this new attribute but
it wouldn't have any other attributes.

So sending this in your request, after creating the new tag 'tag1',

C+:
{
    "folder": "~",
    "host_name": "api_created_host2",
    "attributes": {
        "ipaddress": "127.0.0.1",
        "tag_agent": "no-agent",
        "tag_snmp_ds": "no-snmp",
        "tag_networking": "tag1"
        }
}
C-:

before this would create a host with the only the tag networking attribute
and ignore all others, like so

C+:
{
    ...
    "attributes" {
	"tag_networking": "tag1"
	}

C-:

Now, we return all the expected attributes.
