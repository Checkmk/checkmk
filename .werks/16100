This werk addresses an issue found by our QA team with regards to the
following endpoint

PUT /domain-types/licensing/actions/configure/invoke

Previously, we got an internal server error when attempting to call
this endpoint with no 'settings' field or with no data for the 'settings'
field.  We have now made 'settings' a required field and the correct
request data must be present.

Examples of correct request data

C+:
{
    "settings": {
        "mode": "offline"
    }
}
C-:

or

C+:
{
    "settings": {
        "mode": "online",
        "credentials": {
            "username": "application-account-id",
            "password": "application-account-password"
        }}
}
