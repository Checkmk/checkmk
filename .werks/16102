This werk addresses an issue identified by our QA team. Previously,
you could include the newline character in the 'aux_tag_id', when
creating an aux_tag via the following endpoint

/domain-types/aux_tag/collections/all

We have now made pattern matching stricter, which means that this
is no longer allowed.
