The event console already handled various non-RFC compliant syslog messages
in addition to the official RFC 3164/5424 ones, but somehow accepting e.g.
forwarded syslog messages from zypper on SLES15 requires yet another variant.
Fun fact: In addition to the 2 official correct formats, we accept 11
non-compliant formats now.
