When an SNMP trap arrives at the event console which can't be parsed for
various reasons (unknown SNMP engine ID, some deserialization error, ...),
we previously logged a full Python backtrace to the EC log.  This could lead
to the incorrect conclusion that there is something wrong with the EC
itself, which is not what has actually happened: Actually, some device was
probably misconfigured and/or misbehaving.  To avoid such log spam, such a
trap is now silently dropped at the standard "informational" log level, and
more details can be logged at higher levels when needed.
