When an user logged in via HTTP header authentication (e.g. the legacy SAML method with mod_auth_mellon) and that user had a session cookie from a previous session which is now invalid the creation of a new session was aborted.
This Werk fixes this so previous session cookies are ignored if they are invalid and a new session will be created.
