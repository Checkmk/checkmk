This werk addresses an issue identified by our QA team. Previously,
you could include the newline character in the host tag group field
'ident' when creating a host tag group via the following endpoint

/domain-types/host_tag_group/collections/all

We have now made pattern matching stricter, which means that this
is no longer allowed.
