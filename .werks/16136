Most PUT requests to the REST API require an If-Match header containing
an ETag. With this Werk we make it possible to provide "*" instead of an
ETag, like this: "If-Match": "*"

This Werk also adds a short explanation to the REST API documentation.
See the section "Updating values" for more information.
