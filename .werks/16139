This werk addresses an issues found by the QA team with regards to
the regex pattern we use to match valid PushOverPlugin api_keys
and also the user group key. Previously we used

[a-zA-Z0-9]{30}

which will match any string that has 30 or more characters and
numbers. This is partial match.

We now do the following

^[a-zA-Z0-9]{30,40}$

which will match the whole string.  We only allow characters
and numbers with the whole string having to be of length min
30 and max 40 characters.
