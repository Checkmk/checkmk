This werk addressses an issue discovered by our QA team.  When doing a bulk
update on any of the following REST-API domains, this caused an error
when you didn't provide the attributes field.

host_group_config
service_group_config
contact_group_config

This fix means that the attribute for bulk updating is now a required field.
