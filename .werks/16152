This werk addresses an issue found by our QA team when bulk deleting hosts
via the following endpoint.

/domain-types/host_config/actions/bulk-delete/invoke

The body for this endpoint requires that the entries fields is given a
list of host names that the client wants to delete. However, when
passing in an empty list, this was causing problems. To get around
this, we've set a mininum value of items for the entries field to 1.
