We recently introduced a change with werk 15966 which means that the site_id
is now required when deleting downtimes via the REST API.  However, only the
'by_id' option leaves the downtime selection ambigious, while the options
'params' or 'query' already have the ability to pinpoint the downtimes
requested, therefore, the site_id should not be required in these cases.

This werk addresses this oversight and introduces a change where the site_id
is only required when deleteing by_id.
