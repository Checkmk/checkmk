The service monitoring rule "Linux monitoring service status"
was previously being used for both Linux and OVS.  This werk
now splits this rule in two.  We now have the following rules.

Linux bonding interface status -> Linux
Bonding interface status -> OVS

The reason behind this, is that we have now introduced an
expected mode configuration parameter only for the Linux
rule. So you are now able to select the expected bonding
mode and the state you want to display when this condition
is not met.

This also means that there is a change to the configuration.
So, if you currently have the "Linux bonding interface status"
rule configured, the actions you have to take are the
following

Case 1: Rule configured for linux
Action: The config update process will handle the update.

Case 2: Rule configured for OVS
Action: All previously configured rules will now appear
as Linux Bonding interface status rules.  Therefore you
will have to delete them and create new "Bonding interface
status" rules.
