The service monitoring rule "Linux monitoring service status"
was previously being used for both Linux and OVS.  This werk
now splits this rule in two.  We now have the following rules.

Bonding interface status
OVS bonding interface status

The reason behind this, is that we have now introduced an
expected mode configuration parameter only for the Linux
rule. So you are now able to select the expected bonding
mode and the state you want to display when this condition
is not met.

Actions:

Case 1: Rule configured for linux
Action: do nothing.

Case 2: Rule configured for OVS
Action: All previously configured rules will now appear as
Linux Bonding interface status rules.  Therefore you will
have to delete them and create new "OVS Bonding interface
status" rules.
