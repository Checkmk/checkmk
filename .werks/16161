Previously, a missing datasource error would be shown in a discovery
page of a cluster host if the cluster host had 'No IP' configured
but had nodes with an agent datasource.

Services of a cluster host would also become vanished.

Checkmk now supports the described setup, there is no error in the
discovery page and clustered services are discovered.
