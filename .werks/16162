Title: discovery: better message in case of failing data sources

With the werk 15242, bulk discovery and periodic service discovery report errors
if fetching from one of the data sources failed. Additionally, autodiscovery won't make
changes to the configuration in that case.

The discovery service still showed a message 'rediscovery scheduled' which was confusing
to the users. Now, the message 'Automatic rediscovery currently not possible due to failing
data source(s). Please run service discovery manually' will be shown in case of failing data
sources.
