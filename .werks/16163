Title: jar_signature: Prevent privilege escalation to root
Class: security
Compatible: incomp
Component: checks
Date: 1702395666
Edition: cre
Level: 3
Version: 2.3.0b1

jar_signature agent plugin (configured by the 'Signatures of certificates in JAR files' bakery rule)
was vulnerable to privilege escalation to root by the oracle user.

A malicious oracle user could replace the jarsigner binary with another script and put
it in the JAVA_HOME directory. The script would be executed by the root user.

The jarsigner is now executed by the oracle user, preventing the privilege escalation.

This werk is incompatible for users that use the jar_signature plugin. Too avoid risk, users
should deploy the new version of the plugin or disable it.

This issue was found during internal review.
