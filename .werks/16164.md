Previously, the veeam_cdp_jobs would crash when receiving last
sync time from the future with a message:
```
raise ValueError("Cannot render negative timespan")
```

Now, the affected service will be in state WARN and report the following message:
```
"The timestamp of the file is in the future. Please investigate your host times"
```
