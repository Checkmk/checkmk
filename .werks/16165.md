Previously, Checkmk agents would be run with a preset LC_ALL
environment variable if neither C.UTF-8 or C.utf-8 locales were
installed.

That led to invalid agent output and crashes in section parsing
in multiple checks for some of the locales.

Linux, AIX, Solaris, FreeBSD and OpenWrt agents were affected.

Now, LC_ALL variable is set to C for the described case.
