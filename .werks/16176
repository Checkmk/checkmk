Title: postfix: Fix Postfix status monitoring for agents run in Docker
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Component: checks
Date: 1710323821
Edition: cre
Level: 1
Version: 2.2.0p26

Previously, Checkmk agent used the data from /proc to determine if Postfix instance is running.
Since docker containers don't have permissions to read /proc, the agent always reported
the Postfix instance as 'not running'.

This resulted in CRIT 'Postfix status' service even if Postfix instance was running correctly.
