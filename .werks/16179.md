Before the version 2.2.0p21, 'Time left until full' was reported to be 0 in case of
devices reporting negative free space.
With werk 16330, we stopped reporting the metric in case of very small size changes
because it lead to infinite values. With this change the behavior was unintentionally
also changed for negative free space values.
This werk restores the same functionality in case of negative free space.
