Title: cisco_temperature: Improve admin state detection

Previously the detection of the sensor admin state was implemented by comparing the interface description ifDescr with the sensor name entPhysicalName and using the interface admin state.
This does not work for different Cisco sytems, as e.g. Catalyst and ASR.
The mapping between interface and sensor is now attempted via the entAliasMappingTable (OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.2.1).
Furthermore, entPhysicalContainedIn (OID: .1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1) is used to apply the admin state to all sensors corresponding to an interface (e.g. subslots for ASR systems).

In case the entAliasMappingTable is not available or could not used for mapping, the old version is used as a fallback.
