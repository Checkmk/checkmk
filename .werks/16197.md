Currently the SNMP detection for `quantum_libsmall_status` and `quantum_libsmall_door` checks if "linux" and "library" are contained in the sysDescr and sysLocation OIDs. To make the detection more reliable, the sysObjectID is checked against the linux object identifier and the libraryProductName .1.3.6.1.4.1.3697.1.10.10.1.10.0 against "Quantum Small Library Product".
