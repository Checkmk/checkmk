Title: if_brocade: New if64 Check version for Brocade VDX Switches
Level: 2
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i3
Date: 1400499450
Class: incomp

This check does the same like the normal if64 check. The only difference is that ifName is used instead of ifDescription.
You may want to do a reinventory on broace switches, because otherwise the "Check_MK Inventory" check  (if used) will trigger warning state  
cause of unchecked services.
