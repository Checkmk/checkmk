Prior to this werk, the Runas section of the Checkmk agent
contained a wrong trailing slash which resulted in an error
with the find command. As a direct consequence, some or
potentially all Runas rules were inadvertently ignored, leading
to the plugin, not intended for root, being executed with root
privileges. This werk fixes this behaviour.
