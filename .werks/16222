Checkmk offers a method to authenticate single web requests with URL parameters (<tt>_username</tt> and <tt>_secret</tt>).

Due to some refactoring of the session handling with Checkmk 2.2 such automation requests initiated a full session.

The login for automation users was still blocked in the login screen but an authenticated request initiated a full session that could than be used to browse the Checkmk GUI like a regular user.

With this Werk that is no longer the case.

If you use this authentication method you should check if you rely on sessions for your automation users.
