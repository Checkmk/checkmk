The agent plugins mk_oracle, mk_oracle.ps1 and mk_oracle_crs were vulnerable to privilege escalation to root by the oracle user.

A malicious oracle user could replace a binary (e.g. sqlplus) with another script and put
it in the corresponding directory. The script would be executed by the root user.

All binaries, which are called by the plugins, are now checked if they need to be executed as a non-root (non-administrator under Windows) user, preventing the privilege escalation.
Affected binaries are: sqlplus, tnsping, crsctl.

<h3>Affected Versions</h3>

* 2.3.0 (beta)
* 2.2.0
* 2.1.0

<h3>Mitigations</h3>
