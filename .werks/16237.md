If you've been using mysql and the corresponding agent plugin *mk_sql*
under Windows, the plugin may have crashed and the agent output would then
show the following error:
```
<<<mysql_ping>>>
[[MySQL83]]
mysqladmin: File '\etc\check_mk\mysql.local.ini' not found (OS errno 2 - No such file or directory)
mysqladmin: [ERROR] Stopped processing the 'include' directive in file C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\config\mysql.ini at line 8.
```
Under Windows, the plugin config path `C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\config` is now used.

In contrast to the corresponding Linux plugin `mk_mysql`, the config path under Windows cannot be changed.
