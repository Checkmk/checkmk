You're affected if your aws_ec2_limits check reported "Unknown resource" and you're using "m7i.large".
The aws resource names are changing from time to time and we will need to find a more stable solution for that in the future.
But for now, this will be fixed by adding the resource name "m7i.large" to our internal list of aws resources.
