This werk affects you, in case you try to monitor your APC Rack Automatic Transfer Switch with <tt>apc_ats_status</tt>.
Previously some devices were not discovered due to a too strict scan function.
Futher, we enable monitoring other power supplies available at such devices as for example 1V and 3.3V.
This was fixed now.
