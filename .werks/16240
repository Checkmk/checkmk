You're affected if you want to monitor your CPU and the cpu check crashes with something like:

C+:
  File "/omd/sites/YOURSITE/lib/python3/cmk/base/plugins/agent_based/cpu.py", line 48, in parse_cpu
    count=int(row[3].split("/")[1]),
ValueError (invalid literal for int() with base 10: '')
C-:

We saw this happening on AIX system when the ps information cannot be obtained due to low memory.
The parsing is now more resilient against such missing data.
