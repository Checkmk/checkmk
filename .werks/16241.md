You're affected if you're monitoring your systemd units with an old agent and
your unit is missing a descpription.

Parsing may have failed with:
```
>       loaded_status, active_status, current_state, descr = remains.split(" ", 3)
E       ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 4, got 3)
```

This is fixed now.
