The agent plugin <code>mk_oracle</code> creates forked processes, e.g. from <code>sqlplus</code>. 
In order to reliable clean up stale processes, we kill now the whole process chain under AIX
which corresponds to the stored <code>PID</code>.
We introduce this only for <code>AIX</code> now as we have customers which are affected under that OS.
