The agent plugin `mk_oracle` creates forked processes, e.g. from `sqlplus`. 
In order to reliable clean up stale processes, we kill now the whole process chain under AIX
which corresponds to the stored `PID`.
We introduce this only for `AIX` now as we have customers which are affected under that OS.
