You're affected by this werk, if you are monitoring oracle databases and the agent bakery.

Since [Werk #15328](https://checkmk.com/werk/15328), the group ownership of `sqlnet.ora` can be set via the agent updater.
However, the bakery did not yet honor custom installation paths, which are set via the rule `"Installation paths for agent files (Linux, UNIX)"`.

From this werk on, the bakery and the agent updater do also set the configured group on `sqlnet.ora`.
