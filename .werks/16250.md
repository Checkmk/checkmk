This werk affects you, in case your last `ntpq` synchronization was indeed more than a year ago.

A potential check crash traceback looks like:
```
  File "/omd/sites/SITE/lib/python3/cmk/base/plugins/agent_based/ntp.py", line 67, in _ntp_fmt_time
    return int(raw)
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '3y'
```

The year case is now handled in the parse function.
