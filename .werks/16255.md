Since the update of monitoring-plugins to 2.4.0, `check_ircd` requires the perl module `IO::Socket::IP`.
As we cannot guarantee that the required perl version is available under all distros supported by Checkmk, we decided to stop shipping the plugin.

In case you need this plugin, you can install it manually to the local hierarchy of your site.
