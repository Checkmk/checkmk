This affects all users that had rules for "Mails in outgoing mail queue" configured.

To clean up inconsistencies that the new APIs no longer tolerate, we had to split the ruleset into two.

We renamed "Mails in outgoing mail queue" to "Mails in outgoing mail queue (multiple queues)" and added a new ruleset "Mails in outgoing mail queue (single queue)".
The required new rules are created automatically during upgrade, but we advise users to check if they have rules that are not needed anymore.

The plugins using the new ruleset are
 * Barracuda SPAM Firewall: Active and Deferred Mail Queue Length (`barracuda_mailqueues`)
 * Nullmailer: Mailqueue Length (`nullmailer_mailq`)
 * qmail: Mailqueue Length (`qmail_stats`)
