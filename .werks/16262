Viewing a check plugins man page using <tt>cmk -M my_check</tt> left the terminal in a bad state.
Browsing man pages using <tt>cmk -m</tt> did not work at all (still leaving the terminal in a bad state).
This is fixed.

After running the commands <tt>cmk -M my_check</tt> or <tt>cmk -m</tt> the tty was not properly restored.
Affected users can fix their prompt running <tt>stty sane</tt> or <tt>restore</tt>.
