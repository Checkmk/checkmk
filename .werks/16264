The ruleset <i>"Logwatch Event Console Forwarding"</i> is more consistent now.
The rules usually are merged, unless one of the rules configured "No forwarding", in which case the first such rule is applied.
This is fixed now, this setting is now over-ridable as all the other settings.

Existing rules are migrated automatically, the behaviour of existing rule combinations will not change.
