Title: Inconsistent Check_MK services for clusters with partial piggyback data

Clusters configured to "Use piggyback data from other hosts if present" expected piggyback data from <i>all</i> hosts, if one host had piggyback data.

This could lead to an inconsistent state where every nodes datasources were OK individually, but they would lead to a warning state on the cluster.
