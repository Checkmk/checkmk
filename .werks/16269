According to
<a href="https://forum.checkmk.com/t/survey-results-are-in-micro-survey-7-vote-for-a-date-and-time-format/40173">one of our surveys</a>,
most of our users prefer dates to be displayed in the format <i>YYYY-MM-DD</i>.
This Werk changes the library function that many check plugins use when rendering their service summary.

As a result, the service output of many plugins will now format the date in the new format.
For instance the next Interantional Talk Like a Pirate Day will no longer be rendered as "Sep 19 2024", but as "2024-09-19".

The following plugins are affected:

LI: Checkmk Agent: Deployment properties
LI: Checkmk: Performance and Settings
LI: Job Monitoring
LI: Kaspersky Anti-Virus: Updates (KESL)
LI: Kubernetes: Pod Containers
LI: Microsoft Azure Resource Health
LI: Microsoft Azure Virtual Network Gateways: Connections
LI: MS SQL Tablespaces: Successful Backups
LI: Nutanix Prism: Alerts
LI: Nutanix Prism: Hosts
LI: Oracle Database: Number of Active Sessions
LI: SAP HANA: Backup
LI: Virtual Machine under ESX: Snapshot Settings
