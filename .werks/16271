Title: logwatch_ec: Duplicate messages forwarded to event console

This fixes duplicate messages forwarded to the event console by the plugin <i>"Forward Logwatch Messages to the Event Console"</i> (<tt>logwatch_ec</tt>).
It only affects users that configured it to monitore multiple logfiles in one common service.

Users who need an instant solution and cannot wait for the next patch release can change their settings to mitigate the issue.
By checking <i>"Create a separate check for each logfile"</i> in the relevant <i>"Logwatch Event Console Forwarding"</i> rule and rediscovering the host you can switch to a configuration that is not affected.
