Title: Local privilege escalation in agent plugin 'mk_tsm'
Class: security
Compatible: incomp
Component: checks

Edition: cre
Level: 1
Version: 2.1.0p38

By crafting a malicious command that then shows up in the output of <code>ps</code> users of monitored hosts could gain root privileges.
This was achieved by exploiting the insufficient quoting when using ksh's <code>eval</code> to create the required environment.

This issue was found during internal review.
