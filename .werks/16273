Title: Local privilege escalation in agent plugin 'mk_tsm'
Class: security
Compatible: incomp
Component: checks
Date: 1702411459
Edition: cre
Level: 1
Version: 2.3.0b1

By crafting a malicious command that then shows up in the output of `ps` users of monitored hosts could gain root privileges.
This was achieved by exploiting the insufficient quoting when using ksh's `eval` to create the required environment.

This issue was found during internal review.


### Affected Versions

 * 2.2.0
 * 2.1.0
 * 2.0.0 (EOL) and older


### Mitigations

If updating is not possible, disable the Tivoli Storage Manager plugin.


### Vulnerability Management

We have rated the issue with a CVSS score of 8.8 (High) with the following CVSS vector:
`CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H`

We have assigned `CVE-2023-6735`.


### Changes

With this change we no longer use `eval` and fixe the quoting.
This prevents variable exports being missinterpreted as commands to execute.
