This fixes some unusable services of the "HPE Proliant Servers: Raid Status" plugin.
This werk only affecs you if you observe unknown "Logical device &lt;ITEM&gt;" services after the upgrade.

In case you are affected please run a discovery on the affected hosts and fix the monitoring history as described below.

We observed some devices to send <tt>"\x00"</tt> (the null-byte) as their name (OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.232.3.2.3.1.1.14).

Not all components delt well with it, leading to unacknowlegable downtimes, non matching rules and the like.
We now replace all null-bytes with <tt>"\\x00"</tt> (the literal containing the four characters backslash, 'x', 'zero', 'zero').

As of Checkmk 2.3, this should in fact no longer be necessary, but as we need a backportable solution, we change the item consistently in all versions.

If this affects you, you might also want to fix the services in the monitring history by running

sed -i 's|\x00|\\x00|' var/check_mk/core/history var/check_mk/core/archive/*
