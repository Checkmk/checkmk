This affects all users that had rules for "Main memory usage of simple devices" configured.

To clean up inconsistencies that the new APIs no longer tolerate, we had to split the ruleset into two.

We renamed "Main memory usage of simple devices" to "Main memory usage of simple devices with multiple services" and added a new ruleset "Main memory usage of simple devices with single services".
The required new rules are created automatically during upgrade, but we advise users to check if they have rules that are not needed anymore.

The plugins using the new ruleset are
 * Check Point Firewalls: Memory Usage (`checkpoint_memory`)
 * HPE Procurve Switches: Memory Usage (`hp_procurve_mem`)
 * UCD SNMP Daemon: Memory Check (`ucd_mem`)
