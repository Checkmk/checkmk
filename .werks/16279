Title: service_discovery: redirect response header incorrectly configured to an absolute URI

When calling the service discovery endpoint, the redirect response
header 'location' was set to an absolute URI, when it should be a
relative URI.

This werk addresses this issue by setting the URI correctly in the
redirect responses.
