This werk addresses an issue found by our QA team on the
rules collection POST endpoint

...domain-types/rule/collections/all

The match_on field requires a list of strings but didn't
enforce any length.  Previously, passing an empty string
would provoke a crash.  We now enforce a minimum string
length of 1.
