This werk introduces a new endpoint which replicates the following endpoint

POST - /domain-types/bi_aggregation/actions/aggregation_state/invoke

We now provide the same behaviour via a GET endpoint.

GET - /domain-types/bi_aggregation/actions/aggregation_state/invoke

This means that the parameters "filter_names" and "filter_groups" which
are passed as request parameters for the POST endpoint, have to be passed
as query parameters for this new GET endpoint.
