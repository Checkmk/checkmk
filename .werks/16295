With this werk the postfix status service is not discovered if Postfix is not running.
The default mail queue is now discovered as "Postfix Status default".

In order to make the check plugin work you have to perform a re-discovery on the affected hosts.
Otherwise, the service "Postfix Status" (dicovered before this change) will stop working.
