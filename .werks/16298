Title: Avoid duplicate port allocations within the same site

When configuring ports via <tt>omd config</tt>, Checkmk checks if the configured port is already in
use, both by the same site and by other sites. The check if the port is already in use by another
process of the same site was broken, which could lead to duplicate port allocations within a site.
