The command dialog for setting downtimes in views was reworked to improve
usability.

The different options can now be set from the top to the bottom and only one
submit button is used to schedule a downtime.

Preset durations can be set within the section "Duration". Own presets can be
set via the "Edit presets" link.
The start and end time can no optionally be set via a time- and datepicker.
Advanced options are bundled within an own section.
