Previously, you could only test your notification rulesets using the "Analyze"
option against a limited set of notifications in the backlog or with the "Fake
check result" command.

We now introduce the possibility to define a custom notification and test it
against your rulesets. The option can be found in "Setup" - "Notifications" -
"Test notifications".

In the popup, select whether you want to test on a host or a service
notification. Select the host and service (if you want to test on a service
notification) and the type of simulation. Currently supported are 'Start of
downtime" and "Status change". Optionally, you can specify a custom plugin
output.

A checkbox allows you to decide whether to test only (default) or to send a
real notification according to your notification rules.

Within the 'Advanced condition simulation' options you can set a custom
notification date and time to test period matching and the notification number.
