This option is used in the service discovery rule "Periodic service discovery"
and the global option "Bulk discovery" and offers now the possibility to choose
between a refresh of all services and host labels or a custom configuration. If
you choose a custom one, you can select "Monitor undecided services", "Remove
vanished services" and/or "Update host labels".
