Sometimes the battery voltage was not available or it wasn't a number. That cause the parsing of the section to fail.
This has now been fixed.
In the case of voltage being: 'External Battery: absence", the check status will be OK and the summary will provide details that the battery is absent.
If the voltage is not a number or is not absent, the voltage check will be skipped and the check result will the battery state.
