Sometimes the Lancom routers don't provide a name. During data parsing this caused the description to be left as an empty string.
As a result of that, when the router description was configured to be used for the Service Desciption, the discovery did not work properly.
This has now been fixed by having a fallback mechanism. If the router name is not present, the router description will be used.
Because of the change, the user is required to execute the service discovery again in order to discover any new services.
As well as get rid of any vanished services.
