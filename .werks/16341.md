When the Robotmk Core MKP is installed, RCC Suites configuration and RCC Profile configuration are not available as they are Enterprise features.
Previously, there were scenarios where RCC suites were running even though the Robotmk Core MKP was installed.
The Agent Bakery would use previously saved Enterprise configurations without first migrating them to their CoreMode counterparts.

This has now been fixed and the licensing mode is checked when the agent is baked. This means the RCC Suites/RCC Profile configuration will be ignored during the bake process.
This prevents users from inadvertently relying on a paid feature when CoreMode is enabled.
