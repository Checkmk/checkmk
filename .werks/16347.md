Before this werk, certain keyword runtime metrics were missing the output of the RMK test services.
This applied to both high-level and regex-matched keywords.
Specifically, this issue affected keywords nested in a TRY statement.
As a result of this werk, new keyword runtime metrics may appear in the test services.
Also, the names of existing metrics may change due to shifts in the underlying keyword IDs.
