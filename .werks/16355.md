When using Checkmk in a language other than English, the list views for graph collections, graph
tunings, custom graphs and forecast graphs might have displayed strange help texts such as
"Project-Id-Version: Checkmk user interface translation 0.1 ...".

This happened only for graph objects with empty descriptions and only if the inline help was
activated for the corresponding page.
