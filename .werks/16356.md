This werk only affects users who have configured the rule *Robotmk scheduler (Windows)* during the
2.3.0 beta phase. The following incompatible changes have been made:

* The plan naming convention introduced in [werk 16421](https://checkmk.com/werk/16421) has been adopted in more places, both internally and user-facing.
* The service items of the *RMK Plan* and *RMK Test* services have been reworked to include the name of the corresponding top-level Robot Framework suite.
* Previously, the scheduler terminated in case of permission issues for example with its working directory. As of this werk, the scheduler instead skips affected plans and forwards these issues to the Checkmk server, where they are reported to the user.

After updating, the *RMK scheduler status* service will report UNKNOWN. The plan and test services
will go stale. Furthermore, the *Check_MK* service will report that there is monitoring data missing
for the plugins `robotmk_plan` and `robotmk_test`. To remedy these issues, users first have to re-
bake and then update the Checkmk agent on affected systems. After updating the agent, users have to
re-discover the services of affected Checkmk hosts.
