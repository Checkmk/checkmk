The active certificate check (configured via the ruleset *Check certificates*) did not check the
common name (CN) of the certificate issuer correctly:

* If only the checking of the issuer CN was activated, the CN of the subject was checked instead.
* If both the checking of the issuer and the subject CN where activated, the active check crashed with\
<code>error: the argument '--subject-cn \<SUBJECT_CN\>' cannot be used multiple times.</code>
