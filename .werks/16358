Version: 2.3.0b1

To mitigate the risk of a session takeover you can now define a maximum session duration.
This is set by default to 24 hours.
For the case that somebody is actively using the session over this duration you can also configure a threshold to warn users about the upcoming session termination.
This value is set by default to 15 minutes.

You can disable this feature completely via the global setting *Session management*.
