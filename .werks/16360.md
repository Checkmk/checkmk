To make it easier to detect certain security relevant events a dedicated security log is introduced. You can find it in `var/log/security.log`.

The format of each line is:

1. The date and time the logentry was created (local time)
2. The security domain and the process id.
3. The message as json with a `summary` and `details` key. The contents of the `details` vary by the domain.

Currently the following domains exist:

* `application_errors`: e.g if a CSRF token could not be found/validated
* `auth`: e.g. successful / unsuccessful authentication attempts. (Successful authentication attempts without opening a session are currently not logged.)
* `service`: e.g. the start of a site
* `user_management`: e.g. change of a password

Please note that this logfile is still subject to change. Additional events might be added and details may change with p-releases.
