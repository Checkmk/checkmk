Prior to this Werk, the running version of Checkmk was used to display
the version of the agents. This caused that after updating Checkmk to a
new version, the wrong version of the agents was displayed until they
were baked again.

To fix this bug, the agent version is now displayed instead of the
Checkmk version.
