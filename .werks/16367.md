Since the DELETE method actually archives the audit_log entries, this endpoint is
replaced by domain-types/audit_log/actions/archive/invoke 

The DELETE endpoint is deprecated and will be removed on version 2.4.0. 

In order to update their scripts, users should replace
curl -x DELETE http://host/site/api/1.0/domain-types/audit_log/collections/all 

with
curl -x POST http://host/site/api/1.0/domain-types/audit_log/actions/archive/invoke
