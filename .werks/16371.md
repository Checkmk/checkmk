Before this werk, when the sla was computed for a predefined time 
range without specifying the range field, an error status 500 
Internal Server Error was returned. This werk solves the problem 
by checking for the existence of the range field, and if it does 
not exist, the endpoint returns an error status 400 - Bad Request.
