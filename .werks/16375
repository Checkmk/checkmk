Title: Rule "Check Email": Allow all makros

The ruleset "Check Email" recently featured stricter validation.
As a result, no makros (like <code>$HOSTNAME$</code>) could be used anymore.
This was partially compensated for in <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/15203">#15203</a>, but this was still too restrictive.
Users can now configure validated host adresses or unvalidated strings containing macros.
