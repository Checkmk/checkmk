The ruleset "Check Email" recently featured stricter validation.
As a result, macros (like `$HOSTNAME$`) could not be used anymore.
This was partially compensated for in [#15203](https://checkmk.com/werk/15203), but this was still too restrictive.
Users can now configure validated host adresses or unvalidated strings containing macros.
