This affects users monitoring hosts that run one single postfix instance.

For new installations, the service "Postfix Queue" will be renamed to "Postfix Queue default".

In general, Checkmk is able to monitor multiple postfix instances running on the monitored host.
This will change the name in the common case where users are not running multiple postfix instances, but only the "default" one.
If you want to switch to the new service description after an upgrade, you can do so using the setting "Use new service descriptions".
Be aware that you will lose the historic data in case you do that.
