It was impossible to disable bulkwalks for SNMP version 3 hosts using the inline SNMP backend.
It is fixed now in the sense that it works as in the classic backend:
In order to disable bulkwalks <b>for SNMP version 3</b> hosts, you need to make sure they do <b>not</b> match the ruleset "Enable SNMPv2c and bulkwalk for host".

A more thorough fix for this bug and the related phrasing in the rulesets is implemented in for Checkmk 2.3, but it was too risky to port into the stable releases.
See <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/16382">Werk #16382</a> for more on that.
