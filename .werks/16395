In Werk <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/16276">#16276</a>, we replaced the "less than" comparison by the
"less or equal" comparison.  This is not consistent with how Checkmk handles lower levels, despite
what the Werk claims.  This Werk restores the old behavior before Werk
<a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/16276">#16276</a>. Note, that Werk <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/16276">#16276</a>
also uncovered some Cisco devices, which report faulty thresholds for "less or equal". These
thresholds are now ignored again.
