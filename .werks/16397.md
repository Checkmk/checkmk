Previously, the agent special_zerto would show the following error message in the Check_MK HW/SW
Inventory
```
NOOPParser: Ignoring invalid data b'<<<zerto_agent:sep(0)>>>Initialized OK<<<<host1.example.com>>>>
```
Moreover, the service `Zerto Agent Status` was not discoverable and some piggyback data would
incorrectly be mapped to the source host. This is now fixed.
