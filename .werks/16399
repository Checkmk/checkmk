Title: omd update: Abort with Exit Code 1 if "Executing ... script" Fails
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Component: omd
Date: 1706108952
Edition: cre
Level: 2
Version: 2.1.0p39

The command `omd update` triggers multiple scripts during the updating process (e.g.,
01_mkp-disable-outdated, 02_cmk-update-config). Failures of this sort require manual intervention.
`omd update` notifies the user of this, by printing the following error.
```
ERROR (exit code: 1)
```
During an update to a version lower than 2.1.0p39, `omd update` proceeds with the next steps
and then exits with the exit code 0.
If updating to Checkmk 2.1.0p39, 2.2.0 or later the update is aborted upon encountering such an
error. Moreover, `omd update` terminates with exit code 1.
