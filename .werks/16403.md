A `rulespec` may have an `item_spec` without a title. In
[Werk #13387](https://checkmk.com/werk/13387) changed it so that if this title is missing the
the following crash occurs.
```
assert self._rulespec.item_name is not None
```
The occured if one navigates to the parameters via `Parameters for this service` and clicks
`Parameters`. It is now fixed.
