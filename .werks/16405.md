During `cmk-update-config` can prompt you with questions about how to continue the update. This
is an example.
```
Exception while trying to load rulesets:

You can abort the update process (A) and try to fix the incompatibilities or try to continue the update (c).
Abort update? [A/c]
```
Previously, these prompts would read input, which was typed before the prompt was shown. Now, only
the input is read after the prompt is shown.
