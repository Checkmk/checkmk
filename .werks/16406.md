While upgrading with `cmk-update-config`, the user can be prompted with questions about the next
update steps. This questioning can be disabled by using one of the conflict options `install`,
`keepold` or `abort`. Due to a regression in the 2.3.0b1 the options `install` and `keepold` do not
supress these questions. In particular, if there is a problem while `Verifying the Checkmk
configuration...`, then the update of Checkmk on Checkmk appliances will exit with a traceback.
Upgrading to the 2.3.0b1 is thus only possible here, if all problems are fixed beforehand.
