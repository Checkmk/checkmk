The `omd update` command has the capability to undo the changes it has done up until `Verifying
Checkmk configuration...`. However, if any change after `Verifying Checkmk configuration...` is
persisted. Due to a regression caused by Werk #15725, the file `config.pb` is deleted during this
verification. If the update aborts during the verification, then users will see the following error:
```
Starting cmc...Failed (Config /omd/sites/prod_dmz/var/check_mk/core/config.pb missing, run "cmk -U" and try again)
```
With this Werk, `config.pb` will be deleting only while `Updating Checkmk configuration...`.
