Sites may have configuration, MKPs and other local files, which are incompatible with the version
targeted by `omd update`. If such a problem occurs, then aborting the update may be necessary. In
earlier versions, users were advised to perform a downgrade, which was not user-friendly and had
several pitfalls. Downgrading is not supported as it has many potential downsides. With this Werk,
`omd update` is better able to deal with these situations. `omd update` will show the message
```
Completed verifying site configuration. Your site now has version {target version}.
```
If the update is aborted before this message is shown, then the site is restored to it's previous
state. This includes selecting the `abort` option, unexpected internal errors, or aborting the
update using CTRL-C.
