Jolokia 2.0 was released 2023-12-19. With the release some changes to the Jolokia Protocol have been
introduced. If a user installed this version of Jolokia, the check plugin `jolokia_info` showed
`unknown` instead of the product information. After updating the agent plugin `mk_jolokia.py`, the
correct information will be shown again.
