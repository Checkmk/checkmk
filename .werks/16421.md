This Werk affects users, who have configured the rule `Robotmk Scheduler (Windows)` during the 2.3.0
beta. The naming conventions of the check plugin `robotmk_suite` have been reworked.

* Plugin was renamed from `robotmk_suite` to `robotmk_plan`.
* Service label value changed from `cmk/rmk/type:suite` to `cmk/rmk/type:plan`.
* The service item has changed it's suffix from `Suite` to `Plan`.

Users affected by this change must run re-discovery.
