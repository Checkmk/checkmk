Previously, using the command `omd config set APACHE_TCP_ADDR` with a IPv6 address would fail. For
example, the command
```
$ omd config set APACHE_TCP_ADDR "[::]"
```
resulted in `Invalid value for '[::]'. Does not match allowed pattern.`

With this Werk, it `omd` only checks that a `Listen` directive for Apache can be constructed from the
`APACHE_TCP_ADDR`. In particular, this a IPv6 address can be configured. Such an address must be
surrounded by square brackets.
