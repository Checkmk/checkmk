This Werk affects users, which have installed an MKP with an unloadable `ValueSpec` definition.

During the update process this `ValueSpec` will be loaded in order to apply an update to the
corresponding rulesets. Previously, any error would cause the `RuleSet` UpdateAction to fail.
With this Werk, the faulty `Ruleset` is skipped. Moreover, while `Verifying Checkmk
configuration` the user is prompted with the error and can safely abort the update.

This change also affects the rulesets shipped with Checkmk. However, in case a ruleset fails in this
way, please report the error. This way we can address the error in the ruleset itself.
