Title: veeam_jobs: Always Monitor Result of Last Backup

Previously, the check plugin <code>veeam_jobs</code> would not always check the result of
the last backup job to determine the monitoring state. If the creation time was
an empty string, it would show <code>item not found</code> in case. It will now show all
the information available and the correct monitoring state.
