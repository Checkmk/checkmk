Title: veeam_jobs: Always Monitor Result of Last Backup

Previously, the check plugin <code>veeam_jobs</code> would not always check the result of
the last backup job to determine the monitoring state. If the creation time was
an empty string, it would show <code>item not found</code>. Moreover, if the last
state of the plugin was <code>Starting</code>, <code>Working</code> or <code>Postprocessing</code>, then the
check would be OK, even if the last backup failed.

The check now shows all the information available unconditionally. Moreover,

<ul>
<li> a Success result is OK,</li>
<li> a Warning result is WARN,</li>
<li> a Failed result is CRIT,</li>
<li> a None result is OK or UNKNOWN. There is no change in behaviour in this case.</li>
</ul>
