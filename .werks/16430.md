Previously, the check plugin `veeam_jobs` would not always check the result of
the last backup job to determine the monitoring state. If the creation time was
an empty string, it would show `item not found`. Moreover, if the last
state of the plugin was `Starting`, `Working` or `Postprocessing`, then the
check would be OK, even if the last backup failed.

The check now shows all the information available unconditionally. Moreover,

* a Success result is OK,
* a Warning result is WARN,
* a Failed result is CRIT,
* a None result is OK or UNKNOWN. There is no change in behaviour in this case.
