Cisco SNMP devices may report temperatures of "inf" or "-inf". According to
CISCO-ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB, these values are not valid.

Previously, Checkmk would treat non-finite temperatures as valid. This invalid
data would be written to `tmp/check_mk/counters/`, which then caused the
`Check_MK` service to become UNKNOWN. Furthermore, the services on the host
would become stale. With this Werk, the problematic values not persisted. Only
the affected service state will be UNKNOWN.

If you are affected, you can delete the corrupted counter file in
`tmp/check_mk/counters/<host name>`. To fix the readings reported by your
device, please directly contact Cisco.
