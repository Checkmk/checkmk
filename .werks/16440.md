This error affects users, which use the `Kubernetes` special agent, and have
enabled the option `Persistent Volume Claims`. It is a regression, which was
introduced in Checkmk version 2.3.0.  Previously, the agent could crash with the
following error.
```
  File "/omd/sites/cmksite/lib/python3/cmk/special_agents/utils_kubernetes/transform_any.py", line 39, in _parse_metric_sample_with_labels
    value_string, *_optional_timestamp = timestamped_value.strip().split()
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected at least 1, got 0)
```
This error occured sporadically, if the agent was unable to contact the
`kubelet` via the Kubernets API. The error is now reported via the `Kubelet`
Service. This is the same behaviour as in Checkmk 2.2.0.
