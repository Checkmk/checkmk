This problem applies to users, which have installed the first released version
of Checkmk 2.3.0 (`2.3.0.cee`). Previously, running the command `omd cleanup`
would show the following message.
```
2.3.0.cee            Could not determine package. Keeping this version.
```
This meant the corresponding package could not be cleaned up automatically.
With this version of OMD, this is done automatically.
