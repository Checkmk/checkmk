This problem affected users of the Kubernetes monitoring. Previously, the duration of a PodCondition
would sometimes be reported incorrectly. This affected PodConditions, for which no data was provided
by the Kubernetes API. The check would incorrectly report the duration of the previous PodCondition
instead. This has been fixed.
