Previously, pagetypes (bookmarks, custom graphs, topics etc.) were falsely
handled as public, rather than private. Items published only to specific groups
are not affected and were handled correctly.

This change may cause users to no longer see public overwrites by admins for
example. Please ensure your permissions and publish states are configured
correctly.
