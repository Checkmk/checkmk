In [Werk #13729](https://checkmk.com/werk/13729) support for labels in CSV
exports was removed (among other things). Instead, for affected columns a
constant `"NOT_CSV_EXPORTABLE"` value was exported.

This change reintroduces host & service labels as JSON serialized strings. This
only relates to CSV exports, other formats are not affected.

Sample export:
```csv
"host";"host_labels"
"test";"{""cmk\/os_platform"": ""linux"", ""cmk\/os_family"": ""linux"", ""cmk\/check_mk_server"": ""yes"", ""cmk\/site"": ""test""}"
"dummy";"{""my_label"": ""works""}"
"nothing";"{}"
```
