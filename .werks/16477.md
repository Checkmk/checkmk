This Werk fixes a crash in the Nutanix "NTNX Storage", "Storage Pool"
and "Container" services.

It also adds the option to update the naming of the "Prism Alerts",
"Prism Cluster", "Container" and "Storage Pool" services to be more consistent
with the other Nutanix services. The new names will be automatically used in new
installations.
