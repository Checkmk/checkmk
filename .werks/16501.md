Werk 15724 introduces a mechanism for regenerating the API specification,
which, in certain instances, is executed as a background job due to the
potential time required for completion. This update introduces a command
to trigger the background job for the regeneration of the API specification.
Users should be aware that triggering the job does not result
in immediate availability of the updated documentation; there may be a
delay before the documentation is updated. This saves the user from having
to trigger and wait for the specification regeneration manually.
