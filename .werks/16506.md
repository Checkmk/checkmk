There was a problem during service discovery which prevented Checkmk
from assigning the AWS EC2 and ELB tags delivered by the AWS agent to
their respective piggyback hosts. This werk fixes the discovery process
such that the data is parsed properly and custom tags from AWS will
now show up as host labels on the created piggyback hosts.
