On some Solaris 10 systems, an agent update did crash with error message

C+:
/var/sadm/pkg/check-mk-agent/install/postremove: syntax error at line 19: `(' unexpected
pkgrm: ERROR: postremove script did not complete successfully
C-:

If you ran into this error, to make the update perform again, please delete the file
<code>/var/sadm/pkg/check-mk-agent/install/postremove</code> on affected systems.

Technical background:\
The postremove script used the subshell evaluation syntax <code>$(...)</code> that is incompatible to the standard <code>bin/sh</code> shell found on some Solaris 10 systems.
