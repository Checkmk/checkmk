On some Solaris 10 systems, an agent update did crash with error message
```
/var/sadm/pkg/check-mk-agent/install/postremove: syntax error at line 19: `(' unexpected
pkgrm: ERROR: postremove script did not complete successfully
```

If you ran into this error, to make the update perform again, please delete the file
`/var/sadm/pkg/check-mk-agent/install/postremove` on affected systems.

Technical background:\
The postremove script used the subshell evaluation syntax `$(...)` that is incompatible to the standard `bin/sh` shell found on some Solaris 10 systems.
