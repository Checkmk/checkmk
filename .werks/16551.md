After cloning a site with `omd cp` or renaming it with `omd mv`, opening the agent bakery GUI
did result in a crash, showing a message like
```
Internal error: '/omd/sites/SITE/share/check_mk/agents/check_mk_agent.linux' is not in the subpath of '/omd/sites/SITE_COPY/share/check_mk/agents' OR one path is relative and the other is absolute.
```

As a workaround, you can delete the file `~/var/check_mk/wato/bakery_file_status.mk`
on the site.
