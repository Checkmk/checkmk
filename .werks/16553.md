Previously, the active check "HTTP web service" failed to parse the site's
password store when there was at least one stored password containing whitespaces.

This was observable when configuring "Authentication" with a password from password store,
and resulted in a *CRIT* state and an error message like
```
error: invalid value 'http_pass' for '--auth-pw-pwstore <AUTH_PW_PWSTORE>': Can't parse password store: Unexpected format.
```
in the service's summary.
