This is a regression since Checkmk 2.2.0.

When configuring the Service Monitoring Rule "Filesystems (used space and growth)",
configured levels for free space were evaluated incorrectly.

As a result, affected services erroneously showed up as *CRIT*.

This happened because of a wrong rounding while evaluating the levels, and only affected
small filesystems with a size below 1MB.
