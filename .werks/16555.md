This is a regression since Checkmk 2.3.0.

When configuring the rule _Microsoft Hyper-V Server VM state_ with option
_Translation of VM state to monitoring state: Direct mapping of VM state to monitoring state_,
the matching _VM_ services previously showed up with status _UNKNOWN_ for all VM states that were not
explicitly configured by the rule.
