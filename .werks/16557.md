This Werk fixes a regression that got introduced with Checkmk 2.2.

When using the agent bakery and (automatically) downloading agent packages from a remote site,
the remote site caches the provided packages until they are invalidated by the central site.
This happens automatically on every call from the agent updater.

This mechanism recently failed to delete unneeded cached packages from the remote site, leading
to an increased disk usage.

The regression that lead to this behavior also lead to a significantly decreased performance when
querying the remote site from multiple agent updates at once.
This is also fixed with this Werk.
