The automatic host registration and removal jobs are executed regularly in the
background to add or remove hosts. These are fundamental mechanisms to the
automatic host registration.

The jobs failed completely in case one remote site was configured but not logged
in, not only affecting the not logged in site, but all sites. The not logged in
site is now being skipped, leaving the mechanism intact for all other sites.
