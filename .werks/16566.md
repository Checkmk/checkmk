The notification spoolers log level was configured differently than other
services. Previously users had the choice between:

* Normal logging (only startup, shutdown and errors)
* Verbose logging (also spooled notifications)
* Debugging (log every single action)

This was changed to the standard log levels which we also use in all other services.

The command line flag `-v` of the `mknotifyd`, which could be used to override
the configured log level was replaced with the `--log-level=LEVEL` argument.
While the change to this command line flag is an incompatible change, we don't
rate this as a change that is worth marking the werk to be incompatible. In the
end it's only an option used for manual debugging.
