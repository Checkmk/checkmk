With werk #4118 we added the capability to gather BI aggregation states from
Checkmk installations which are using Kerberos for authentication in the UI.
This feature requires various security related depdenencies which are not used
by any other feature. This requires some additional maintenance work we
continously had to invest. We now decided to drop the support for using Kerberos
authentication, which does not mean that you can not use the plugin in Kerberos
setups. See below on how to properly adapt your configuration.

Our documented [Kerberos
setup](https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/kerberos.html) is not affected by this
change. It will keep working as before.

If you had configure before, please adapt your Kerberos configuration to use
the same exclude (`! %{REQUEST_URI} -strmatch '/${SITE}/check_mk/api/*' && \`)
as we use in the documented setup and change the "Authentication mode" setting of
the "Check State of BI Aggregation" rule to "Authorization header" or disable
the option, which then defaults to the header authentication mode.
