In all previous Checkmk versions the Checkmk packages deployed two types of init
scripts:

* The global `omd` init script
* The version specific `check-mk-<EDITION>-<VERSION>` init script

This had an effect on systemd environments as well, which also had a
`omd.service` unit and a `check-mk-<EDITION>-<VERSION>.service` unit.

This change now removes the version specific init script and units to make the
situation less confusing.

This change only affects Debian and Ubuntu. All other distros only deployed the
global init script or systemd service unit.
