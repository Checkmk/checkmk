Fix a bug in the core configuration generation that caused an error when the
"Service period for services" or "Service period for hosts" rule sets were
configured with the Checkmk Raw Edition. In this case activate changes, more
specifically the computation of the core configuration failed with the
following error:

```
Error: Invalid host object directive 'service_period'".
```
