When using the setup search as non-admin user, a search could result in a crash
report with the message "Internal error: You called this page with an invalid
host name". This was caused during the computation of a single host search
result and subsequentially made the whole search fail. The error handling has
now been changed so that only the faulty search result is skipped.
