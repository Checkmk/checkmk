You can now monitor _Redfish_ compatible management boards / BMCs with Checkmk.
To do so, please enable the natively shipped MKP redfish in _Setup --> Extension packages_ (in commercial editions of Checkmk) or via the command line tool `mkp` (in Checkmk Raw).
This will enable a new datasource program under _Setup --> Other integrations --> Redfish Compatible Management Controller_.
This is an experimental integration created and supported by the Checkmk community (Andreas DÃ¶hler/Yogibaer75), which has already been tested in many environments.
However, due to the diverse nature of server hardware, we plan to integrate it entirely for Checkmk 2.4.0, once we have gathered further feedback.

You can find the latest versions of the extensions in [Andreas' GitHub repository](https://github.com/Yogibaer75/Check_MK-Things/tree/master/check%20plugins%202.3/redfish). There you can also raise issues or raise pull requests until the plug-ins will be mainlined into Checkmk.
