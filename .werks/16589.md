You can now monitor _Redfish_ compatible management boards / BMCs with Checkmk.
To do so, please enable the natively shipped MKP redfish in _Setup --> Extension packages_ (in commercial editions of Checkmk) or via the command line tool `mkp` (in Checkmk Raw).
This will enable a new datasource program under _Setup --> Other integrations --> Redfish Compatible Management Controller_.
This is an experimental integration created by the Checkmk community (Andreas DÃ¶hler from Bechtle), which has already been tested in many environments.
However, due to the diverse nature of server hardware, we plan to integrate it entirely for Checkmk 2.4.0, once we have gathered further feedback.
