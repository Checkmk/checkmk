The Jenkins check has been extended in order to be able to present metrics about threads, memory and active HTTP requests.

The metric collection is done through a plugin called _Metrics_, which has to be installed in Jenkins in order to make the data available.
Because of these additional requirements the metric collection has to be manually enabled in the checkmk Jenkins integration configuration.
Please note that the proper retrieval of information requires the monitoring user to have the _view_ permission for _Metrics_.

Metrics will show up as new services.
