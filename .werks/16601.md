The McAfee Web Gateway has been rebranded to Skyhigh Secure Web Gateway with its release 12.2.2.
The base OID has been changed from `.1.3.6.1.4.1.1230*` to `.1.3.6.1.4.1.59732*`.

Where possibile the "McAfee" string has been removed in favor of more generic therms.
The old plugin names and ruleset names have been kept for compatibility/history-keeping reasons.
