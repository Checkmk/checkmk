As of version 2.3, the uptime monitoring service for Docker containers could crash if the container's start time was later than the current CheckMk site's current time. This resulted in a negative uptime calculation error (ValueError: "Cannot render negative timespan").
This could occur in situations where the host system and the container had different configured timezones.

We now correctly handle all timestamps, ensuring accurate uptime calculations regardless of timezone configurations.
