Werk 13498 introduced the possibility to set limit publish permissions
to certain contact groups, sites etc. Still, the permission "Publish views"
(e.g. for publishing views) was needed to see the published views. With 
Werk 16320 this has been fixed for dashboards, views and reports.

This werk fixes the behavior for the remaining components (Bookmarks, Graphs,
SLAs and Reports).

Note: Please check the respective publish configuration.
