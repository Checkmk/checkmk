Title: Remove websphere_mq plugin
Class: security
Compatible: incomp
Component: checks
Date: 1710155388
Edition: cre
Level: 1
Version: 2.2.0p26

With this Werk the <code>websphere_mq</code> plugin is removed for security reasons.

In this plugin the output of <code>ps</code> is used to determine an argument for
<code>runmqsc</code>. This meant that anybody who can launch processes with an arbitrary
command line could manipulate one argument to <code>runmqsc</code>.

The plugin was already superseded by the agent plugin <code>ibm_mq</code> and deprecated with Werk <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/10752">10752</a> and version 2.0.0.

Since this plugin is already deprecated and it was not configurable via the
<em>agent bakery</em> we assumed that this plugin is not frequently used. Therefore we
decided to not fix the issue but to push the removal.

We found this vulnerability internally.
