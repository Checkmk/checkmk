With this Werk the `websphere_mq` plugin is removed for security reasons.

In this plugin the output of `ps` is used to determine an argument for
`runmqsc`. This meant that anybody who can launch processes with an arbitrary
command line could manipulate one argument to `runmqsc`.

The plugin was already superseded by the agent plugin `ibm_mq` and deprecated with Werk [10752](https://checkmk.com/werk/10752) and version 2.0.0.

Since this plugin is already deprecated and it was not configurable via the
*agent bakery* we assumed that this plugin is not frequently used. Therefore we
decided to not fix the issue but to push the removal.

We found this vulnerability internally.

__Affected versions__:

* 2.3.0
* 2.2.0
* 2.1.0
* 2.0.0

Migrate to the `ibm_mq` plugin.
