By default a GUI session is terminated after 90 minutes of inactivity (Configurable via global setting **Session management**).
A user could therefore start a session and e.g. start configuring a complex check and while doing something other (e.g. researching some options) the site could be updated.
If the user does not interact with the site in that period the user won't notice that the site was updated.
Since updates might change some behaviour the session might not work as intended.

Therefore during an update all sessions are now terminated.
This will cause users to re-authenticate after a site update.
