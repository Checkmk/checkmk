Rulespec/ruleset names now have to be valid [python identifiers](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers) that are not [reserved keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords). This also applies to choice identifiers in FormSpecs.

The validation occurs during instantiation and will raise a `ValueError` when a violation is found.
