Previously a regex was applied for the Checkmk versions -> #Sites inventory column to filter on the number of sites.
This has been changed to instead filter a range of numbers to better match the column type. For example a previous filter of `[0-9]|10` now translates to an explicit range from `0` to `10`.
If you currently have any filters for the number of sites configured, you need to reconfigure them.
