Before this update, configuring 'Volume parameters' in the PVC check plugin led to a crash. This
issue arose because the plugin was not designed to process trend size-related levels, which, 
however, were anticipated by the general filesystem function handler shared among filesystem-related
check plugins. To resolve this, the general function has been modified to bypass trend computation
when a trend rule is not set, a scenario always applicable to the PVC check plugin.
