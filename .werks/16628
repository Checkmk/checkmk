Title: Enforcing password change redirect with 2FA enabled

Before this werk, the site failed to redirect users to the
"Change Password" page following a successful login when
two-factor authentication (2FA) was enabled. This werk resolves
the issue by ensuring that, after completing 2FA, users are now
redirected correctly.
