The active check "check_mailboxes" could fail with a <code>KeyError: 'folders'</code> when trying to retrieve an exchange mailbox's folders via the EWS protocol.

With this werk the used library <code>exchangelib</code> is updated to v5.4.0, which prevents the underlying issue in retrieving certain exchange folders.
