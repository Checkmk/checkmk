The dashboard element "Average scatterplot" was rendered topmost at all times after being hovered once. This resulted in other dashboard elements' tooltips to be rendered behind the "Average scatterplot" element.

This behavior is fixed. After hovering the "Average scatterplot", i.e. when moving the mouse outside of its graph area, its topmost rendering is reset, making other tooltips visible again.
