On folder setup pages the page menu entries "Run bulk service discovery", "Rename multiple hosts" and "Detect network parent hosts" (in page menu "Hosts" > "In this folder") were unclickable if there was no host given in the current folder, even if subfolders held hosts.
This bug is fixed to the former behavior, enabling the three actions whenever the current folder or any of its subfolders holds at least one host.
