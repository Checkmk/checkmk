The page menu entry "Hosts" > "In this folder" > "Run bulk service discovery" on folder setup pages was unclickable if there was no host given in the current folder, even if subfolders held hosts.
This bug is fixed to the former behavior, enabling the bulk service discovery whenever the current folder or any of its subfolders holds at least one host.
