Multiple matching rules of the bakery configuration ruleset "TSM - IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (Linux, Unix)" will now be merged to compute the set of effective parameters.
Previously only the first matching rule was applied.

During the migration to Checkmk 2.4 existing rules will be "filled", such that the outcome of the rule evaluation will not change on existing configurations.
