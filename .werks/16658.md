This werk adds the `mode` query parameter to the delete endpoint for host tag
groups. It is an alternative to the existing `repair` parameter, with the
following options:

* `mode=abort` default behaviour, cancel deletion if tag group is in use
* `mode=delete` same as `repair=True`, will delete affected rules
* `mode=remove` will remove the tag group condition from rules instead of
deleting the entire rule
