Some query parameters (like livestatus queries) are supposed to be JSON encoded.
Previously, swagger (the interactive REST API GUI) would encode these queries
differently, leading to unexpected errors. Our OpenAPI spec was updated to fix
this issue.

Other clients are not affected, unless they were generated using our OpenAPI
spec.
