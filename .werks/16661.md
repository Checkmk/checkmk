Previously mknotifyd only supported IPv4. This werk adds support for IPv6.

Incoming connections now accept IPv4 and IPv6 if the server supports dual-stack
IPv6. For outgoing connections you may now enter IPv6 addresses as well. IPv6
will also be used, if a hostname resolves to an IPv6 address. If a hostname
resolves to both IPv4 and IPv6, IPv4 is still preferred.
