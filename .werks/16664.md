The inventory data of `inv_cisco_vlans` and `inv_if` used to be combined in one row.

This behavior was broken as of 2.3, where two different rows were displayed for each 
inventory plugin.

Now the rows are unified again.

Also fixed the missing color of the status displayed in the inventory rows.
