For clustered services, the nodes' autocheck files would be written with the
aggregated clustered service information. This is incorrect because individual
nodes should have their own service information.

This could cause the non-clustered services to be overridden when a clustered
service being discovered. And discovering a non-clustered services could also
override the clustered services.

This is now fixed and the individual node information is written to the
autochecks file.

This means that when applying changes to clustered services, non-clustered
services will no longer be affected and vice versa.

As part of this effort, the aggregation for service labels on clusters has also
been fixed. This means that instead of using the labels of the first node, the
aggregated labels of all nodes are being used.
