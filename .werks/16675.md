This change is only relevant for plugin developers.

Some rule specs allow the configuration of the `eval_type` to specify how the rules are meant to be evaluated in respect to each other.
However, this configuration is not considered in some cases, instead Checkmk uses a predetermined evaluation type.
For the affected rule specs this option was removed:

* AgentConfig
* NotificationParameters
* DiscoveryParameters
