The active check "http" allows different configurations for the address family in the host settings, among others the primary address family.
If this option is selected, a primary IP address now has to be configured for the relevant host.
An IP address also has to be configured for the host if no explicit address is configured in the rule.


Note that this active check is being deprecated in favor of the newer "httpv2".
