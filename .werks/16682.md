This change is relevant to plugin developers

The migration helper functions `migrate_to_integer_simple_levels` and `migrate_to_float_simple_levels` for `SimpleLevels` currently apply the scaling factor (if given) every time the migration is run, meaning also to the already migrated value.
This means any rule where these helpers are used with a scaling factor will have incorrect values and will have to be manually corrected.

No shipped rules are affected by this.
