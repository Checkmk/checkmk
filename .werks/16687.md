This only affects plugin developers using the new API in `cmk.server_side_calls`.
The config generation for custom plugins crashed when passwords where in cluded in the command.

The mechanism how to pass `Secret`s has changed since 2.3.0b3.
To learn how to adjust your special agent or active check to the new API, please refer to the Sphinx documentation of the `cmk.server_side_calls.v1.Secret` object.
