If a notification process was terminated because of a timeout, in the failed
notifications view only "HOST/SERVICE NOTIFICATION RESULT" was shown without
further informations.

We now show the current delivery attempt and the timeout in seconds.
You will find this message also in the notify.log next to the spoolfile name.
