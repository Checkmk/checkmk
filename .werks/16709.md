If you used the option "Send out notification according to notification rules
(uncheck to avoid spam)" in "Test notifications" for other notification methods
than "HTML Email" or "ASCII Email", the processed notification script could
crash with a Traceback.

This is caused by missing notification parameters that differ for each
notification method.

We now limit the mentioned option to HTML and ASCII Email, as originally
intended.

Testing all other notification methods is still possible, but you can only send
out HTML and ASCII notifications.
