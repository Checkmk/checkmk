Werk #16707 added useful log information to failed notifications in case of a timeout.
In some cases, this log contained also script output.

We now show the timeout message within "Summary" of the notification result
and, if available, the last output of the notification plugin followed by the
timeout message within the "Comment" column. Both are separated by "--".
