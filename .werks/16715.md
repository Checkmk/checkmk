In order to improvide the Rest API, adjustments have been made to the
data types returned in the `comments` and `downtimes` endpoints as
specified below:

* `Show a comment` and `Show comments` endpoints:
`entry_time` now shows the date stamp in ISO 8601 format.

Before: "Jun 03 2024 06:05:41"
Now: "2024-03-06T06:05:41+00:00"

* `Show downtime` and `Show all schedulled downtimes`.
`recurring` and `is_service` fields now are boolean types.

Before:
`recurring`: "yes"
`is_service`: "no"

Now:
`recurring`: true
`is_service`: false
