This change is incompatible for plugin developers that used the `HostAddress` validator in the `cmk.rulesets.v1` API of Checkmk 2.4.
From the Checkmk Exchange we have no evidence of that being the case.

This element was added to the public API mistakenly, and we decided to remove it.

If you used this element in one of your plugins, this plugin will only work in Checkmk versions 2.4.0b1 to 2.4.0p10. To fix this, you can simply copy the code into your plugin.

We're really sorry about this glitch, since this was the one thing that wasn't supposed to happen for a versioned API. We are adding some technical measures to avoid this happening again.
