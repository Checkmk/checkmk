The error message for warnings of type FutureWarning now includes the specific regex that triggered the warning, which was previously missing.

This enhancement provides users with more detailed information, making it easier to identify and address deprecated or problematic configurations early. As a result, users can improve system reliability by resolving issues before they cause failures.

No configuration changes are required; this update is purely informational.
