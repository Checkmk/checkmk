Some rulesets like 'Assignment of hosts (or services) to contact groups' use
contact groups which may not be synced because they are assigned to a specific
customer or to 'Provider' (default). This inconsistency might have already been
present in your configuration but went unnoticed in the previous versions. With
2.3, we introduced new validation mechanics which now warn you about this
potential issue.

With this change we make the shown error message a more helpful so that users
get a hint how to solve the situation.
