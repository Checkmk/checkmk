The existing entity sensor check plug-in discovers temperature, fan and binary
power sensors. The Arista check plug-in only covered temperature sensors and
used the common ENTITY-MIB.

Please run a re-discovery on the affected Arista devices. If there are rules
configured for the Arista temperature sensor services then these might have to
be adapted because the Arista check plug-in used the entPhysicalDescr entries
for the service items and the entity sensor check plug-in uses the
entPhysicalName entries.
