Title: mem_win: rename 'Commit Charge' to 'Virtual Memory' for correctness

The value previously displayed as 'Commit Charge' did not match its
description. Therefore, this value has been accurately renamed to
'Virtual Memory,' while maintaining the original calculation method.
Correspondingly, the titles of related graphs have been adjusted to
reflect this change.

In versions prior to 2.3, the service summary included a metric labeled
'Pagefile installed.' This has now been correctly renamed to
'Total Virtual Memory,' as it never accurately represented the
'Pagefile installed.'
