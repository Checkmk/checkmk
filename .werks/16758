Title: host_config: validate datatype for host attribute properly

Prior to this werk, the datatype was not properly validated allowing
wrong values to be specified for host attributes. For instance, the
parent attribute allowed a string instead of a list of strings which
subsequently led to an internal error. This werk fixes this issue.
