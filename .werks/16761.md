This change impacts all those who are monitoring Azure systems.

Azure resource group names aren't case sensitive.
The APIs may return values with different casing than the originally specified name.
(see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/frequently-asked-questions#are-resource-group-names-case-sensitive)

We modified the Azure agent in order to convert resources groups to lower case as soon as they are retrieved from the api.

This is an incompatible change so a rediscovery is needed for the services to be properly monitored.
