During the creation of certain rules with MultipleChoice formspec,
the following warning appeared due to default values being saved as a list instead of a tuple:
_"Unable to read current options of this rule. Falling back to default values. When saving this rule now, your previous settings will be overwritten. The problem was: [...]: The datatype must be list, but is tuple."_

This werk corrects this behavior by allowing the use of any `Sequence` of strings as values.
