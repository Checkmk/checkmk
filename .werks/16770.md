This werk impacts all those who monitor the disk usage of qtrees
via the check plugin _NetApp Filer: Used Space of qtrees in Volumes_

The qtree quota users information coming from the netapp API
was not being retrieved and parsed correctly by the special agent
and this was resulting in a crash during discovery.

This werk corrects this behaviour.
