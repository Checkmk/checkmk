Title: brocade_fcport: fix operating speed conversion

This werk affects anyone monitoring Brocade fibre channel ports
by comparing current or average throughput to certain absolute or percentage levels
via the <em>Brocade FibreChannel ports</em> rule.

In the plugin the current operating speed of the interface,
read from the SNMP interface data,
was not properly converted to GByte/s,
the unit of measurement displayed in the interface.
This resulted in an erroneous comparison of values and the related service states.
