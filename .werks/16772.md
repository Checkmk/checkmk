This werk affects anyone monitoring Brocade fibre channel ports
by comparing current or average throughput to certain absolute or percentage levels
via the _Brocade FibreChannel ports_ rule.

In the plugin the current operating speed of the interface,
read from the SNMP interface data,
was not properly converted to GByte/s,
the unit of measurement displayed in the interface.
This resulted in an erroneous comparison of values and the related service states.
