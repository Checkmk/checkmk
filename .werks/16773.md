This werk impacts who monitors Nutanix Prism Clusters.

Previously, the connection to the Nutanix Prism endpoint
was only possible by excluding the SSL certificate check.
This was because the agent used the endpoint's IP address instead of its hostname,
preventing certificate verification.

Now the agent validates the certificate by comparing the common name with the host name as known to Checkmk.
