This werk impacts those who monitor Nutanix Prism Clusters.

The agent was not correctly connecting to the Nutanix Prism endpoint
because it used the IP address of the endpoint instead of its hostname,
which prevented certificate verification.

Now, the agent validates the certificate by comparing the name in the certificate
with the hostname known to Checkmk.
Alternatively, it correctly avoids certificate verification if the relevant flag is active.
