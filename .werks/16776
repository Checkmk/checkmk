Title: chrony: change default warning level
Class: fix
Compatible: incomp
Component: checks

Version: 2.2.0p33

Chrony's default <code>minpoll</code> and <code>maxpoll</code> values are 64 seconds and 1024 seconds.
In standard situations (good internet connection, low error etc)
the interval between polls should stick near the max value (1024 seconds).
(see <code>https://chrony-project.org/examples.html#_client_using_public_servers</code>)

Beacuse of that, the default WARN alert is now set to 1025 seconds.
