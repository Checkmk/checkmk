Chrony's default `minpoll` and `maxpoll` values are 64 seconds and 1024 seconds.
In standard situations (good internet connection, low error etc)
the interval between polls should stick near the max value (1024 seconds).
(see `https://chrony-project.org/examples.html#_client_using_public_servers`)

Beacuse of that, the default WARN alert is now set to 1025 seconds.
