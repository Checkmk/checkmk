When configuring a notification rule with one of the following plugins

* Cisco Webex Teams
* iLert
* MS Teams
* PagerDuty
* Splunk On-Call
* SIGNL4 Alerting

the option to select a globally configured http proxy was not possible via
the REST-API. This werk addresses this issue and you can now select a globally
configured http proxy for any of the mentioned plugins.
