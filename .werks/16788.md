When creating a notification rule via the REST-API with the plugin
'asciimail', and configuring the 'enable_sync_smtp field', you could
previously set the subfield 'encryption' to any string.  Any string
is not a valid encryption type.

This werk addresses this issue by having this field be an enum of two
values which are "ssl_tls" or "starttls". This aligns with the options
found in the UI for the same plugin.
