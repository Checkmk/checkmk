If not configured otherwise, the service description of the active check "http" will be prepended with either "HTTP" or "HTTPS".
In older installations only the "HTTP" prefix was possible and special handling was introduced to keep the old prefix for existing services.

To improve the handling existing configurations of the "Service name" in the "Check HTTP service (deprecated)" rule may now be updated to contain the prefix "^HTTP" if the configured value does not start with a "^".
This only changes the saved rule, the actual description of the service will not change.
