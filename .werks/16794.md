This only affects you if you are configuring rules through the REST API.
In order to make the "checkgroup_parameters:if" ruleset compliant with the new Ruleset API, it has been renamed to "checkgroup_parameters:interfaces".
Any configuration inside Checkmk will be automatically updated, however any outside references to the old name will have to be adjusted manually.
