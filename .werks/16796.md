When updating to an edition with mandatory licensing (CCE and CME), we want to give users enough time to apply the license when updating.

A CME updated to 2.3 will now start in 30-day trial period instead of directly entering the "free" license state if it otherwise would not be licensed.
However, in a distributed setup it is recommended to make use of the change in [werk #16193](https://checkmk.com/werk/16193) to apply the license before the update.
