When running the SNMP connection tests for a host that has SNMPv3 credentials configured, the SNMPv1
and SNMPv2 connection tests crashed. With the Inline SNMP backend, the corresponding error message
read "argument 2 must be str, not tuple". With the Classic backend, there was no error message at
all.
