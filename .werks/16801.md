When adding a scalar to a custom graph, it is possible that no value is available for this scalar.
For example, this is the case when adding the CRIT threshold of a metric for which no thresholds are
configured. In such cases, no graph was rendered. Instead, the Checkmk UI displayed the message
"Cannot calculate graph recipes" and showed a traceback.

This werk restores the correct behavior: No lines are rendered for unavailable scalars and they are
denoted with "n/a" in the graph legend.
