Custom graphs can contain elements whose host or service is non-existant. This happens for example
when a host is removed from the monitoring after one of its metrics has been added to a custom
graph. In such cases, no graph was rendered. Instead, the Checkmk UI displayed the message "Cannot
calculate graph recipes" and showed a traceback.

As of this werk, the UI instead renders no lines for such elements and denotes them with "n/a" in
the graph legend.
