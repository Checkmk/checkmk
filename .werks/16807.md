If users had disabled checks that have since been removed or are temporarily unavailable (due to disabled MKPs for instance), they would be prompted with a message like

```
WARNING: Invalid rule configuration detected (Ruleset: ignored_checks, Title: Disabled checks, Folder: ,
-| Rule nr: 1, Exception: ifoperstatus is not an allowed value)
```

These invalid values are ignored now.
They do no harm and they are dropped upon editing the rule.
