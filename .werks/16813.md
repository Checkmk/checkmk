This Werk changes the exact condition under which the Unix agents kill long running cached agent plugins.

Affected are the Checkmk agent plugins for Linux, AIX, Solaris, OpenWrt and FreeBSD.

### Previous behavior

Any agent plugin that ran for more that twice its caching interval _without generating output_ was killed by the agent. The agent checked for this every minute.

### New behavior

Any agent plugin running for more than twice its caching interval will be killed.
It is no longer relevant wether the plugin produces output during that time.
The killing is done from within the asynchronous process itself, eliminating any potential danger of inadvertently killing the wrong process.
