This change only affects plugin developers using the API `cmk.agent_based.v2` in conjunction with static type checkers.

For section plugins the type annotations for host label functions where wrong and incomplete.
The order of the arguments was swapped and the overload allowing to implement host label functions with parameter merge type "ALL" was missing, resulting in flase positives in the linters report.
