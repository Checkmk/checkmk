In this werk, we replace the `cmk --scan-parents` command line tool with
a more flexible parent scan REST API endpoint.

As opposed to the command line option, the new endpoint will no longer
create automatically-applied `parents.mk` config files but rely on the
standard WATO configuration mechanism, so changes need to be activated
afterwards.

**Attention: Incompatibility, possible data loss in distributed
monitoring setups**

If you have previously used the parent scan through the command line
tool, the resulting `parents.mk` config files will be migrated into your
hosts configuration during the update process. However, **only parent
scan configurations on the central site will be migrated**, remote
site `parents.mk` configuration files will just be ignored. If this
affects your setup, please re-trigger a parent scan for the affected
child hosts in the GUI or REST API.
