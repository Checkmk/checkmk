Prior to this werk, Two Factor Authentication failures could not trigger account lockout. All three methods will now count towards failed login attempts against a user's account.
As a result, an attacker could try to brute-force and therefore bypass user's two factor protections without triggering the lockout mechanism.

This vulnerability was identified in a commissioned penetration test conducted by PS Positive Security GmbH.
