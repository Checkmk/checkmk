Prior to this werk, Two Factor Authentication could not be defined as requirement for Checkmk users. Users with permissions to make changes to _Global Settings_ or _Roles & Permissions_ can now either define all users within the Checkmk site or each user with a specified role must enable Two Factor Authentication.

Enforcing Two Factor based on a user's roles can be enabled via _(Setup > Users > Roles & permissions > Edit role)_.

Enforcing Two Factor for all users can be enabled via _(Setup > General > Global settings > User management > Enforce two factor authentication)_.

Enabling Two Factor for all users will override any role based Two Factor Authentication configurations.
