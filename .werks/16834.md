Previously, the Windows agent service deleted internal users 
created to execute plugins in group mode. As a result, the 
permission list for certain files may look strange over time, 
filled with UUIDs of non-existent users.

With this release, the problem has been resolved. The agent 
will create or reuse an existing user and will not delete it
