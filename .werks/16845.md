This Werk fixes a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Checkmk Windows 
Agent.

Prior to this Werk, it was possible for authenticated users on the monitored 
Windows host to execute commands as administrator account that is used to run 
the Agent, allowing them to elevate their privileges.
The reason for this issue were excessive write permissions on the 
`ProgramData\checkmk\agent` directory.

Note that you must update Checkmk as well as the agent in order to apply this 
fix.

This issue was found in a commissioned penetration test conducted by modzero 
GmbH.

*Affected Versions*:

* 2.3.0
* 2.2.0
* 2.1.0

*Mitigations*:

If updating is not possible, you can manually remove write access for non-admin 
users on the `ProgramData\checkmk\agent` folder.
To do this, navigate to the folder's property settings and make sure to verify 
the special permissions and advanced permission settings in addition to the 
basic permission settings.
