Previously, device name was used as service description for physical disks.
Device names aren't persistent, which led to services starting to receive
metrics of another device if device names get switched. This could happen
after an update or a reboot.

Now, it's possible to configure WWN (World Wide Name) to be used as service
description in the `Disk IO discovery` rule, in `Physical disks` configuration.

Old `Physical disks` configurations will continue to use device name as service
description to preserve compatibility. For the new configurations using WWN
will be the default.
