Until now, Azure agent fetched metrics for each resource individually.
This resulted in many requests made to the Azure API.
After the changes in Azure API rate limits it started causing agent timeouts in
large environments.

Now, the Azure agent fetches metrics in bulk per resource type and region.
This way the number of requests is significantly reduced.
Since metrics are no longer fetched per resource, parallel execution is also
removed together with the <code>Force agent to run in single thread</code> option.
