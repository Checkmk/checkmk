Previously, the Azure agent would crash when monitoring vNet gateways which have peerings
from a different subscription.
The agent wouldn't report the crash and the consequence was that the affected vNet gateway
wasn't monitored.

Now, the agent will not monitor vNet gateways peerings from another subscription.
