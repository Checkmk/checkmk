Title: host_config: skip host parent validation on host return
Class: fix

Prior to this werk, the REST API always validated if a specified
host parent is an existing host. This validation behavior differs
to the mechanism of the UI where it is possible that a host has
non existing hosts as parent. This werk modifies the behaviour of the
REST API to skip the host existence validation when a host is returned.
