Displaying the version number on the login screen is generally regarded
as a security risk because it can enable attackers to identify potential
vulnerabilities associated with that specific version. Consequently, we
have changed the default setting to hide the version number. Users who wish
to view the version number can manually enable this option through the
Global Settings. It should be highlighted that users who have previously set 
this option to show the version will not be affected by this change.

To aid automated scanning we assign a CVSS score of 0.0 (None) (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N).
