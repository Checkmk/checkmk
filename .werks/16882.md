This werk affects all users of Checkmk Raw.
You might have perceived a severe performance degradation in Checkmk 2.3.0 and a lot of errors in
the NPCD log. This was due to missing RRD packages and thus expensive fall-back computations.

This werk fixes a performance issue in combination with potentially missing metric data, which can
result in gaps in the service graphs.
