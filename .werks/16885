Title: Crash: liebert_maintenance: ValueError("Cannot render negative timespan") when time is overdue

<code>liebert_maintenance</code> check would crash with <code>ValueError("Cannot render negative timespan")</code> if the
value for "Next maintenance" is in the past.
This change now renders positive and negative values differently (also only printing days) adding
<code>'overdue'</code> if date for next maintenance is located in the past.
