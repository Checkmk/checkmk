Title: mk_job: MK_VARDIR defaults not being set in bakery
Class: fix
Compatible: compat

Due to a different way to set in <code>MK_VARDIR</code> in <code>mk_job</code>, default values
would not be baked into <code>mk_job</code> and derivates.
This change adds a replacement rule for the way <code>MK_VARDIR</code> gets assigned in
<code>mk_job</code> and also separates assignment and export in order to avoid known problems
with Solaris.
