Title: mssql_availability_groups: Parsing of section failed

Provided with invalid lines `parse_mssql_availability_groups()` would crash with an exception
```
IndexError: list index out of range
```
Resulting in `Parsing of section mssql_availability_groups` error message in UI.

This change makes `parse_mssql_availability_groups()` resilient to those lines by just
ignoring them.
