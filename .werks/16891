Title: check_ewon: TypeError ('NoneType' object is not subscriptable) raised if values for levels are missing
Class: fix

In case values for `levels` are missing and `None` taken instead, running the check function would
crash with `TypeError ('NoneType' object is not subscriptable)`.

This change hard codes some default values in case no values could be extracted.
