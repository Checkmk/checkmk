Title: chrony: wrong handling of 'n/a' values for 'Ref time (UTC)' and 'Stratum'

A chrony status without a valid server also contains invalid values for 'Stratum' and 'Ref time',
resulting in a 'Time since last sync' of 54 years 256 days being reported (which is the difference
to epoc := 1.1.1970).

This change just skips reporting 'Stratum' and 'Time since last sync' if we don't have a valid
server (address).
