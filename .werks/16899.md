Setting levels for oracle_locks to (0, 0) or not setting any levels at all makes the check plugin
either compare with 0 or with default levels, making it impossible to avoid WARN or CRIT results
without fully disabling the check.

This change skips checking against levels if both warn and crit levels have been set to 0, thus
keeping the behavior for default levels.
