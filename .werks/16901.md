Having an 'Integrate Nagios plug-ins' rule configured to call 'check_ping' but having the actual
value for 'Command line' not start with 'check_ping' or './check_ping' wouldn't have it recognized
correctly resulting in ms wrongly interpreted as seconds.
This change also allows the command to contain '/check_ping' in order to recognize more ways
to write the custom command and thus displaying correct units.
