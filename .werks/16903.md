Due to TLS requirements `agent_proxmox_ve` used the configured host name only for connection, which
is problematic in environments without DNS capabilities.
This change tackles this by allowing to (optionally) specify to use the (already resolved) IP
address, a custom (macro enabled) string value or explicit use of the host name instead.
