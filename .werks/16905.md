A redundant mechanism enforcing unique service item names added the (frequently changing)
OID index to the item name, even if device description strings were already unique.
This change removes one of those measures, alowing the item name to be the device description
only if that is unique already.
Please note, while already discovered services should still return valid states, service
names might (very likely) change on re-discovery. E.g. a service formerly named
"Power Supply 1234" would now be called "Power Supply" only, if that name is unique among
all discovered `cisco_power` services.
