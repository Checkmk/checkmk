Pre-compilation for Python byte code had previously been done during package
builds, resulting in bigger Checkmk installation packages and potentially
missing precompiled files due to differences in packaging processes.

This change turns the different `compileall` call sites into one post-install
step for both `.deb` and `.rpm` packages, handling the whole Checkmk package
at once.

As a result the whole Checkmk installation process takes roughly 10sec longer.
