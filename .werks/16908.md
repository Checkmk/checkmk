Starting with Checkmk v2.5.0, Python 2 support (see [werk 12149](https://checkmk.com/werk/12149))
is dropped and only Python 3.4+ is supported for agent plugins.

Since Checkmk doesn't have a 'version barrier' for agent (or agent plugin) communication implemented or
planned, you have options in case you still need to run agents or agent plugins in a Python2-only environment:
- you can just keep the old agent + plugins installed (or provide them using
  installers of older versions of Checkmk)
- download a [Checkmk package with Python 2 support still enabled](https://checkmk.com/download/archive)
  and install one of the contained agent installers, e.g.:
  ```
  wget https://download.checkmk.com/checkmk/2.4.0p17/check-mk-raw-2.4.0p17_0.noble_amd64.deb
  dpkg-deb -R check-mk-raw-2.4.0p17_0.noble_amd64.deb extracted
  ls extracted/opt/omd/versions/*/share/check_mk/agents/*.deb
  dpkg -i extracted/opt/omd/versions/2.4.0p17.cre/share/check_mk/agents/check-mk-agent_2.4.0p17-1_all.deb
  ```
- bring your own plugin: plugins from external sources (or home grown plugins)
  are not affected (they're only not included or maintained anymore)
