In most cases, the perfometer of file system services shows the used space in percent. However,
before this werk, in rare cases, this perfometer displayed multiple segments. In particular, this
was the case for file systems with provisioning or overcommittment. In such cases, the
interpretation of the perfometer was unclear. Therefore, as of this werk, the perfometer always
displays the used space in percent.

Furthermore, the displayed value now takes reserved space into account. Before, reserved space was
ignored when computing the usage displayed by the perfometer.
