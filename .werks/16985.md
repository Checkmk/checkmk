Prior to this werk, all vertical graph ranges were interpreted as minimal ranges. A minimal graph
range specificies a range of values that is always covered, regardless of the displayed data. In
case the latter falls outside the minimal range, the actual graph range is automatically extended
accordingly.

While this interpretation is correct for graphs specified via the new [new API](https://checkmk.com/werk/16259),
it is incorrect for other graph types such as custom graphs with a fixed range or graphs specified
via the [legacy API](https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/devel_check_plugins.html?lquery=perf-o-meter#new_metricdefinition)
(`range` key).
