When rendering a graph with a vertical range that does not comprise all the data, the lower vertical
range limit was not respected. Instead, the rendered lines or areas extended into the area below the
graph, potentially covering the time axis labels.

As of this werk, rendered lines and areas are cut off at the lower vertical range limit.
