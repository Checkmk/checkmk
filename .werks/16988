For certain Proxmox VMs, the service <i>Proxmox VE VM Backup Status</i> might have incorrectly
alerted about missing backups. This was caused by a limitation in the Proxmox agent regarding the
processing of logs and tasks. Specifically, log files larger than 5,000 lines were truncated.

A possible indicator that monitored VMs are affected by this issue is the presence of files named
<tt>erroneous-...</tt> in <tt>tmp/check_mk/special_agents/agent_proxmox_ve</tt>. Especially if these
files end with messages such as "Log for VMID=... not finalized", at least some VMs are likely
affected. To immediately benefit from this werk, users should delete the folder
<tt>tmp/check_mk/special_agents/agent_proxmox_ve</tt>. Otherwise, it can take up the maximum log
age for this werk come into effect after updating Checkmk (the maximum log age is configured in
the Proxmox agent rule).
