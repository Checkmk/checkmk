Title: Windows agent: new option "file" for writing output into a file
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: feature

The redirection of the output of the agent via <tt>check_mk_agent test &gt; filename</tt>
does not work correctly on Windows and misses some of the outputs of check plugins.
Therefore if you want to get the output into a file the simply call the agent as follows:

C+:
C:\Program Files\Check_MK\> check_mk_agent file output.txt
C-:

The output will then be written to the file <tt>output.txt</tt>.
