Introduce a new global setting, called 'Default dynamic visuals permission',
which can be used to change the default permission for all roles
(including built-in roles) of dynamic visuals such as custom dashboards, views,
etc.

If set to 'yes' all roles will have the permission to access these visuals by
default. If set to 'no' only the admin role will be able to access the dynamic
visuals.
