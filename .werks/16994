When disabling an active or custom check and running the service discovery via
the REST-API, for example with the

C+:
/domain-types/service_discovery_run/actions/start/invoke
C-:

endpoint, this would cause an error 500 to be returned.

Now, the service discovery via the REST-API works as expected.
