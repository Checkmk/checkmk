Title: local: New state type P for state computation based on perfdata
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1386165155
Class: feature

The section <tt>&lt;&lt;&lt;local&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt> now allows a new state
marker <tt>P</tt> (next to <tt>0</tt>, <tt>1</tt>, <tt>2</tt> and <tt>3</tt>).
When setting this marker, the check plugin computes the state according to the
levels contained in the performance data. Take the following example:

F+:
<<<local>>>
P Environment temp=30;28;35|humidity=33;40:60;35:70;0;100 This is a text
F-:

The check will first check the variable <tt>temp</tt>. It's current value
is <tt>30</tt>. The levels are at <tt>28</tt> and <tt>35</tt> for warning and
critical, resp. Because 30 is greater then 28 this will trigger a warning.

The second performance value <tt>humidity</tt> has both lower and upper
levels for warning and critical - separated by a colon. The
current value is 33, which is lower than the lower critical level
of <tt>35</tt>. This will make this variable und thus the total check critical.

H2:Notes

<ul>
<li>It is allowed to use fractional values like <tt>35.12</tt>.</li>
<li>If the current value exactly matches a level, the <i>better</i> state is being used. This
is not consistent with the usual levels in Check_MK checks, but is neccessary if you want
to have just one single value to be OK.</li>
<li>When using <tt>P</tt> then the current values of all variables are appended to the plugin output.
If you want you can omit the your additional text at all in that case.</li>
<li>When you use <tt>P</tt> and do not supply performance data or do not supply levels, the
status will always be <b>OK</b>.</li>
</ul>

Example for a <tt>local</tt> line without a text:

F+:
<<<local>>>
P Environment temp=30;28;35|humidity=33;40:60;35:70;0;100
F-:

The output will be:

C+:
Environment          CRIT - temp 30.0 > 28.0(!), humidity 33.0 < 35.0(!!)
C-:
