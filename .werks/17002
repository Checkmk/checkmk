Microsoft is retiring the Azure resource "Database for MySQL single server" (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/migrate/whats-happening-to-mysql-single-server).

With this Werk we now support monitoring the recommended Azure resource "Database for MySQL flexible server".
In the rule "Microsoft Azure" under "Azure services to monitor" users can now select the new option "Database for MySQL flexible server".
(Note that the former option "Database for MySQL" was renamed to "Database for MySQL single server" and stays in place.)

The metrics monitored for flexible servers correspond to those monitored for single servers and the same checks are used.
