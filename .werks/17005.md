This werk enables users to filter the tags imported for AWS monitoring as Checkmk labels or to ignore all such tags.
A new option "Import tags as host labels" is available for both the AWS rule and the AWS quick setup. Users can choose to either import all valid tags or to filter valid tags by a regular expression pattern. To ignore AWS tags the option must be unchecked.

Tags are imported as Checkmk host labels in the format "cmk/aws/tag/{key}:{value}" for EC2 and ELB piggyback hosts.

This change does not affect earlier configurations of the AWS rule. Such configurations continue to import all valid tags.
