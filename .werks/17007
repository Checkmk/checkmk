Views such as "All hosts" were not sortable by columns "IP adresses" ("Host addresses (IPv4/IPv6)") and "IPv6 address" ("Host address (IPv6)").

With this werk views are now sortable by these two columns. By clicking the column header the table rows are sorted based on the respective table cell value.
