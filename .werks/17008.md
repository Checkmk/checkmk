Views, e.g. "All hosts", are rendered with a scrollbar in case their content exceeds the given browser space. Scrollbars are rendered overlaying the content, which could result in some invisible and/or unclickable view content.

A views content is now given enough padding to the right and the bottom so the scrollbars do not block content anymore once users scroll the given content to the end.
