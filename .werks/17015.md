Due to some format changes on the host tags, the rule notification
REST-API endpoints have also been affected. This werk takes these changes
into account. To do this, the possible enum values for a tag group has
been modified.

The match_host_tags field takes accepts a list of aux_tags or tag_groups.
For tag groups, we now accept two new operators.

Previously, the enum looked like

enum=["is", "is_not"]

and now it looks like

enum=["is", "is_not", "one_of", "none_of"]


In addition, when the operator field is one of the new values, we expect
a list of tag_ids and not a single tag_id.

Tag group using one of the previous enum values (no change here)

'''
{
    "operator": "is"
    "tag_id": "tagid"
}
'''

Tag group using one of the new new enum values

'''
{
    "operator": "one_of",
    "tag_ids": ["tagid_1", "tagid2", "tagid3"],
}
'''
