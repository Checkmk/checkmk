When configuring a notification rule using the Opsgenie_issues plugin,
you can now configure "extra_properties". This new configurable
option is available in both the UI and the REST-API. Extra properties
that you can configure, include

* Site ID
* Tags of the host
* IP address of the host
* Absolute time of the alert
* Relative time of the alert
* Additional plug-in output
* Acknowledgement author
* Acknowledgement comment
* Metrics
* Custom host/service notes URL
* Complete variable list


We now also allow for macros with the Tags in the Opsgenie_issues plugin.
