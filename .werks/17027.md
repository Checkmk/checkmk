The new Certificate Overview page is now available under `Setup > Maintenance > Certificate Overview`.

This page provides a comprehensive overview of the certificates Checkmk uses internally, including their storage location, key length, expiration date, and other properties.

Note that Trusted CA settings remain separate and are still managed in the *Global Settings*.
