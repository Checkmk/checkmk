Fixed a parsing issue in the huawei_osn_laser check plugin.
The problem appeared every time a serivce was supposed to have an OK state and caused the check plugin to crash, and thus not deliver any result.
The crash report ended with this line:
C+:
if "\n" in subresult[1]:
C-:
This has now been fixed.
