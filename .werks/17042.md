Even though there were 'disabled' units with 'failed' status, the check state did not reflect this, but remained OK.
This has now been changed. The new default behaviour is that if any unit is in 'failed' status, the check state will be CRIT.
The new behaviour can be overridden by configuring the appropriate rule.
