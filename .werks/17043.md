This affects users who have configured the 'Levels on the time left until a critical temperature (upper or lower) is reached' parameter.

Currently, if the temperature was above the set upper critical level or below the set lower critical level, the check crashed with an error similar to:

```
File "/omd/sites/vls/lib/python3.12/site-packages/cmk/agent_based/v1/render.py", line 76, in _gen_timespan_chunks
    raise ValueError("Cannot render negative timespan")
```

This is now fixed. With the new behaviour, if the critical levels have already been reached, it will be represented in the summary.
