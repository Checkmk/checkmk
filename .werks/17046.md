Xen Dom0 hosts should not be classified as virtual machines.
With this werk, the label 'cmk/device_type:vm' is no longer created for this type of host.
Detection now follows official Xen Project criteria for identifying Dom0 vs DomU systems. For reference, see: https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Xen_FAQ_Dom0#How_do_I_tell_if_I.27m_running_in_a_dom0_or_a_domU.3F
To benefit from this change, the Checkmk Agent needs to be redeployed.
