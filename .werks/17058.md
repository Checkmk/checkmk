Werk #16219 limited the length of hostnames to a maximum length of 253 characters.
Still, hostnames with a length greater 237 could lead to an error in the
service discovery like "[Errno 36] File name too long: ...".

This has been fixed and all service discovery background job directories will
be converted on update.
