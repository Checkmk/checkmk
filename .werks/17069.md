If the rebot command fails on a test node or if all attempts time out, no merged XML data is
available on the Checkmk server. In this case, the corresponding plan service will report the
standard message "Item not found in monitoring data" and go UNKNOWN. Before this werk, the test
services behaved in the same way. As of this werk, they instead go stale, which is the intended
behavior.
