On Linux systems, the agent controller always runs as the cmk-agent user, independently of the user
starting the controller. Hence, in import mode, the input file must readable by the cmk-agent user.
Otherwise, the import will fail. As of this werk, the controller displays a more informative error
message in this case, hinting at the point that the input file must be readable by cmk-agent.
