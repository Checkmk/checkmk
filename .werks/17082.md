As explained in werk [#17080](https://checkmk.com/werk/17080) the wrong conditions could lead to processes not releasing crucial file locks and the site subsequently freezing.
However, the werk did not address all the conditions.

With this werk, the cleanup of open resources was improved, which together with werk [#17081](https://checkmk.com/werk/17081) fixes another instance of processes not releasing their locks.
