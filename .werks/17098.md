Incorrectly assigned permissions allowed local, unprivileged Windows users to read sensitive data of the Checkmk Windows agent.

Before this Werk, non-admin users could read files in the `ProgramData\checkmk\agent` directory.
This directory contains sensitive information, such as the agent's private key used to authenticate its TLS connections to the Checkmk site.

The issue is a regression from an incomplete fix in Werk #16845. It was found during internal review.

*Affected Versions*:

* 2.3.0
* 2.2.0 >= 2.2.0p22
* 2.1.0 (EOL)

*Mitigations*:

If updating is not possible, you can manually remove all permissions for the group Users on the directory `ProgramData\checkmk\agent` and all its contents.

*Vulnerability Management*:
