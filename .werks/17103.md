Logging in via a SAML2 connection failed if the certificate configured for signing the SAML requests was also in the Checkmk CA trust store or in the global system trust store.

In this case, clicking the "Login with SAML connection" button failed with "Unable to create authentication request. Please contact your administrator".
A SignatureError for trying to sign the request XML with xmlsec1 was visible in the web.log.

This is now fixed.
