This fixes a regression in Checkmk version 2.3.
When using the setting _"Ping IP address identified by its index"_ of the plugin _ICMP Echo Request (Ping)_, the used address was off by one.

The fix is incompatible for users that have accounted for this error and changed their rule.

To avoid mistakes in the future, we've added a hint to the rule, and validate that the configured index is equal to or larger than 1.
