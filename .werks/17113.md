This werk integrates the popular Ceph plugin written by Robert Sander into Checkmk.

This adds the plugins

* Ceph Storage: Status
* Ceph Storage: Pools
* Ceph Storage: Classes
* Ceph Storage: OSD - BlueFS Slow Device
* Ceph Storage: OSD - BlueFS Database Device
* Ceph Storage: OSD - BlueFS Write-Ahead Log

Enterprise users can deploy the agent plugin using the bakery ruleset _"Ceph (Linux)"_.
It requires python and the third party python library 'rados' to be installed.

Users who previously used Robert Sanders MKP [Ceph statistics](https://exchange.checkmk.com/p/ceph) should upgrade it to the most recent version, which shall disable itself upon upgrade to Checkmk 2.4.
(This werk will be updated once the version is confirmed.)

The only change will be the renamed host labels, that all get the _"cmk/"_ prefix (_"ceph/osd"_ becomes "_cmk/ceph/osd"_ and _"ceph/mon"_ becomes _"cmk/ceph/mon"_).

Since it provides a more comprehensive monitoring of Ceph devices, it will replace the previous Ceph plugins

 * Ceph Storage: Health Status
 * Ceph Storage: OSDs
 * Ceph Storage: PGs
 * Ceph Storage: MGRs
 * Ceph Storage: Pools

These plugins will continue to work in Checkmk 2.4 as long as an agent is deployed using the old agent plugin.
New deployments however will contain the new plugin.
