If retention intervals are configured for remote trees then these trees are updated with new
timestamps for the relevant fields. The inventory updater gets the zipped inventory data and
archives the received trees if the timestamps of these trees themselves differ from the timestamps
of the current trees although there are no contentual differences. This leads to superflous archived
trees.
Now the zipped inventory data contain information whether the tree has to be archived or not.

Note: The central and remote site has to be at least of this version in order to make this work
properly.
