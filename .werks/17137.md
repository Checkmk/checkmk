This werk only affects users which have configured custom SQLs for `mk_oracle`.

The cache information of services which are generated from `oracle_sql` are not correct if there
are different max. cache ages configured. Now we handle such situations similar to `local` or
`mrpe` check plug-ins.

Please install the latest `mk_oracle` agent plug-in on the affected target hosts.
