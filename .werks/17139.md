Executables put in the plugin folder `cmk/plugins/<FAMILY>/libexec` sometimes where not found by
the plugin discovery mechanism.

More specificly, if the implementation of the corresponding server side calls plugin was put in a
subfolder of the well-known folder, eg. `<FAMILY>/server_side_calls/cce/check_norris.py`.
