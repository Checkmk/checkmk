As announced with Werk #16223 authentication via the `_username`/`_secret` parameters for automation users is disabled by default now.

It can be enabled via the configuration option *Enable automation user authentication via HTTP parameters*.
Please note that this option will be removed with Checkmk 2.5. We highly recommend to switch to Basic Authentication.
