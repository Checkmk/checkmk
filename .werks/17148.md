When using the special agent *VNX quotas and filesystems* or the active check *Check SFTP Service* the host keys were not properly checked.

If an attacker would get into a machine-in-the-middle position he could intercept the connection and retrieve information e.g. passwords.

As of this Werk the host key check is properly done.
In order to store known host keys a regular `known_hosts` file is used that is stored in `/omd/sites/$SITENAME/.ssh/known_hosts`.
If a host key changes an error is now raised that requires manual edit of this file.
