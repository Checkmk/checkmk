The rule search page offers two parameters "Host match list" and "Item
match list". These parameters could be used to search for rules which
have their explicit host or item condition set up in such a way that it
matches the given host or service (either by being unset or set).
However, these parameters do not check other conditions and might return
rules which for other reasons (such as a second host tag condition for
example) still might not match the specified host or service.

This werk renames these fields to "Explicit host matching" and "Explicit
item matching" and expands on their inline help to clarify this
behavior.

To see which rules are effective on a given host, please refer to the
"effective parameters" item under the burger menu in a host monitoring
view.
