Title: Microsoft Teams: Use workflows instead of connectors
Class: fix
Compatible: incomp
Component: notifications
Date: 1721050042
Edition: cre
Level: 1
Version: 2.2.0p32

Since Microsoft announced the deprecation of connectors, the notification
plugin for Microsoft Teams was adjusted to use workflows.

Deprecation note:
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-office-365-connectors-within-microsoft-teams/

To configure a workflow within Microsoft Teams:

* Click the 3 dots on a channel and select “Workflows”
* Choose "Post to a channel when a webhook request is received"
* Choose name for the workflow, e.g. "Checkmk"
* Select team and channel where the webhook should post to
* Copy webhook URL

For further informations please see section "How do I transition from Office
365 connectors to Workflows?" in the deprecation note.

To configure the notification plugin within Checkmk:

* Post copied webhook URL to "Webhook URL" of your notification rule for MS Teams

If you used custom "Details for host notifications" or "Details for service
notifications", the line break "&lt;br&gt;" has to be replaced by "\\u00A0\\n".

As we now use Adaptive Cards instead of Message Cards, we can no longer use
colors.
