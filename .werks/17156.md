You can now use an API (Jira Cloud) or Personal access token (Jira on premise)
to authenticate. This is availabe in the new "Authentication" section of the
notification rule for Jira. Please see the inline help for more informations.

As basic auth is deprecated for Jira Cloud, please update your notification
rule configuration.
