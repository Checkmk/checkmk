If you enabled "Send out HTML/ASCII email notification according to
notification rules" in the "Test notifications" section and a rule with a
plug-in other than "HTML Email" or "ASCII Email" matched, the notify.log showed
something like "notifying USERNAME via ...".

As you can only send out HTML Email and ASCII Email notifications, the log will
now show "would notify cmkadmin via ...".
