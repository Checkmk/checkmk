Changes were made to the notification format for Microsoft Teams to reduce
whitespace. No user action is required.

Formatting rules for the details:

* Supports Markdown, see [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/authoring-cards/text-features)
* Use `\n\n` for a new line
* An empty line will lead to a separator (`\n\n\n\n`)
