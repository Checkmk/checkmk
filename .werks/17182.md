Previously, only PROBLEM, RECOVERY and ACKNOWLEDGEMENT notifications were
supported by the Opsgenie plugin. Now the other types are also supported.
Flapping and Downtimes will add or remove tags from the alerts. Alert handler
executions will only add notes.

Due to how alerts are looked up in Opsgenie, the plugin will not be able to
update the alert if it is already closed. This means alert handler executions
that run after the recovery will not be able to add notes to the alert.

In order to enable these changes, the integration team name must be configured
in the plugin.
