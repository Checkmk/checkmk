Checkmk features to ways to disable services:
The rulesets _"Disabled Services"_ and _"Disabled Checks"_.

In case services had been disabled using the latter, and had never been discovered on a host, they were not shown to the user on the discovery page.
This is changed now.

As a result, users will now always see _all_ services that would be discovered, if they weren't disabled.
No matter which rule was used, and no matter whether they have been monitored in the past.
