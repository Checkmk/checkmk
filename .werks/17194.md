This only affects users that use the ancient `check_parameters` variable in custom '.mk' files to configure services.

This variable is not recognized anymore.
Affected users will see the message

`Cannot read in configuration file <file>: name 'check_parameters' is not defined`

during `cmk-update-config`.

This situation is detected before the actual update is started, leaving the site unchanged.

If you are affected, please remove all references to that variable from your '.mk' files.
Use the rulesets found in the _Setup_ menu _"Service monitoring rules"_ to configure check plugins.
