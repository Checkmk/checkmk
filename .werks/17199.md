Sometimes when creating a host user would experience a failing data source saying somehting like

_"pwstore: Password '\<some UUID\>' not found in \<file\>"_

This occurred for few special agents if users set up the corresponding rule before creating any host that would be matched by it.
As a workaround, users can just edit (open and save) the rule after the host is created.
