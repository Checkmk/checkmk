Depending on the setting of _"Checkmk agent / API integrations"_ in the _"Monitoring agents"_ section of the host settings, the host would run none, one or all of the configured special agents.

This is now simplified.
We always execute either all or none of the configured special agents.

The only setting where things change is _"API integrations if configured, else Checkmk agent"_.
If no special agents are configured the Checkmk agent will be used (as it was before).
If there are special agents configured, however, we now run _all_ of them.
Previously the alphabetically first special agent was chosen.
