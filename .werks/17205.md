This change affects users, which monitor NetApp via Ontap REST API. Previously,
the special agent could crash with the following error:
```
File "/omd/sites/nyccheckmk2/lib/python3/cmk/special_agents/agent_netapp_ontap.py", line 28, in write_section
  for element in generator:
File "/omd/sites/nyccheckmk2/lib/python3/cmk/special_agents/agent_netapp_ontap.py", line 471, in fetch_fans
  rpm=fan["rpm"],
~~^^^^^^^
KeyError: 'rpm'CRIT
```
This would occur, if either a fan or temperature sensor had an error, and thus
did not report any rpm/temperature value. This has been fixed.
