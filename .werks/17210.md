The agent plugin `smart` was rewritten to be compatible with POSIX, and is now
available under the new name `smart_posix`. In particular, the new plugin works
with FreeBSD. With this Werk, the new plugin `smart_posix` will be shipped by
the bakery. The new plugin requires `smartctl` version 7.2 or newer to be
installed. Thus, a user must update `smartctl` before deploying the new plugin
via the bakery.

The old plugin `smart` will continue to work as before, but it is only available
via older versions of Checkmk.
