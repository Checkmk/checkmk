The check plugin `dell_powerconnect_cpu` would crash with the following error:
```
  File "/omd/sites/test/share/check_mk/checks/dell_powerconnect_cpu", line 59, in check_dell_powerconnect_cpu
    ("util1", "%d%%" % saveint(oneminuteperc), params[0], params[1], 0, 100),
  KeyError (0)
```
The bug was introduced in the 2.3.0.
This Werk fixes the issue.
