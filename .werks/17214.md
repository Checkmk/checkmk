Previously, any site specific setting for `Automatic disk space cleanup` would
be ignored. Moreover, the command `omd diff` would report differences in the
file `etc/diskspace.conf`, even in a freshly created site. With this Werk, the
site specific settings are synchronized to a remote site upon activating
changes. Existing diskspace configurations will be migrated automatically. In
particular, the `omd diff` tool will no longer report changes to
`etc/diskspace.conf`.

Note, that the `etc/diskspace.conf` no longer affects the behaviour of the
diskspace cleanup tool.
