In Kubernetes 1.31, the feature `JobSuccessPolicy` has been enabled by default.
With this feature a new `JobCondition` is exposed via the API, which resulted in the following error:
```
Agent exited with code 1: 'Failuretarget' is not a valid JobConditionType
```
This error has been fixed. The new conditions `FailureTarget` and `SuccessCriteriaMet` are treated the same as the `Failure` and `Success` conditions respectively.
