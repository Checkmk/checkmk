If the `OMD_ROOT` was located on a filesystem, which started with a character
other than '/', then diskspace plugin would failwith the error:
```
File "/omd/sites/monitor/bin/diskspace", line 166, in _get_free_space
  if filesystem[0] == "/":
IndexError: string index out of range
```
This crash has been fixed. The call to `df -P -B1` was replaced with a direct
call to `os.statvfs`.
