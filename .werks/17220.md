This change affects the update process (either using `cmk-update-config` or `omd update`).
Sites may have configuration, MKPs and other local files, which are incompatible with the version targeted by omd update.
If such a problem occurs, then the user may be prompted for input.
In the past, if the user typed any input other than `c`, `continue`, `d`, `disable`, then the update would be aborted.
This would lead to an aborted update in case of simple typos such as `contnue`.
With this Werk, the update only accepts the following for input strings: `a`, `abort`, `c`, `continue`, `d`, `disable`.
If anything else is typed, then the user will be prompted repeatedly until some valid input is provided.
