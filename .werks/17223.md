This change affects customers, which are monitoring hosts on a remote site.
Previously, the HW/SW inventory would sporadically disappear on the central site, even though it was shown correctly on the remote site.
This was due to an incorrect implementation of the diskspace utility.
This implementation assumed that the inventory data was only needed on the remote site.
With this change, diskspace will only consider deleting the inventory data of hosts, which have been deleted.

The faulty behaviour was introduced in [#Werk 13422](https://checkmk.com/werk/13242).
A similar, but different issue, is addressed in [#Werk 17222](https://checkmk.com/werk/17222).
