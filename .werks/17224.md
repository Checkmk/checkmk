When a user selects `Setup > Maintainance > Site backup` and starts a backup, Checkmk will show the `IO` in bytes per second.
This `IO` was approximately off by the number of chunks processed in one second, thus was always too small.
Note, that the displayed quantity is (still) a moving average.
Thus, the `Size` is not exactly equal to `IO` times `Duration`.
