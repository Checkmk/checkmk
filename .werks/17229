Many CPU utilization checks can be configured to alert if the utilization is too high for too long
(configuration options <em>Levels over an extended time period on total CPU utilization</em> and <em>Levels
over an extended time period on a single core CPU utilization</em>).

Before, Checkmk alerted only if the utilization was above the threshold for too long. As of this
werk, Checkmk alerts if the utilization is above or exactly at the threshold for too long. This is
consistent with the general behavior of Checkmk to check against upper thresholds with a "greater
than or equal to" operation.
