The function <tt>get_counter()</tt> is now deprecated in the programming of
checks. There is a new function called <tt>get_rate()</tt> that should be
used as a replacement.

F+:
def get_rate(countername, this_time, this_val, allow_negative=False, onwrap=SKIP):
    ...
    return rate
F-:

The call syntax is almostthe same - just with the new optional parameter
<tt>onwrap</tt>.  Important however: now just the rate (counter steps
per second) is being returned. The formerly additional return value
<tt>timedif</tt> has been dropped since it is of no real use. So the return
type has changed from tuple to float.

The most imporant change - however - is in the handling of counter wraps. A
<i>counter wrap</i> happens in three situations:

<ul>
<li>When the counter is seen for the first time (initialization)</li>
<li>When the previous value of the counter is larger than the new one</li>
<li>When the time difference since the last counter update was less than one second</li>
</ul>

Wraps usually happen when a device reboots or when the valid range of the
counter is exceeded and it wraps through again to zero.

The old function <tt>get_counter()</tt> used to raise an exception of type
<tt>MKCounterWrapped</tt>. This exception was handeld by the main core of
Check_MK, which skipped that check for one cycle. The problem were checks
with more than one counter: at the point of initialization the code of the
check wasaborted after the first of these counters had been initialized.
If you had 10 counters, you would need 10 check cycles until the first time
a check result would be returned. So in order to avoid that the check had
to catch the <tt>MKCounterWrapped</tt> itself and handle this situation -
very ugly.

The new function <tt>get_rate</tt> implements a different approach.
Per default no exception is raised in case of a counter wrap, but simply the
value <tt>0.00</tt> is being returned. But Check_MK keeps record of this wrap
event. After the check function has completed (and all counters are handled),
Check_MK creates <i>one final</i> <tt>MKCounterWrapped</tt> exception, so
that the (invalid) check result is being skipped as it should be.  This way
the check programmers' burden is a reduced a bit because now even if the
check has several counters he does not need to catch counter wraps.

In order to give the check more flexibility there are two other behaviours,
that can be selected by the optional argument <tt>onwrap</tt>:

<table>
<tr><th>onwrap</th><th>behaviour</th></tr>
<tr><td class=tt>SKIP</td><td>Skip result of check, after all counters are handled (default)</td></tr>
<tr><td class=tt>RAISE</td><td>Immediately raise a <tt>MKCounterWrapped</tt> exception (legacy behaviour)</td></tr>
<tr><td class=tt>ZERO</td><td>Ignore the wrap and return a rate of 0.0 (be careful!)</td></tr>
</table>

Note: Using <tt>ZERO</tt> is generally <i>not</i> a good idea. This can
make a service jump from CRIT to OK from now and then and generate bogus
notifications.
