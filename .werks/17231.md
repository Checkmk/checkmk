Before this werk, the unit of a custom graph was configured by selecting from a pre-defined list of
units. As of this werk, users have two configuration options:

* **First entry with unit**

  With this setting, the unit of the graph will be set to the unit of the first entry of the custom
  graph that as a known unit. Metrics and scalars always have a known unit. Constants on the other
  hand do not. For operations, it depends on the type of operation. For example, the unit of a sum
  of metrics is computed by traversing through the elements of the sum and using the first found
  unit. On the other hand, the unit of a product is unknown. If no entry has a known unit, the graph
  will be rendered without a unit symbol.

* **Custom**

  This setting opens a sub-dialogue that allows users to customize the graph unit. Users can select
  from multiple notations, set the unit symbol the and the number of decimal places.

When updating to Checkmk 2.4, in most cases, existing custom graphs will be updated automatically to
retain the currently configured unit. The rare cases where this is not possible will be set to
"First entry with unit" during the update.
