Before this werk, the "High utilization at" level option within the 
"Levels over an extended time period on total CPU utilization" target
was limited to a maximum of 101%. However, in environments like containers,
the total CPU utilization can exceed this threshold. This werk therefore removes
the upper limit for the total value.
