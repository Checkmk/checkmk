In some rare cases, when using the Cisco Meraki Special Agent, certain services such as temperature
sensors or device status may be missing. This happened when no device name was configured for a
particular device.

These devices are now added to the main host on which the Cisco Meraki integration is configured.

If you want to monitor the device as a separate piggyback host, you must configure a name for that
device.

The missing services must be discovered by running a service discovery on the main host.
