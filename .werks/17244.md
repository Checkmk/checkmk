This check compares a currently deployed Gerrit instance with newer available releases.

Since Gerrit uses a release cycle similar to semantic versioning [1], this check can monitor when
a major, minor, or patch release is available. With the service configuration, a user can specify
the specific type of release(s) they would like to be notified about.

For example, an administrator may only want to be notified when there is a new patch release, but
isn't concerned about major or minor releases.

[1] **Be aware**: we detected breaking changes in minor and patch releases. Therefore, don't assume
that Gerrit is 100% compliant with semantic versioning. So always check the respective release notes
(linked beside each new version) before upgrading Gerrit. For more information on semantic
versioning, check out: [https://semver.org](https://semver.org).
