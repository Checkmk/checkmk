We previously implemented an update action that would check for invalid
ldap connection ids in the user configs.  However, this change didn't
take into account that a user config doesn't always have a connection
id and would cause a crash on updating.
This werk fixes this issue by checking first if the user config has
a connection id before accessing it.
