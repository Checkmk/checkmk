For notification plugins, the priority option was missing from
available options in the rest-api. This werk fixes this issue by
adding it as an option.  However, this means that the schema
also changes to accomodate for this new option.

Previously, you could set one of the priority options like
this.


'''
"priority": "low"  # "lowest", "high", "normal"

'''

However, the "emergency" priority level adds a few more options,
so now, the schema looks like this

'''
"priority": {
    "level": "low"	# "lowest", "high", "normal"
}
'''

or

'''
"prioriy": {
    "level": "emergency",
	"retry": 60,
	"expire": 360,
	"receipt": "your receipt"
}
'''
