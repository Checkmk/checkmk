When selecting and removing Acknowledgement-type comments, all non-persistent
acknowledgement comments were removed for the respective host or service, even
if they were not selected.

With this werk, only the selected comments are removed in every case. This
allows you to selectively remove acknowledgement comments without resetting the
acknowledgement status of the host or service, as long as other acknowledgement
comments are present.

The acknowledgement status is reset once all acknowledgement comments are
removed.
