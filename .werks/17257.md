In Werk #16377 we renamed the postfix_mailq services in the case where
only a single such service existed. There was a bug which occured in
combination with various linux agents where the service would show up as
UNKNOWN after applying an update, even after rediscovering.

With this werk, the postfix_mailq service will no longer show up as
UNKNOWN.

**Incompatibility**

In various linux agents, the postfix_mailq service will report state
UNKNOWN saying "Item not found in monitoring data" after upgrading. If
that is the case in your environment, simply rediscover the services.
