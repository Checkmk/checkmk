[Werk #16756](https://werks.checkmk.com/16756) introduced the `include_links`
flag to the `Show all hosts` endpoint
(`GET .../domain-types/host_config/collections/all`). The flag was disabled
by default.

This werk changes the default to enabled again. As this comes with a
performance impact, it is recommended to disable it explicitly, if links are not
needed.
