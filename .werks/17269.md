The HTTP proxy setting for Opsgenie has 5 possible settings:
Not configured (default), environment, explicitly disabled, global proxy
settings and explicit proxy settings.
Not configuring the proxy will now use the environment,
as is the case with other notification rules.

Previously, setting the option to environment or explicitly disabled would lead
to errors. These have now been fixed.
