This werk introduces an option to reduce the response size of the "Show all
hosts" endpoint. With this option, the exact fields that are required can be
selected, other keys will be omitted from the response.

The query parameter is called `fields` and uses the following syntax:

1. The field list is to be wrapped in parenthesis `()`
2. An optional exclamation mark `!` at the start negates the entire selection
3. Fields are separated by commas `,`
4. Field names are alphanumeric characters, dashes `-` and underscores `_`.
5. Nested paths to fields are specified with tilde `~` as a separator `field1~field2`
6. Alternatively, parenthesis may be used after a field name `field1(field2,field3)`
7. Both nesting options can be combined `field1~field2(field3,field4)`

Examples:

Select only the host IDs and all their effective attributes:
`.../collections/all?fields=(value(id,extensions~effective_attributes))`

Select everything except links:
`.../collections/all?fields=!(links,value~links)`
