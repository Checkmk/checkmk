When exporting custom host or service attributes in a view, the attributes were
directly concatenated as a string, for example <code>FOO</code> and <code>BAR</code> were exported as
<code>FOOBAR</code>.

Now the exported attributes are exported as comma separated values,
in the example this would be <code>FOO, BAR</code>.
