Grouping services in table views did not previously work as expected.

With [Werk 15494](https://checkmk.com/werk/15494), a new service grouping
feature was introduced that did not work as expected in certain situations after
[Werk 15550](https://checkmk.com/werk/15550) fixed a crash related to
service grouping.

Another issue fixed with [Werk 17278](https://checkmk.com/werk/15494) partially
broke the feature even more.

The original feature also had a bug where when using non-matching
groups, the group title would be displayed incorrectly, in specific situations.

All of the above are now fixed and the original feature is restored and
working again.
