The [new active check for HTTP endpoints](https://checkmk.com/werk/15514) offers the option to
search the response body for strings. This search can be configured to either use a fixed string or
a regular expression. In the latter case, there is the additional option to invert the matching:
Report WARNING if the expression matches and OK if not. This werk fixes two issues related to this
option:

1. In the user interface, the inversion option was incorrectly labelled with "CRITICAL" instead of
"WARNING" in case the expression matches.

2. In the service output, if inversion was activated, a not-matched expression was labelled with
"matched" and a matched expression with "not matched". Note that the actual service state (WARNING
if matched, OK otherwise) was correct.
