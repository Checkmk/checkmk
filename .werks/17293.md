The security fix in [werk 17232](https://checkmk.com/werk/17232) rendered the "Expand/Collapse all"
buttons in the Robot Framework HTML logs dis-functional. As of this werk, these buttons are not
displayed any longer when opening the HTML logs in the Checkmk UI. Note that they are of course
still displayed in the downloaded versions of the logs.
