Both the agent auto-registration (CCE & MSE only) and the automatic host removal depend on
regularly executed background jobs. To facilitate error diagnoses, more logging has been added to
both background jobs. For maximum logging ouput, the corresponding log levels should be set to
"Debug" in the _Logging_ global setting. The log files are written to the folder var/log.
