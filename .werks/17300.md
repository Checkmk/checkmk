Previously, after a WMI error occurred during the generation of 
specific WMI sections, particularly the CpuLoad and DotNetClr sections, 
the agent would stop creating these sections for a period of one 
hour. This was done to reduce noise in the log file. However, 
this approach led to situations where a random WMI failure could 
prevent data collection for an hour.

Since this release, the delay on fail or the CpuLoad and DotNetClr 
sections is eliminated thus making monitoring more smooth.
