<a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/17129">Werk 17129</a> introduced a regression when filtering files according
to the configured globbing and regular expression patterns. In particular, the following combination
never yielded any matches:

LI: A globbing pattern that matches a folder name exactly.
LI: Regular expressions that do <em>not</em> match the folder, but files inside the folder.
