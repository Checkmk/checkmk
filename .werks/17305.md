[Werk 17129](https://checkmk.com/werk/17129) introduced a regression when filtering files according
to the configured globbing and regular expression patterns. In particular, the following combination
never yielded any matches:

* A globbing pattern that matches a folder name exactly.
* Regular expressions that do _not_ match the folder, but files inside the folder.
