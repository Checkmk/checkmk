When rendering metric values, Checkmk separates the numerical value and the unit symbol by a space,
for example "12 s" or "4.67 KiB". As of this werk, in the special case where the unit symbol starts
with a slash, the separating space is avoided: "12/s" instead of "12 /s".

Note that the separator continues to be inserted in case the metric is rendered for example in SI
notation with a prefix: "5.6 M/s" (and not "5.6M/s").
