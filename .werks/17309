If configured, the <tt>Check_MK Agent</tt> service checks the status of the agent updater plugin. In the
case where agent updates where globally enabled but specifically disabled for the host in question,
the setting <tt>State if agent deployment is disabled for host</tt> in the configuration of this service
(rule set <tt>Checkmk Agent installation auditing</tt>) was not respected. Instead, the service of always
reported <tt>WARN</tt>.
