If configured, the <code>Check_MK Agent</code> service checks the status of the agent updater plugin. In the
case where agent updates where globally enabled but specifically disabled for the host in question,
the setting <code>State if agent deployment is disabled for host</code> in the configuration of this service
(rule set <code>Checkmk Agent installation auditing</code>) was not respected. Instead, the service of always
reported <code>WARN</code>.
