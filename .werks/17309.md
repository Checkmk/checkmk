If configured, the _Check\_MK Agent_ service checks the status of the agent updater plugin. In the
case where agent updates where globally enabled but specifically disabled for the host in question,
the setting _State if agent deployment is disabled for host_ in the configuration of this service
(rule set _Checkmk Agent installation auditing_) was not respected. Instead, the service of always
reported _WARN_.
