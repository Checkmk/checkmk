If configured, the `Check_MK Agent` service checks the status of the agent updater plugin. In the
case where agent updates where globally enabled but specifically disabled for the host in question,
the setting `State if agent deployment is disabled for host` in the configuration of this service
(rule set `Checkmk Agent installation auditing`) was not respected. Instead, the service of always
reported `WARN`.
