With the <code>maxcontextlines</code> option the output of the mk_logwatch agent plugin can be reduced to a certain number of lines before and after relevant messages.
Previously the messages were seen as relevant if they had the level <code>W</code>(warning) or <code>C</code>(critical).
With this werk messages that are marked with <code>O</code> (OK/informational) are also considered relevant and will have the context applied.
