Customers using the Enterprise Edition need to submit a license report at least twice per subscription period.
Previously this had done be done manually, either via online or offline submission.
To make this process easier, the report will now be uploaded automatically every 7 days if under "Setup > Maintenance > Licensing > Edit settings" "Online submission" is chosen and the right credentials are configured.
The license information submitted can be viewed transparently at any time on the "Edit settings" and "License usage" pages.
