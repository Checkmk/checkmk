If an already licensed Checkmk site is upgraded to an edition where a license is required (Cloud, Managed), an incompatible license would mean that certain functionality (e.g. activation of changes) is restricted.
To make the upgrade process easier, the incompatible license is removed, requiring a suitable license to be applied.

To see what license is compatible with which edition, see [werk #17310](https://checkmk.com/werk/17310).
