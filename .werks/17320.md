The `429 (Too Many Requests)` error was frequently raised when monitoring Azure usage details.
This problem was caused by the high number of queries, performed to retrieve the usage details,
due to pagination with a limited number of items per page, and due to the `ClientType` quota
limit (see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1340993/exception-429-too-many-requests-for-azure-cost-man).

This werk increases the number of items retrieved by each individual API call
and specifies a `ClientType` in the request header.
