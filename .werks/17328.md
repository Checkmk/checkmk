The *storcli* application, launched by the Checkmk Linux agent, created log files in the root directory (/),
the execution directory, violating LSB specifications.

With this update, the *storcli* command will now be executed in /var/lib/check_mk_agent/.

This change is considered incompatible because users must:
- Manually move any related *storcli* ini files from / to /var/lib/check_mk_agent/
- Manually delete any *storcli* log files already created in the root directory (/)
