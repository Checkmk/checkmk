This werk impacts all those who monitor Netapp qtree.

The `netapp_ontap_qtree_quota' check plugin incorrectly calculated and displayed
storage values that were larger by a factor of 1024 (e.g. 200TB instead of 200GB).
This has now been fixed.

This werk is flagged as incompatible because the user will see a drop in the metric values
and the used/free space levels set in the past will need to be manually readjusted to the new, correct scale.
