When using a `|` symbol in the display name of an azure app, the
azure_app_registration check would fail with
`WARNING: Parsing of section azure_app_registration failed - please submit a crash report!`.

With this werk, we fix this error and support the `|` symbol in the
display name of azure apps.

**User action required**

To apply the fix, you need to rediscover the `azure_app_registration`
services.
