Title: Fix pushed MKPs in distributed monitoring being impossible to disable

If you enabled the "Replicate extensions" option under "Distributed Monitoring",
MKPs that were enabled on the central site would be enabled on the remote site.
When a remote site was then updated to 2.2.0, it was no longer possible to disable
the MKP on the remote site.

When trying to disable an MKP in such a scenario, it would fail with the error message
"Package {package_name} {package_version} is not enabled".

With this werk, we now make sure that MKPs are properly installed when upgrading
a remote site with pushed MKPs. This allows you to disable MKPs on the remote site.
