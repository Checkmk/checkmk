If you enabled the "Replicate extensions" option under "Distributed Monitoring",
MKPs that were enabled on the central site would be enabled on the remote site.
When a remote site was then updated to 2.2.0, it was no longer possible to disable
the MKP on the remote site.

When trying to disable an MKP in such a scenario, it would fail with the error message
"Package {package_name} {package_version} is not enabled".

With this werk, we now make sure that MKPs are properly installed when upgrading
a remote site with pushed MKPs. This allows you to disable MKPs on the remote site.
