When invalid host names were passed into the "Explicit hosts" condition
while creating or editing a rule, Checkmk would crash with the message
`Internal error: Invalid hostaddress: '{explicit hosts condition}'.

With this werk, the form will warn you that you have entered an invalid
*Explicit hosts* condition. This allows you to fix the error without
losing the rest of the entered inputs.
