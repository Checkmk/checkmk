This werk was intended to fix the problem that the "cmk/site" label
of hosts would always return the currently running site as its value.

This werk however did not affect your monitoring and did not fix the
mentioned problem.

This werk was originally marked as incompatible, but did not have any
effect, so it was changed to compatible. It was basically replaced
by [Werk #17915](https://checkmk.com/werk/17915).
