With the global configuration option "Limit login to single session at
a time", we allow limiting the active sessions per user.

This setting defines a time out until a new session can be opened.

Previously, this time out needed to be awaited before a new session
could be opened.

With this werk, we allow creation of a new session if the user has
logged out of a previous session.
