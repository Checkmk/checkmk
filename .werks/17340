Title: Registering agents without automation user
Class: fix

Version: 2.2.0p36

This is only relevant if you use the managed edition and you set the automation user to belong to the provider!

If the automation user is marked to belong to the *provider* the user is not synchronized to the customer sites.
When registering an agent the agent receiver queries the RestAPI in order to get the configuration for the configured lifetime of agent certificates.
In order to authenticate the agent receiver tries to use the automation user.
This failed with an uncaught exception if that automation user does not exists.
In 2.3.0 we switched to another authentication scheme which is not available in 2.2.0, therefore these cases are now caught and the default lifetime (5 years) is used.
