When the agent updater is configured to communicate with the bakery through the remote site (as described in the chapter [Agent updates in distributed monitoring](https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/agent_deployment.html#distr_wato), the remote site executes HTTP request to the central site.
To authenticate this request the automation user `automation` was used.

With this Werk a remote site with version 2.4 or higher and a remote site with version 2.4 or higher will use a different authentication scheme.
For that scheme we use the already present secret for authenticating the central site to the remote site just in opposite direction.

If the central site is older than 2.4 (de facto 2.3 since only one version difference is allowed) the remote site will fallback to using the automation user `automation`.
