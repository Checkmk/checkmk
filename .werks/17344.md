Previous to this Werk when you created a user with an automation secret this secret was stored hashed in `$OMD_ROOT/etc/htpasswd` and in clear text in `var/check_mk/web/$username/automation.secret`.
This cleartext secret could then be used by Checkmk or other scripts run as site user to authenticate against the web interface.

With this Werk a newly created site does no longer create an automation user named `automation` since it is no longer required internally.

Automation users still work, but the secret for a newly created automation user is no longer stored in cleartext.
New automation users will not work with rules using the automation secret.
This affects features like the agent bakery and auto-registration (commercial editions).
For these features you can explicitly enable *Store the secret in cleartext* in the *Add user* dialog.
The cleartext secrets for existing users are not removed during an update.

In case you have scripts running on the Checkmk server that make use of the `automation.secret` file, make sure you checked the *Store the secret in cleartext* option for that user or change your scripts to obtain the secret differently.
