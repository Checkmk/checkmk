Long time ago, in Checkmk 1.6.0, we introduced with Werk #6679 the datasource program `BI Aggregations` as a much more powerful alternative to the existing active check `Check State of BI Aggregation`, which had several shortcomings.
With the removal of the automation user, which is required for `Check State of BI Aggregation`, it is now finally time to deprecate this feature. Existing rules will still work, but no more new rules are possible.

Please migrate to `BI Aggregations` as `Check State of BI Aggregation` will be removed with Checkmk 2.5.0.
