Currently, the check disregards the custom parameters set by the user, always returning the state
defined by the SNMP mapping. With this change, the service now compares the current state with the
required state defined by the user in the check parameters. If there is a mismatch, a "CRIT" result
will be yielded, comparing the actual and expected plug state. Otherwise, an "OK" result will be
yielded with the plug state.

Note: if these parameters are not explicitly set for your service, the service will compare the
current state with the state set during service discovery. If you do have configured parameters,
there are no changes needed for this fix.
