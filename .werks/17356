The plugin output and comments are saved in a Nagios-compatible format
(semi-colon-separated). Therefore, it is necessary to escape semi-colons
to <code>%3B</code> when writing out history.

In the GUI, where plugin output or comments from the monitoring history
are displayed, we can translate <code>%3B</code> back to a semi-colon using a
simple replace.
