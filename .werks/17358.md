Before this fix, the site would reload every 0.8 seconds on the background jobs
overview page. This was problematic because the user couldn't perform any actions
during this small time window. Instead, they would jump to the top of the overview
page on each refresh.

This change removes the auto refresh functionality. So, now it is up to the user to
manually refresh when they want to see the current status of a job.
