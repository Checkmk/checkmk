You may be affected by this werk in case you're using systemd service templates in combination with <tt>indirect</tt> units.

Previous to this werk, the enabled state of your service was determined by looking at its unit file which may have indicated <tt>indirect</tt>.
This will result in the service beeing considered as <tt>disabled</tt> and therefore won't affect the status of the (Checkmk) service in case you've been using the summary check.

As the agent section <tt>systemd_units</tt> delivers also the <tt>status</tt> of a systemd service, the check can derive the enabled status from this information.
Since this information was not always present from the agent, a fall back to use the information <tt>list-unit-files</tt> is still in place.
