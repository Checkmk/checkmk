You're affected by this werk in case you have multiple expired licenses on your prism system.

A possible backtrace may look like:
```
File "/omd/sites/SITE/lib/python3.12/site-packages/cmk/agent_based/v1/_checking_classes.py", line 447, in _create_result_fields
  raise ValueError("'\\n' not allowed in 'summary'")
```

The problematic newline characters are now rendered in a compatible way and the check continues to work.
