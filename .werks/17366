Title: Parsing systemd units which trigger others

In case a <code>systemd</code> unit will trigger others, a <code>systemctl</code> output may look like:

C+:
Triggers: ● check-mk-agent@3148-1849349-997.service
● check-mk-agent@3149-1849349-997.service
C-:

This led to falsely parsed data from the <code>systemd status</code> section. CPU or memory may have been mixed up between the units.

This is fixed now.
