In case a `systemd` unit will trigger others, a `systemctl` output may look like:
```
Triggers: ● check-mk-agent@3148-1849349-997.service
● check-mk-agent@3149-1849349-997.service
```
This led to falsely parsed data from the `systemd status` section. CPU or memory may have been mixed up between the units.

This is fixed now.
