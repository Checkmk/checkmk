You may be affected by this werk in case you're using systemd service templates in combination with <code>indirect</code> units.

Previous to this werk, the enabled state of your service was determined by looking at its unit file which may have indicated <code>indirect</code>.
This will result in the service beeing considered as <code>disabled</code> and therefore won't affect the status of the (Checkmk) service in case you've been using the summary check.

As the agent section <code>systemd_units</code> delivers also the <code>status</code> of a systemd service, the check can derive the enabled status from this information.
Since this information was not always present from the agent, a fall back to use the information <code>list-unit-files</code> is still in place.
