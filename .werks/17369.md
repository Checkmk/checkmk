You are affected by this werk if:

- you're using the netapp ontap special agent
- you're using the failover policiy `home_node_only`
- you have used the deprecated special agent via webapi and set custom failover groups.

Before this werk, the `home_node_only` policy would have taken all ports of the home node into consideration.
As per netapp's documentation, failover groups do not exists anymore in the rest API:
```
The common practice will be to use default failover groups, which are all the ports of a broadcast domain. Custom failover groups are not presented in the REST API.
```

The consequence is, that the ports of the broadcast domains are now considered and only those which are on the home node.
