Title: Ship python package "oracledb" with omd
Class: feature
Compatible: compat

Version: 2.2.0p41

The active check <tt>check_sql</tt> uses the python package <tt>oracledb</tt>.
Previously, the user needed to install this package by hand. This situation may have caused issues during an omd update regarding python requirements resolution.

In order to avoid such issues, we simply now ship the python package and avoid the need for a user to install the package by hand.

<tt>Update Notes</tt>
In case, you used the previously recommend installation process `pip install oracledb` as site user, you will need to remove the local installation manually via `pip uninstall oracledb`.
We further noticed that the new version of oracledb v3.0.0 would not work as expected. In such cases we recommend to update to `2.3.0p28` to avoid custom installations.
