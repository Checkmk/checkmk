The active check <tt>check_sql</tt> uses the python package <tt>oracledb</tt>.
Previously, the user needed to install this package by hand. This situation may have caused issues during an omd update regarding python requirements resolution.

In order to avoid such issues, we simply now ship the python package and avoid the need for a user to install the package by hand.
