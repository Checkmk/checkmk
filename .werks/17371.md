Previously, the AIX agent was using `entstat` to indentify interfaces which are `down`.

This was not working reliable on AIX systems which run on a virtual machine.
`ifconfig` can deliver that information reliable, so we're now doing the switch.

To take benefit of the described change, the user is required to update the AIX agent on the monitored hosts.
