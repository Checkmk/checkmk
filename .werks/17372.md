You're affected by this werk in case you are:
<ul>
<li>monitoring docker containers with <tt>mk_docker</tt></li>
<li>observing your DiskIO service becoming UNKNOWN after a container restart</li>
</ul>

The main reason for this behaviour is that the docker API is not returning any metrics in case no Disk IO has happened (yet) in your newly started container.
One possible way to observe this, is to look at the corresponding system file, which is empty:
<code>
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/system.slice/docker-CONTAINER_ID.scope/io.stat
</code>

<tt>mk_docker</tt> will respond in that case with all metrics beeing null, e.g.:
<code>
{"io_service_bytes_recursive": null, "io_serviced_recursive": null, "io_queue_recursive": null, "io_service_time_recursive": null, "io_wait_time_recursive": null, "io_merged_recursive": null, "io_time_recursive": null, "sectors_recursive": null, "time": 1735809729.685249, "names": {"7:1": "loop1", "7:6": "loop6", "7:4": "loop4", "11:0": "sr0", "7:2": "loop2", "7:0": "loop0", "7:7": "loop7", "8:0": "sda", "7:5": "loop5", "7:3": "loop3"}}
</code>

As this is a valid scenario for docker containers, the service will now handle this with a PENDING status.
