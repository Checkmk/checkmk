In case you have been trying to setup monitoring for postgres 15 under windows, you might encountered the following trace back:

```
  File "C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\plugins\mk_postgres.py", line 582, in _psql_path
    raise IOError("Could not determine %s bin and its path." % self.psql_binary_name)
OSError: Could not determine psql bin and its path.
```

This limitation was artifically till now and we confirmed during internal testing that we're actually postgres 15 compatible.
