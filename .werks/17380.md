This Werk fixes a regression that was introduced by a combination of the Werks [#16661](https://checkmk.com/werk/16661) and [#16766](https://checkmk.com/werk/16766).

Instead of maintaining old service names as mentioned in Werk #16766, new services with replacement characters instead of IP addresses, like "OMD \<site\> Notification Spooler connection to /1", would be discovered in some situations.
