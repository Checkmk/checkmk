When configuring the elasticsearch special agent at the _Elasticsearch_ ruleset,
you can choose to skip TLS Certificate verification.

Previously, this entry was titled "SSL certificate verification", but configuring it
actually lead to *skipping* verification.
Additionally, due to the nature of our rulesets, enabling the checkbox didn't activate
the option rightaway, but only activated the entry, yielding an additional untitled checkbox
that's used to do the actual configuration.

The ruleset entry is now correctly titled "Skip SSL certificate verification" and on activation
yields the checkbox with meaningful title "Skip verification (insecure)".
