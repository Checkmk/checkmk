This Werk fixes a regression that got introduced with Werk #16557.
Only Checkmk 2.3 is affected.
While Werk #16557 fixed the situation where cached packages were not cleaned up,
we accidentally introduced a bug where packages do get cleaned up too often.

With this Werk, agent packages will be cached on remote sites when requested from
a host, and only get deleted when the package is no longer existant on the central
site.
