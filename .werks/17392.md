Robotmk can be configured to execute plans as a specific user. The standard use case is that one or
more tests of a plan need access to the Windows desktop. In case the plan user was a not an
administrator, building the RCC environment of the plan might have failed (if configured). The
scheduler status service went CRITICAL and reported
"Plan '...': Environment building failed, see service details. Plan won't be scheduled."
in this case.
