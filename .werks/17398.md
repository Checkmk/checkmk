The command `cmk-piggyback` is added to provide analysis tools for piggyback related features.
It is designed as an interactive admin tool, and **does not provide a stable interface** for scripting.

For more details please refer to the output of the commands `--help` option.

Currently the tool includes commands to

 * display all host that deliver piggyback sections ("sources")
 * display all host for which sections are delivered ("piggybacked")
 * display all piggybacked hosts that are not in the monitoring ("orphans")
 * track all incoming piggyback sections
 * create piggyback sections for testing purposes
