This only affects users that configured the rule _"Fetch intervals for SNMP sections"_ for the section "if64".

If users configured a custom fetch interval for this section, but _not_ for the "uptime" section, the service graphs would exhibit a sawtooth pattern.
Measured values would jump between zero and a too large value (by a factor proportional to the configured interval).

This is fixed now, and the reported values are correct.
Note that the graph will still have interruptions, as correct rates can only be computed when new SNMP data is fetched and not inbetween.

Affected users might want to disable this rule during the upgrade, as the service will crash until the section has been fetched again.
