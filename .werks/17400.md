With Checkmk 2.4 we will start shipping some preconfigured rules for the ruleset _"Process discovery"_.

Every host that has the host label `cmk/check_mk_server:yes` we will discover the following services for each site:

 * active check helpers
 * agent receiver
 * alert helper
 * apache
 * checker helpers
 * cmc
 * dcd
 * event console
 * fetcher helpers
 * jaeger
 * livestatus proxy
 * notification spooler
 * notify helper
 * piggyback hub
 * rabbitmq
 * real-time helper
 * redis-server
 * rrdcached
 * rrd helper

If you don't like these services, you can disable the rule.
Note that if _all_ of the shipped rules are _deleted_ (rather than disabled), they will be added during every patch uppgrade.
