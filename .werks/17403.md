Clustered services never had any discovered service labels.
They now have the union of all service labels that are discovered on the nodes.
In case different values of the same service label are discovered on the nodes,
the nodes appearing first in the cluster definition take precedence.

Rulesets matching based on service labels will now match on the clustered
services as expected.
