The redfish integration that was available as optional _Extension package_ is now a regular part of Checkmk.

It adds support for _Redfish_ compatible devices.
For a list of added plugins please refer to our [Catalog of Check Plug-ins](https://checkmk.com/integrations?distributions%5B%5D=check_mk&distributions%5B%5D=check_mk_cloud&search=redfish).

On installations where the extension package was enabled, it should be disabled after the upgrade.
After switching to the shipped plugins, some services will need to be rediscovered.
