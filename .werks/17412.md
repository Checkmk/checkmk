Prior to this werk, the Cisco temperature check raised an exception
whenever a sensor threshold lacked complete informationâ€”specifically,
if any of the severity, relation, or threshold values were missing.
This caused both the discovery and check processes to fail. The updated
behavior addresses this issue by first verifying whether a threshold value
is defined and ignoring sensors that do not have one. However, if a
threshold value is defined but either the severity, relation, or both are
missing, an exception will now be raised instead of skipping over the incomplete
threshold.
