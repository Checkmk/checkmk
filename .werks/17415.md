In Setup / hosts, we have switched the icon order.  Previously
we had

1. Edit the properties of the host
2. View the rule based effective parameters of this host
3. Run service discovery
4. Move this host to another folder
5. Open the host action menu

and we have swapped 2 and 3 so that it's now

 1. Edit the properties of the host
 2. Run service discovery
 3. View the rule based effective parameters of this host
 4. Move this host to another folder
 5. Open the host action menu
