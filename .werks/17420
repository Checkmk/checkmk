Given the following scenario:

<ol>
<li>Two ldap connections configured</li>
<li>Both ldap instances have a user with the same name</li>
<li>The connectors are configured with a suffix</li>
<li>The connectors have "Create users only on login" enabled.</li>
</ol>


we found that when the second user logged in, they were granted
access but the correct user role was not being assigned.

This werk now fixes this issue.
