Given the following scenario:

1. Two ldap connections configured
2. Both ldap instances have a user with the same name
3. The connectors are configured with a suffix
4. The connectors have "Create users only on login" enabled.

we found that when the second user logged in, they were granted
access but the correct user role was not being assigned.

This werk now fixes this issue.
