Robotmk now offers the option to use pre-built RCC environments for Robot Framework test executions.
These environments are built on a machine with internet access and can subsequently be used on test
nodes without internet access (for example, in a high-security environment).

Two modes are available for transferring pre-built environments to a test node:
1. The environment is packaged as a ZIP file and subsequently transferred to the test node by the
end user. In this case, the Robotmk configuration contains the path to the ZIP file on the test
node.
2. The end user runs an RCC remote server, which distributes the pre-built environments to the test
nodes. In this case, the Robotmk configuration contains the RCC remote server address.

Please consult the user manual for further details and instructions.
