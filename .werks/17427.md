This new feature allows for distributing Robot Framework test definitions with the Checkmk agent
bakery. Whereas in Checkmk 2.3, users had to manually distribute the test definitions to their test
nodes (which is of course still supported), Checkmk 2.4 offers the option to upload them as archive
files into the Checkmk site. These uploaded test definitions, together with the associated plan
configurations, are called managed robots. When configuring a Robotmk bakery rule, the currently
uploaded managed robots can be selected without the need for further configuration.

Please consult the user manual for further details and instructions.
