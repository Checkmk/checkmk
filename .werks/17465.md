Dashlets of type "Sidebar element" did not respect the current show more
options of the user.
If you e.g. added a "Overview" element and the sidebar snapin was changed to
"Show more", the dashlet content still showed only the default content.

This has been fixed.

Note: The dashlet still has to refresh to take the current settings of a
sidebar element into account.
