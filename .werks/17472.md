User messages send via "Setup" - "User" - "Send user message" with option "Show
hint in the 'User' menu" will show a link for new messages in the "User" menu.

As security messages will now be kept for a defined time, this hint would be
shown for the lifetime of that messages.

We now added a new Topic within the "User" menu, named "User messages".
Via the entry "Received messages" in this topic, you get to your personal user
messages page.

This page now allows to acknowledge one or all messages, removing the hint from
the "User" menu.
