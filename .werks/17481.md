The "Report scheduler" view was difficult to use due to an automatic 2 second refresh. The view was
essentially unusable while the background report generation was still running.

With this fix, the automatic refresh is now removed. It is now up to the user to perform a manual
refresh when they want to see the current state of the background job.
