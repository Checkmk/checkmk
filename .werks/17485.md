The authentication and access to AWS resources can now be configured explicitly in the following cases:

* ***access key ID***
    * the previous default authentication method
    * required for non AWS hosted Checkmk instances
* ***access key ID + IAM-Role***
    * required for non AWS hosted Checkmk instances
    * assuming a certain (3rd party) AWS IAM role
* ***only IAM-Role***
    * **new** added **method**
    * for AWS-hosted Checkmk instances only
    * no access key ID required
    * assuming a certain (3rd party) AWS IAM role
* ***none***
    * **new** added **method**
    * for AWS-hosted Checkmk instances only
    * no access key ID required
    * using the AWS EC2 instance role of the Checkmk instance

The configuration "***only IAM-Role***"" and "***none***" especially allow omitting an access key ID, when the **Checkmk instance** is **hosted on an AWS EC2** instance. This allows to fully benefit from the **best practices of AWS Security Token Service** (additional AWS IAM configurations may be required).
