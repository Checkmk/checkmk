The Chrome browser incorrectly auto-fills the Documentation URL field of service rule forms with pre-saved usernames. This fix prevents the Chrome browser from misbehaving.

To be more specific, Chrome violates this web standard, by which the attribute `autocomplete="off"`  tells browsers to not auto-fill an input field. For Chrome (and Chromium-based browsers) only a non-standard value (e.g., `autocomplete="one-time-code"`) will prevent Chrome from actually filling the input field.
