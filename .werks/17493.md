The link creation for the Customer column reused all existing http GET parameters.
This caused non-existent sort and filter values to be injected into the corresponding linked "All hosts of customer" view, which also caused the page to crash on several occasions.

Now, no parameters from the previous views are used to create the link, and the "All Hosts of Customer" view is opened without any non-corresponding sort or filter values.
