We allow specifying the log level of various checkmk components in the
global settings. In previous versions, when setting the "LDAP" log level
to "Debug" under Global Settings > User Interface > Logging while having
an LDAP integration configured, a trace of each function call to the
`python-ldap` library would be written to the `var/log/apache/error_log`
file. These traces might for example include user names and clear
passwords of each login attempt.

With this werk, we rework the "Debug" log level of our LDAP integration
and will no longer log these traces to the `var/log/apache/error_log`
file.

We thank an external contributer for reporting this issue.

*Affected Versions*:

* 2.3.0
* 2.2.0
* 2.1.0 (EOL)

*Mitigations*:

If you are unable to apply this update, set the log level of "LDAP" to
any other value than "Debug" to not be affected by this vulnerability.

*Indicators of Compromise*:

You have been exposed to this vulnerability if the file
`var/log/apache/error_log` lists any function calls to the `ldap`
library as follows

```
    *** <ldap.ldapobject.ReconnectLDAPObject object at {addr}> {ldap_url} - ReconnectLDAPObject.simple_bind, referer: {checkmk_site}/check_mk/login.py
    (('cn={user_name},ou=benutzer,dc=corp,dc=de', {password}, None, None), {}), referer: {checkmk_site}/check_mk/login.py
```

*Vulnerability Management:*
