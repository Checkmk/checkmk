Previously, the page to list backups from a backup target might crash if
querying the backup files takes too long. This might happen when there
is a large number files in a remote backup target or when the request is
running with a slow internet connection.

With this Werk, the page will no longer crash. It will instead show an
incomplete list of backups that could be queried until the timeout was
reached.

A warning is displayed at the top of the page if the list of backups is
not complete. When encountering this warning, you might want to remove
unneeded files from your remote backup target.
