If you are monitoring an Aruba network WLAN controller access point
with the `aruba_wlc_aps` check, it will crash if there are non-ASCII
characters in the monitored acces point SSID.

With this werk, the check will no longer crash when encountering SSIDs
with any utf-8 character.

Thanks to github user mabezi for the patch.
