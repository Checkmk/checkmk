The apc_symmetra rule to monitor aspects of an APC Symmetra UPS 
did not result in any services when running on the v7 firmware.

This was caused by a shorter identifying OID for the v7 version of the firmware.

In this werk, we add support for the v7 firmware and additionally
monitor whether the connection to the UPS can be established.
