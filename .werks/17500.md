Users with the permissions "Edit foreign custom/forecast graphs" can edit custom/forecast graphs
owned by other users, even if they haven't been published. However, attempting to edit the design
(custom graph)/the model (forecast graph) of an unpublished custom/forecast graph owned by another
user resulted in the error message "No graph with the ID ...".
