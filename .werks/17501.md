The API of the endpoint for downloading graph images introduced in werk
[#4733](https://checkmk.com/werk/4733) was changed incompatibly. The new request format is as
follows:
```
{
    "specification": {
        "site": "my_site",
        "host_name": "my_host",
        "service_description": "My Service",
        "graph_type": "template",
    }
}
```
The corresponding URL reads
```
http://.../my_site/check_mk/graph_image.py?request={"specification": {"site": "my_site", "host_name": "my_host", "service_description": "My Service", "graph_type": "template"}}
```
Please adjust any queries to this endpoint accordingly.
