Before, the MSSQL jobs monitoring only included the job name in the service description. Hence, in
the case where a job with the same name was configured on multiple instances, only one service was
discovered and therefore, only one of these jobs was monitored.

As of this werk, the instance name is included in the service description:
`MSSQL job {job_name} - {instance_name}`.
This enables monitoring all jobs in the scenario described above.

This werk is incompatible because users need to re-discover the services of affected hosts.
Furthermore, users might have to adjust the service rules of the MSSQL job services if they
restricted them based on the service item.
