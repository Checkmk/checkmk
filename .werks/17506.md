This change reintroduces the deprecated `DELETE /domain-types/audit_log/collections/all` endpoint.
It was accidentally removed as part of [Werk 17174](https://checkmk.com/werk/17174)
and will be removed again in Checkmk 2.4.

Users should instead use archive action described in [Werk 16367](https://checkmk.com/werk/16367).
