Previously, even if the Windows agent installer file was correctly 
deployed with MKP, the Bakery would ignore it.
This issue has been resolved in the current release.

Important. It is now allowed—and encouraged—to include unsigned MSI 
files in an MKP package. However, if a signed MKP must be deployed 
for any reason, the author of the MKP must also provide an unsigned 
patch file named `unsign-msi.patch` alongside the installer file.
Otherwise, the customer may encounter issues during installation on 
the target system.
