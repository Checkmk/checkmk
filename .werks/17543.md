This option was available in previous versions but stopped working properly due 
to a regression introduced in version 2.3. As a result, it was removed from the 
installer's GUI in version 2.4.

Starting with this version, the issue has been resolved. The option now works 
correctly again and has been reintroduced in the installer GUI.
