Previously, some WMI based checks, such as `msexchange` 
and `dotnet_clrmemory`, would crash and generate a crash 
report if a WMI timeout occurred. Since WMI timeouts are 
expected to happen occasionally, this behavior was not 
appropriate. Moreover, these crash reports provided no 
useful diagnostic information and only cluttered the 
disk.

Now, instead of crashing, all WMI based checks will 
correctly handle the timeout by skipping the data,  
eventually setting the service state to **STALE**,  
thus making WMI monitoring uniform and consistent.
