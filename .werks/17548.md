Since the version 2.4 the connector configuration keys 
`activation_throttle` and `activation_exclude_times` have 
been removed from the GUI following the implementation 
of new activation logic.

However, configurations generated by previous version 
may still include these obsolete keys. Due to a known 
issue, the Connector GUI could misbehave when 
encountering these deprecated keys.

This release automatically filters out any occurrences 
of `activation_throttle` and `activation_exclude_times` 
from the connector configuration, ensuring compatibility 
with the updated GUI and preventing related issues.

No manual action is requiredâ€”obsolete keys will be 
safely ignored and excluded.

If needed, users may reintroduce `activation_exclude_times` 
as a DCD Global parameter.
