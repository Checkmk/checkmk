Changes to a user's two-factor configurations within a central site will now be immediately synchronized with remote sites, previously this required a manual activation of changes. These configurations include:

* Adding or removing of an authentication application.
* Adding or removing of a security token.
* Changing the alias of any two-factor method.
* Generating, using or revoking of backup codes.

** Be advised that changes to two-factor configurations in a remote site will not affect its central site users. **
