The `EMC VNX` special agent has been deprecated as of Checkmk 2.4.0. This agent allowed monitoring of `EMC VNX storage systems` by the use of the Dell's `Navisphere Secure CLI (NavisecCLI)` tooling.

Dell replaced `EMC VNX` with `EMC Unity` in 2016, which has lead to `EMC VNX` being maintained more sparsely and this drop of support has left the tool reliant on outdated and potentially dangerous dependencies. 

The `EMC VNX` special agent will be fully removed from Checkmk in `2.5.0` and will be made available on the Checkmk Exchange (`exchange.checkmk.com`), should it still be required.
