This change affects users, which use the `apc_humidity` check and rely on the default configuration.
In the default configuration, the service is always critical.

This was because the lower levels `(60.0, 65.0)` were above the upper levels `(40.0, 35.0)`.
In fact, the intended behaviour, which is also described by the manpage, was that the two levels were switched.
With this Werk, the behaviour of the check matches the manpage description.

The old behaviour can be restored by configuring the rule `Humidity Levels`.
