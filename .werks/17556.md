In [#Werk 16408](https://checkmk.com/werk/16408), it was made possible to safely abort the update if a conflict occurs.
After an update was aborted, `omd` would set the permissions of the home directory `/omd/sites/{site_name}` to rwxr-x---.
This is an issue, since `omd create` sets the permissions of this directory to rwxr-x--x.
Moreover, after an update is aborted the permissions should be exactly the same as before the attempt failed.

There is a specific reason for this set of permissions.
If the home directory of a site cannot be read, then another site will display the error:
```
ERROR: Failed to read config /omd/sites/{site_name}/etc/omd/site.conf of site {site_name}. APACHE_TCP_PORT port will possibly be allocated twice
```
This error is displayed, whenever a port is allocated using `omd config set`.
In case you see this error message, ensure that your site has the correct permissions.
The permissions should look like this:
```sh
# ls -lh /omd/sites/stable
drwxr-x--x 10 stable stable 4.0K Jan 20 17:36 /omd/sites/stable
# ls -ldh /omd/sites/stable/etc/
drwxr-x--x 21 stable stable 4.0K Jan 20 17:37 /omd/sites/stable/etc/
# ls -ldh /omd/sites/stable/etc/omd/
drwxr-x--x 2 stable stable 4.0K Jan 20 17:36 /omd/sites/stable/etc/omd/
# ls -lh /omd/sites/stable/etc/omd/site.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 stable stable 601 Jan 20 17:36 /omd/sites/stable/etc/omd/site.conf
```

With this Werk, `omd` correctly restore of the home directory to what they were before the update.
