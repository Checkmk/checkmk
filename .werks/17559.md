The Agent Bakery creates agent packages in the `~/var/check_mk/agents` directory. These files can be easily recreated on demand. At the same time, the size of these packages may be quite large. With this Werk the directory `~/var/check_mk/agents` can be excluded from backups as follows:
```
omd backup --no-agents
```
Moreover, using `omd backup --no-past` will also omit `~/var/check_mk/agents` directory.

We thank the community for driving this feature.
