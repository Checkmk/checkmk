During the update, the `omd` configuration file `etc/omd/site.conf` can change. Examples of this are

* adding default parameters for new services and
* changing ports, which are occupied by a different site.

`omd` marks the stage at which it can no longer abort the update via this message:
```
Completed verifying site configuration. Your site now has version {version}.
```
However, there might still be errors, which prevent configuration from being updated, and which are indicated during the final part of the update with an 'ERROR' message.
Previously, `omd` would not save its own configuration file `etc/omd/site.conf` in such cases.
This may be observed if changing editions with `omd update`, and the user chooses to ignore a conflict and continue the update.
