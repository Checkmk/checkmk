Due to a regression introduced in the version 2.3.0, the environment variable `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` was not taken into account. This resulted in
```
SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1006)')))
```
being raised if running `agent_kube` against instances using self signed certificates.

This change reimplements [Werk #16892](https://checkmk.com/werk/16892).
The previous Werk did not implement the certificate handling for the Kubernetes API client or the OpenShift client.
For this reason, some users did not see any change in behaviour after the Werk was released.

With this change, `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` and `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` are taken into account.
The implementation mentioned by [Werk #16892](https://checkmk.com/werk/16892) needed to be replaced, see [Werk #17562](https://checkmk.com/werk/17562).
