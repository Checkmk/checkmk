Previously, the Elasticsearch agent queried the statistics for the configured Elasticsearch node
with the hard-coded filter `*-*`, thus retrieving only the statistics for indices containing the `-` symbol.

This filter has now been removed and the ruleset adjusted accordingly:
it is now possible to specify which filter to apply, following the guidelines provided here:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-stats.html

The rules set prior to this werk are automatically converted,
and the `*-*` pattern is applied to maintain compatibility, so no user intervention is required.
