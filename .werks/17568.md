This werk affects anyone monitoring Oracle PDB instances.

The oracle_instance service displayed an incorrect perf-o-meter, for the `fs_size` metric, in the user interface.

With this werk a new metric `oracle_pdb_total_size` is introduced and the perf-o-meter has been fixed.

No user intervention is required, as the old `fs_site` metric for this service
is now translated into the new `oracle_pdb_total_size`.
