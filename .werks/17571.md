This werk impacts all those who monitor Netapp ports.

From this werk, services monitoring ports in status _down_
won't be discovered, mimicking the behaviour of the previous deprecated check,
developed against the old NetApp API.

This werk is flagged as incompatible because the user will find services,
which were previously in the UNKNOWN state, vanished during a new discovery.
