In the Dynamic Host Management (dcd) rule creation interface
for hosts created by the open telemetry collector,
the following default host attributes have been changed:

the former _Monitoring agents: SNMP - No SNMP_
(which is anyway a default setting for new hosts) has been replaced by
_Monitoring agents: Checkmk agent / API integrations -_
_Configured API integrations, no Checkmk agent._
