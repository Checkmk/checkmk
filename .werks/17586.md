This werk modifies the execute bulk discovery endpoint:

* a bulk discovery job gets a dedicated job id
* multiple bulk discovery jobs can be requested but only one job will run at a time
* non running jobs will be queued until the active one has finished
* the endpoint redirects to the background job status endpoint
* the old bulk discovery status endpoint `objects/discovery_run/{job_id}` is removed and the background status endpoint `objects/background_job/{job_id}` should be used instead

The redirect will return the response schema of the background job status endpoint which differs to the previous response schema of the discovery_run endpoint:

Before:
```json
{
  "links": [],
  "domainType": "background_job",
  "id": "12345",
  "title": "Data Processing Job",
  "members": {},
  "extensions": {
    "status": {
      "state": "running",
      "logs": {
        "progress": [
            "Job started at 2025-02-19 10:00:00"
        ],
        "result": []
      }
    },
    "active": true
  }
}
```

After:
```json
{
  "links": [],
  "domainType": "background_job",
  "id": "12345",
  "title": "Data Processing Job",
  "members": {},
  "extensions": {
      "status": {
          "state": "running",
          "log_info": {
              "JobProgressUpdate": [
                  "Job started at 2025-02-19 10:00:00"
              ],
              "JobResult": [],
              "JobException": []
          }
      },
      "active": true
  }
}
```

Allowing to request multiple jobs also means that there is no limit on how many jobs can be requested. It is the client's responsibility to handle the amount of jobs responsibly.
