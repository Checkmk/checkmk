Our Gerrit integration now offers the ability to cache version information for
deployed instances.

The setting defaults to 8 hours (3 times a day). We consider this a sane
default given that this information rarely changes. However, you can always
adjust this setting under: "Setup > Agents > Other integrations > Gerrit."

Caching was introduced to reduce the load put on your deployed Gerrit instance
as well as the infrastructure hosted by Gerrit. However, if you'd like to
_never_ cache, simply set the value to 0.
