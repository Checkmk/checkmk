For large sites, the alertstats view freezes before you have a chance to filter the result.

Searching with the filter must now be done explicitly for the view.
In addition, the default for the "logtime from" filter has been changed from 31 to 7 to keep the default search result smaller.

When using the alertstats view without explicitly setting "logtime from" in any dashboard, you need to set "logtime from" = 31 to keep the same behaviour as before.
