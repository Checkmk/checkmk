Title: Check logged_out on single user session mode on session init

When single user session mode was enabled, it was not possible to log in again before the session timeout expired.
This behavior was caused by ignoring the status "logged_out"=True in the session_info.mk file.

This status is now checked correctly, allowing immediate re-login without waiting for the session timeout.
