When using `omd cp` or `omd mv` to rename a site, when the site has a dynamic host configuration, the connected hosts information was not converted to new site name properly.

The configuration change is made only for the host configuration created with a Piggyback Data connector. If the connector is running in a remote site and the configuration is synchronized, then renaming the central site and/or the remote site will not fix anything.

Now running `omd cp` or `omd mv` converts the connector information properly.
