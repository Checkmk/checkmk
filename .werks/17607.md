This change affects the behaviour `omd cp` and `omd mv`, if it is called on site which is using 'Dynamic host management'.

'Dynamic host management' allows creating and updating hosts based on Piggyback data.
In the past, these hosts would no longer be updated by the dynamic host management after calling `omd cp` or `omd mv`.
Such stale hosts can be identified by looking at the 'Locked by' attribute, which will show 'Unknown site ({old site name})'.

With this Werk, the 'Locked by' attribute is updated by `omd cp` and `omd mv`. As a result the hosts will no longer be stale.
