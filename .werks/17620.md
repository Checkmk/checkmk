If e.g. a wrong secret access key was provided to the AWS agent, it would result in a crash with the error message
```
ClientError (An error occurred (SignatureDoesNotMatch) when calling the GetCallerIdentity operation: The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your AWS Secret Access Key and signing method. Consult the service documentation.)
```

Errors due to invalid credentials are now directed to the "AWS Exceptions" service instead as with other errors that occur when accessing AWS and require user attention.
