With the release of rabbitmq v4.0.01 several I/O related metrics are no longer made available by rabbitmq, among others `sockets_used` and `sockets_total`.
Previously a default value of `0` being returned for these values lead to a crash of the check plugin with a `ZeroDivisionError`.
Now the service will no longer be discovered.
