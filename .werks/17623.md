For certain Netapp ONTAP versions, the method to calculate the cpu utilization changed.

Instead of
```
(statistics.processor_utilization_raw/statistics.processor_utilization_base)*100
```
the calculation becomes
```
(delta(statistics.processor_utilization_raw)/delta(statistics.processor_utilization_base))*100
```
According to CONTAP-377586, the affected versions are 9.15.1 to 9.15.1P9 and 9.16.1 to 9.16.1P2.

Since now at least two datapoints are needed for the calculation, the service might become stale while waiting for valid data to come in if you are using one of these versions.
