Title: Discovery check failed to recognise changed services

This only affects users that have the "_Periodic service discovery_" rule configred to "_Automatically update service configuration_" *and* set the mode to "_Refresh all services and host labels (tabula rasa)_".

With this setting it is expected that not only new services are added and vanished ones are removed, but also changed service properties (discovered parameters and service labels) are updated.

While the autodiscovery was doing this correctly, the periodic service discovery check failed to trigger the autodiscovery in case there where only changed services (but no new or vanished ones).
