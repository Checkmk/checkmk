This change might be incompatible for users that rely on the possibility to install (enable *and* activate) outdated MKPs from the _"Extension packages"_ page of the GUI.
This will only be possible from the commandline from now on.

All MKPs specify a minimal Checkmk version they require, and they may specify a Checkmk version that they are not supposed to be used with anymore.

With this change the handling of the Checkmk version requirements of an MKP is made consistent and a little bit more strict.
From the _"Extension packages"_ page, you can only install (enable and *activate*) MKPs whos version requirements are fulfilled.
Other MKPs are only enabled, but not installed (an appropriate error is shown).

The `enable` command of the commandline interface will behave the same.
In addition, on the commandline users can specify `--force-install`, in which case the MKP will be enabled and activated regardless of *any* of its version requirements.
