This is only incompatible for users relying on the presence of the metrics in the RRDs, for example in the configration for the integration with InfluxDB.

The metric `mem_total` is not longer produced directly by the plugin "Usage of Physical and Virtual RAM".
It is instead computed from the other available metrics.
We introduced this change in Checkmk 2.3 as an optimization as the metric was redundant.
This did not affect Checkmks internal monitoring.

However:
It can cause issues for external integrations relying on the metric being present, such as the integration with InfluxDB.
