This fixes a crash in case a livestatus query times out during computations of predictive levels.
The displayed error was `MKLivestatusSocketError (Unhandled exception: Checker for <MyHost> clutest2 timed out after 60 seconds)`.

This case is now handled gracefully, and we retry in the next check cycle.
