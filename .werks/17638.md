This only affects the 2.4 beta versions.

Users that removed SNMP sections after updating to a 2.4 beta version have experienced the following warning during the update:

```
WARNING: Invalid rule configuration detected
Ruleset: snmp_check_interval
Title: Fetch intervals for SNMP sections
```

This is caused by [Werk #15359](https://checkmk.com/werk/15359) in particular, but could also be caused by removed MKPs, for example.
The warning can safely be ignored.
