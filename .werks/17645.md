In previous versions the contact group was assigned to the "Provider" customer, which would make
the group only available on sites assigned to the "Provider". At the same time there is a rule to
assign all hosts to this contact group, which would also apply on all customer sites. Leading to an
inconsistent configuration where a rule assigns hosts to a contact group which does not exist.

To resolve this inconsistency the customer field of this group is now set to "global".
