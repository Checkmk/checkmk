Users who are allowed to managed MKPs will be notified of deprecated plug-ins through a
notification in the UI which is indicated by a small red bubble on the "User" menu.

We are now introducing this mechanism to make users of extension packages that no longer work with
2.4 aware of the incompatibility in advance so that they can migrate or update their installed
extension packages before the update to 2.4.
