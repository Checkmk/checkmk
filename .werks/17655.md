Docker networks and related containers are inventorized below the network name as a sub tree. The
network names may contain spaces which are not allowed in inventory paths and break the inventory
of docker node networks and related containers.
Now the networks are re-organized as a table below the static inventory path
"Software - Applications - Docker networks" and the containers are stored below
"Software - Applications - Docker networks - Containers" as a table, too.
