Graph templates that are implemented against `cmk.graphing.v1` consist of compound or simple
lines. A line is classified as scalar (ie. `WarningOf`, `CriticalOf`, `MinimumOf`, `MaximumOf`
 and `Constant`) or a metric. Compound objects (eg. `Sum`, `Product`) that are only built from
scalars are classified as scalars.

Scalars are displayed in a separate area below a graph.
