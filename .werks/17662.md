There are analyze configuration tests which are categorized as deprecations tests, eg.
`Broken GUI extensions`, `Deprecated check plug-ins (legacy)`, `Deprecated check plug-ins (v1)`
or `Deprecated HW/SW Inventory plug-ins`.

If such a deprecation is found then a message will be sent to users which are allowed to manage
MKPs or are allowed to configure rules in case of deprecated rule sets.

If a message is deleted it will be sent again if the underlying problem is not solved.
