In werk #15515 the deprecation of the old HTTP monitoring plug-in was
announced for Checkmk 2.4.0 release. The deprecation has been postponed
until the 2.5.0 release. This will allow more time to migrate to the new
plug-in ruleset.

All other statements remain true as of Checkmk 2.5.0:

- The plug-in file is still shipped with Checkmk and can be accessed with
  the generic rule set for active checks.
- No new rules can be created in the deprecated rule set; all existing rules
  will still be used.

This werk is considered incompatible. Migration to the new plug-in must be
done before the 2.5.0 release, as it cannot be rolled back after that.
