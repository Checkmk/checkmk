The title "Linux bonding interface status" has been used twice for two
similar but different rule sets. Now the rule set for Open vSwitch
thresholds is unique again.

As all existing rules remain the same and only the representation on UI is
changed this fix is considered as compatible.

The unique name is now: Open vSwitch bonding interface status.
