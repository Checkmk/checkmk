The option Allow self-signed certificates now ignores three certificate errors:
X509_V_ERR_DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT, X509_V_ERR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN, and
X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY. These errors typically occur with
self-signed certificates.

As a result, when this option is enabled, Checkmk will no longer report validation
errors for these specific cases, allowing users to connect to services using self-signed
certificates without issues. No user action is required to benefit from this improvement.
