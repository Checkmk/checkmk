If you are currently using the deprecated Microsoft SQL Server ruleset, you must migrate to the new plugin and its Agent Bakery ruleset named "Microsoft SQL Server (Linux, Windows)" before upgrading to Checkmk 2.6.0. You can no longer add new rules to the deprecated ruleset.

The new plugin and its Agent Bakery ruleset provide continued support and access to new features. 

The old ruleset will remain available in Checkmk 2.5.0, and all previously configured rules will continue to function without interruption to allow a smooth transition. However, this old ruleset and its Agent Bakery ruleset will be removed in the next major release following Checkmk 2.5.0.
