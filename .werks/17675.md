As of this werk, the Windows version of the Robotmk scheduler shipped with Checkmk is compiled with
less libraries linked dynamically. This increases compatibility across different Windows versions.

In case the scheduler is deployed to an incompatible system, it crashes upon startup and no Robotmk
services are discovered on the affected host.
