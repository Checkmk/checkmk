The graphing API offers the option to use the minimum and maximum value of a metric in graph
definitions. As of this werk, these two elements are prefixed with "Minimum of" / "Maximum of" in
the graph legend and mouse hover. Before, the legend and the mouse hover displayed such elements
with the title of the underlying metric only.
