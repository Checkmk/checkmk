The new daemon `automation-helper` was introduced to speed up various UI interactions, such as
service discoveries. The speed-up heavily depends on the size of the Checkmk site. For example, for
small sites, activating pending changes will be substantially faster than before, whereas in large
setups, the difference might be less noticeable.

Per default, the `automation-helper` daemon is active both for newly created and for updated sites.
It can however be deactivated in the OMD configuration menu in the "Basic" settings sub-menu. This
is intended mainly for error diagnosis: If the `automation-helper` daemon is suspected to cause an
error, this suspicion can be verified by deactivating it and re-checking if the error goes away.

When active, the new daemon stores logged messages in various files located in
`var/log/automation-helper`.
