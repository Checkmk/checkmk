The agent plugin `mk_sshd_config` monitors the SSH daemon configuration based on the output of
`sshd -T`. On Ubuntu 24.04 (and possibly also other systems), `sshd -T` only succeeds after the
first incoming SSH session. Before, the command fails with
```
$ sudo sshd -T
Missing privilege separation directory: /run/sshd
```

To solve this issue, `mk_sshd_config` now implements a fallback to `sshd -G` in case `sshd -T`
fails. Note that `sshd -G` cannot fully replace `sshd -T`, since the `-G` option is not available on
all platforms.
