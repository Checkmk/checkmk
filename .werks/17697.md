For a better understanding what's going on with your notifications in Checkmk,
we introduce the new "Notification overview".

This overview is shown on top of the "Setup" - "Notifications" page and
contains the following elements:

***Failed notifications***

Shows the number of failed notifications and indicates with an icon if anything
is okay or if notifications have failed.

***Total sent notifications***

Helps you to put the “Failed notifications” number into context. Links to
"Notifications of host & services" filtered for the last 7 days to take a
closer look at what notifications were sent.

***Core status of notifications***

Shows on how many Checkmk sites notifications are enabled. If they are disabled
on a site via, e.g. “Master control”, then the site name shows up so that you
can ensure this was a deliberate action.

***Optimize notifications***

Rules that help you with optimizing the number of notifications you are receiving.

***Supporting rules***

Rules that help you to set up a scalable notification system.

The whole section can be expanded or collapsed, so if you are only interested
in the global notification rules, you don’t get distracted.
