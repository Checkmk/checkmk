To modernize the look and feel of our HTML Emails, we now use a Jinja2
template. The template is divided into three parts:

* Summary: a short overview of the event, host, and service name
* Event overview: details related to the event, i.e. date, host address, site, and service details
* Graph: a visualization of host or service (when available)

As before, you are still able to configure additional options in the HTML Email
parameter. For better usability, these options are now divided into different
sections:

**Settings**

* URL prefix for links to Checkmk
* Enable synchronous delivery via SMTP (only CEE/CME)

**Email header**

* Custom sender ("From") _(2.3: "From")_
* Custom recipient of "Reply to" _(2.3: "Reply to")
* Hide other recipients: Send individual notifications to each recipient _(2.3: "Send separate notifications to every recipient")_
* Subject line for host notifications _(2.3: "Subject for host notifications")_
* Subject line for service notifications _(2.3: "Subject for service notifications")_

**Email body/content**

* Custom HTML section _(2.3: "Add HTML section above table")_
* Additional details _(2.3: "Display additional information")_
* Show contact groups _(new)_
* Show service labels _(new)_
* Show host labels _(new)_
* Show host tags _(new)_
* Number of graphs per notification _(2.3: "Graphs per notification")_

**Troubleshooting/testing settings**

* Show notification rule that triggered the notification _(new)_

**Bulk notifications**

* Notification sort order for bulk notifications
* Limit number of events with graphs per bulk notification _(2.3: "Bulk notifications with graphs")_

No action is needed for old HTML Email notification rules.
