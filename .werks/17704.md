If you do not use Jira notifications in the Event Console or the "Test
notification" feature, you are not affected of this werk.

Creating Jira notifications with the Event Console or via test notifications,
lead to failed executions of the script because the problem ID was in a string
format instead of an integer.

As we suggested to create the custom fields with type "Number" in Jira, this kind
of notification are not compatible with these instructions.

If you want to use the mentioned ways of creating a notification with the Jira
notification method, please convert the custom problem ID fields in Jira from
type "Number" to type "Text". As Jira as of today has no way to convert
existing fields to a new type, you would have to delete the old fields and
create new ones.

Our instruction will be updated to suggest a number field for future
configurations. The notification script will now exit with an error that
suggests the change to a text field.
