The entry "Logging of the notification mechanics" available in e.g. the
"Related" dropdown menu on the notifications Setup page is an enterprise
feature. If you used this option in the CRE, an error like "The global setting
"cmc_debug_notifications" does not exist" was shown.

Now the option is grayed out in CRE with a tooltip showing that this is an
enterprise feature.
