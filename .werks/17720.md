Try and fetch the `uname` information via `uname -X`. In the event that the GNU
`uname` is found on the path, fallback to full path call to `/usr/bin/uname`,
the binary which we expect to found on all Solaris systems.

If that binary is not found for whatever reason, no section output will be
written to the agent output.
