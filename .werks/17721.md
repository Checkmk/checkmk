Currently, the plugin displays available minor/patch versions that are downgrades to the current
major version.

Concretely, if the current version is `3.11.1`, the check offers `2.16.28` as a possible minor
upgrade. This makes little sense as admins will rarely want to downgrade from their current version
to a lower major version. It's better to only display available versions that are greater than
the current semantic version. In the case for a current version of `3.11.1`, that would be `4.0.0`,
`3.12.0` or `3.11.2`.

This fix changes this behavior, and there is no change required by the user.
