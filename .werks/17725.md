This change affects users of the rule 'Check HTTP service (deprecated)', which is used to configure the HTTP monitoring plug-in.
The rule was superseded by the introduction of `check_httpv2`, see [Werk #17665](https://checkmk.com/werk/17665).

With this Werk, a new command-line tool is introduced.
This tool helps to migrate between the old and the new rule set.
It can be invoked as follows:
```sh
OMD[mysite]:~$ cmk-migrate-http -h
```

Note, this change does not affect `cmk-update-config` nor `omd update` in any way.
Existing rules are only affected if the tool is explicitely invoked.
The existing deprecated rules can also be migrated manually.
