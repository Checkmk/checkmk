This change affects users of the rule 'Check HTTP service (deprecated)', which is used to configure the HTTP monitoring plug-in.

With this Werk, a new command-line tool is introduced. It can be invoked as follows:
```sh
OMD[mysite]:~$ cmk-migrate-http migrate -h
```

Note, this change does not affect `cmk-update-config` or `omd update` in any way.
Existing rules are only affected if the tool is explicitely called.
