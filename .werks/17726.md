Previously, the rule 'Microsoft Azure' would ignore any value set via 'Import tags as host/service labels'.
This regression was introduced in the 2.3.0b4.
Moreover, after removing the option and saving the rule, then the option would be automatically be added again.
This behaviour has been present since its introduction, i.e., the 2.3.0b1.

With this Werk, a new option 'Filter tags imported as host/service labels' is introduced.
This Werk does not affect hosts in existing setups.
This is because the default of the new rule always matches the behaviour of old configuration, which couldn't be changed.
