The option 'Import tags as host/service labels' for the rule 'Microsoft Azure' did not behave as desired.
Checkmk would always import all Azure tags irrespective of what was configured.
This regression was introduced in the 2.3.0b4.
Moreover, after removing the option and saving the rule, then the option would be automatically be added again.
This behaviour has been present since its introduction, i.e., the 2.3.0b1.

With this Werk, the reworked option 'Filter Azure tags imported as host/service labels' is introduced.
As before, the default rule imports all tags.
However, it is now also possible to filter tags.

This Werk does not affect existing setups.
