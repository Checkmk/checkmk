Checkmk keeps track of unacknowledged Werks per site.
During an update to a new major version these Werks are automatically acknowledged and the list of unacknowledged Werks is replaced with the ones of the new version.
Due to this behaviour, `omd update` warns users before the update if there are any unacknowledged Werks.

In particular, updating Checkmk on the virtual appliance could result in the following traceback:
```
cmk.exceptions.MKGeneralException: Cannot execute omd command omd -f -V 2.4.0b1.cee update --conflict=install server: Cleaning up tmp directory...#033)0#033[1;24r#033[m#017#033[4l#033[?7h#033[?1000h#033[39;49m#033[39;49m#033[m#017#033[H#033[J#033[0;10;1m#017#033[37m#033[47m
```

With this Werk, `omd update` with `--conflict install` or `--conflict keepold` will no longer prompt the user about whether to proceed with the update.
The unacknowledged Werks are displayed as part of the update log.
With the option `--conflict abort` the update will be aborted.
