Previously, the command `omd -V {version} update` did not work correctly, if `{version}` matched the version of the site.
This a user error, since the site cannot be updated if it already has the target version.
In this case, `omd` would open the TUI and ask the user to pick a different version.
This infinite loop would only stop once the user selected 'Abort'.

With this Werk, `omd` will immediately exit with an appropriate error message.
