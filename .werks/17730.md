The script `cmk-migrate-http` can be used to migrate `check_http` rules to `check_httpv2` rules in an automated fashion.

Multiple changes have been made to improve the useability of the script.
None of these changes affect the actual migration of rules.

* The option `--http-1-0-not-supported=ignore` is now selected automatically.
  This option would warn you, if the old check was in a configuration, in which
  it would send HTTP/1.0 requests. The requests are now silently changed to
  HTTP/1.1. Per RFC7230,  HTTP/1.1 is compatible with HTTP/1.0.
* The script no longer validates against the usage of macros. With the
  introduction of [Werk #17584](https://checkmk.com/werk/17584) this validation is obsolete.
* Introduction of the `--dry-run` option.
* Update of multiple texts.
* Addition of summaries for the commands `delete`, `activate`, and `deactivate`.
* Addition of service name in rule header.
