Checkmk keeps track of unacknowledged Werks per site.
During an update to a new major version these Werks are automatically acknowledged and the list of unacknowledged Werks is replaced with the ones of the new version.
Due to this behaviour, `omd update` warns users before the update if there are any unacknowledged Werks.

With this Werk, the update warning only applies on the central site. Previously, it only applied on remote sites.
