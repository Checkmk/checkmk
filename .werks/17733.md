This Werk only affects users of the 2.4 beta (e.g., 2.4.0b5), and whom have installed the agent plug-in `smart_posix`.
These users must rediscover their services.

With this change, the new SMART services use the model together with the serial
number as an item. The following plugins are affected:

* `smart_ata_temp`
* `smart_ata_stats`
* `smart_nvme_temp`
* `smart_nvme_stats`
* `smart_scsi_temp`

These plug-ins require the `smart_posix` plug-in to be deployed.
