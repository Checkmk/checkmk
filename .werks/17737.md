The script `cmk-migrate-http` can be used to migrate `check_http` rules to `check_httpv2` rules in an automated fashion.

The old plug-in `check_http` allowed configuring SSL, but it would not check the validity of the certificate.
Moreover, the plug-in always used the host address as the host name unless overwritten via `Virtual host`.
If the certificate is validated, this configuration will cause certificate errors.

This change aims to remedy this problem.
With this Werk, the migration script will use `$HOSTADDRESS$` in place of the `$HOSTNAME$` in the URL, which will fend off certificate errors due to the wrong hostname.
A prerequisite to benefit from this change is that the corresponding host configurations contain the correct host name.
