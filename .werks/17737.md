The script `cmk-migrate-http` can be used to migrate `check_http` rules to `check_httpv2` rules in an automated fashion.

The old plug-in `check_http` allowed configuring SSL, but it would not check the validity of the certificate.
Moreover, the plug-in always used the host address as the host name unless overwritten via `Virtual host`.
If the certificate is validated, this configuration will cause certificate errors.

This change aims to remedy this problem and makes the following changes.

* The migration script will use `$HOSTADDRESS$` in place of the `$HOSTNAME$` in the URL, which will fend off certificate errors due to the wrong hostname. A prerequisite to benefit from this change is that the corresponding host configurations contain the correct host name.
* A new option `--v2-checks-certificates` is introduced. This option allows disabling certificate validation during migration. This affects rules using the `Check the URL` mode.
* A new option `--cant-ignore-certificate-validation` is introduced. This option allows skipping migration of rules using the `Check SSL Certificate Age` mode.
