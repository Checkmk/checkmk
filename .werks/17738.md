The deprecated plug-in `check_http` allows to match values such as
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
302 REDIRECT
404
```
against the request target via the option 'Strings to expect in server response'.
The new plug-in `check_http2` only allows checking the status code.
Previously, the script `cmk-migrate-http` would turn all three of these values into the status codes 200, 302 and 404.

With this Werk, only the value `404` will be migrated. The other values cause the `--only-status-codes-allowed` conflict.
