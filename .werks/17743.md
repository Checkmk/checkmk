The check plug-in `azure_resource_health` would sometimes show 'Item not found in monitoring data', despite the information being available.
This was because special agent `agent_azure` would only query the first of the page of the corresponding endpoint `providers/Microsoft.ResourceHealth/availabilityStatuses`.
