The check plug-in `prism_hosts` would alert if the status of the Acropolis connection to the hypervisor was `kDisconnected`.
Moreover, it would omit all other information including the host state.
With this Werk, the alerting is configurable via `Nutanix Host State` and check plug-in shows the information.
