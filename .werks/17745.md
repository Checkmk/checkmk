Configuring the threshold for packet rates in interfaces was inconsistent, as it did not allow to define percentiles for "Non-unicast packet rates".

Now "Non-unicast packet rates" offers the same configuration options as all other packet rates configuration, being able to define a relative or an absolute threshold. Old values will be migrated automatically.
