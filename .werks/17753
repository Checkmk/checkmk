Title: Fixed error handling for EC bulk commands

The event console commands "Update & acknowledge" and "Change state" can be
done for multiple events at once via checkboxes. If an error happened during
the processing, events after that were not processed further. This has been
fixed: Processing continues after an error now, but you can still see all
errors in the event console log.
