Checkmk 2.0.0p31 introduced a regression regarding the loading of old (pre
1.6.0) Event Console history files, leading to IndexError exceptions. This
has been fixed.

Note that sites which have been successfully upgraded to Checkmk 2.4 are not
affected, as the Event Console history is in a different format (SQLite DB)
then.
