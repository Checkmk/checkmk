The commands `cmk --dump-cmc-state` and `cmk --dump-cmc-config` allow users
to view the current state and configuration of the Checkmk Microcore (CMC).
Previously, these commands only worked when executed from the root directory
of the site.

Now, they can be run from any directory, making it easier and faster to
access this information without needing to change directories.
