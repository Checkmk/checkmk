## Description
Added cookie invalidation mechanism to the vSphere special agent. Cookies older than 4 hours are now automatically invalidated, forcing a new login and cookie generation. This helps prevent issues with stale or expired authentication sessions. The agent continues to work as before.

Previously, the agent would only check if cookies exist but not their age, which could lead to authentication issues when the agent is scheduled to run infrequently (e.g., once or twice daily). Now, cookies are automatically invalidated after 4 hours, which matches vSphere's typical session timeout settings.

## Effects
- More reliable authentication with vSphere systems
- No configuration changes required from users
