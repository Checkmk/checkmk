If there was a service level defined in the service_levels rule, that contained a "-" sign in the description, the update failed with an error similar to:
```
File "/omd/sites/klapplg_240b1/lib/python3.12/site-packages/cmk/rulesets/v1/form_specs/_composed.py", line 22, in _validate_name
    raise ValueError(f"'{name}' is not a valid, non-reserved Python identifier")
ValueError: 'test_-_bronze' is not a valid, non-reserved Python identifier
```
This has now been fixed and the update will go through without problems.
