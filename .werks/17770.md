When _'provisioned_ReadCapacityUnits'_ and/or _'provisioned_WriteCapacityUnits'_ were provided in the agent output, parsing failed with the following error:

**Parsing of section aws_dynamodb_table failed**

This has now been fixed, so the presence of the above metrics will no longer cause the parsing to crash.
