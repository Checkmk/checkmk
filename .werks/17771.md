**Description:**
This update improves the handling of negative values reported by ESX systems in datastore metrics.
Previously, negative values could cause unexpected behavior or crashes.
With this change, negative values are now gracefully skipped.

**Impact:**
- Negative values in metrics like latency or throughput are ignored.

**Compatibility:**
This change is backward-compatible and does not affect existing configurations.

**Action Required:**
No manual action is required. The update will automatically handle negative values during metric processing.
