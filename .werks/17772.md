Previously, the Cisco QoS check could incorrectly report interface speeds for interfaces with a speed value of "4294967295" (which indicates high-speed interfaces).
The check now uses the correct high-speed value from the SNMP table and uses it to determine the actual interface speed in bits per second.
This ensures accurate bandwidth calculations for high-speed interfaces.
