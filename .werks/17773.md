The aws_lambda_performance check now handles cases where the values for the "Invocations" metric are missing.
Previously, missing invocation data would cause parsing errors, such as:
```
TypeError (LambdaCloudwatchMetrics.__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'Invocations')
```

With this change, the check treats missing values as zero, ensuring that the check output remains consistent
and does not fail when AWS does not report invocation metrics for unused Lambda functions.
