Previously, vServers with the entity type **loadbalancing group** were discovered and included in the check results. These servers do not report a status, which could cause the check to return a CRIT state incorrectly. Since "loadbalancing group" entries represent only configuration objects on the device and not actual vServers, they should not influence monitoring results.

With this werk, vServers of type **loadbalancing group** are no longer discovered and do not affect the check state.

If you have services discovered for "loadbalancing group" vServers, these services will become stale after this update.
To resolve this, please perform a service discovery on the affected hosts.
