Previously, the cmciii_io check would incorrectly report a CRIT state for relay
outputs when the status was "Off". This was due to special-case logic that
treated relay devices differently from other I/O ports.

The check has been simplified to consistently apply the same state mapping to
all I/O devices:
- "OK", "Off", and "Closed" states map to OK
- "On" and "Open" states map to WARN
- Unknown states default to WARN

This fix ensures that relay outputs with "Off" status now correctly report OK
state instead of CRIT, aligning the behavior with the documented checkman
specification.
