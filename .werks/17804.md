This Werk is only applicable for plugin developers and adds the registration of
`Topic.Virtualization` to the rulespec_group_registry, so the topic is usable in RuleSets.

Due to the forgotten registration, the `Topic.VIRTUALIZATION` would lead to crashes
during the indexing of the search function in CheckMK,
therefor essentially disabling it, when used for a RuleSet  in API v1.
