When configuring the URL for check_httpv2, an IPv6 address should
be wrapped within square brackets, for example

https://[::1]

However, if you were to use a macro within the URL, and wrapped
the macro in square brackets, it would not be parsed correctly
and would generate a crash report. For example

https://[$HOSTNAME$]


With this werk, we now avoid the crash and display a user-friendly
warning message on saving.
