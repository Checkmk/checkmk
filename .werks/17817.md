In previous versions of Checkmk, when attempting to login with
an invalid userid, a profile directory was created <a href="https://checkmk.com/werk/16389">(Werk #16389)</a>.
However, this could cause problems when updating to 2.2, as these
profile directory names could contain invalid characters.
This werk addresses this issues by first deleting any invalid user
profile from disk that isn't also a valid Checkmk user.
