In the rule search, only the "Used rulesets" button was ever offered as a suggestion.

Now the other two buttons are displayed depending on the selected search:

- Search "Used rulesets": Suggestion Buttons "Deprecated rules" & "Ineffective rules" are shown
- Search "Deprecated rules": Suggestion Buttons "Used rulesets" & "Ineffective rules" are shown
- Search "Ineffective rules": Suggestion Buttons "Used rulesets" & "Deprecated rules" are shown
