Starting in 2.4, the toner color was not shown in `supply_toner` metric. This is now supported by
migrating these metrics to `supply_toner_{black|cyan|magenta|yellow}` if a color is found.
Otherwise, the `supply_toner_other` metric will be used.

**Note:** this means that history of the previous `supply_toner` metric will not be connected to the
new color metric history. However, you will still see its history in the respective service's
detailed view.

In addition, this change drops the `pages` metric as it's not related to the data derived from the
SNMP data. The readability of labels for the existing results and metrics were also improved,
removing any redundant information.
