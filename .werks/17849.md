If you used the option "Show popup message" for user messages and the "User"
menu already showed a hint with the count of received user messages, the hint
disappeared.

From now on, already existing hints will not be removed any more.

If you use the option "Show hint in the 'User' menu" and "Show popup message",
a hint will be shown and the user message can be found on the "Your messages"
page ("User" - "Received messages").
