Similarly to the special agents for AWS and Azure, the GCP special agent now accepts the option '--connection-test' to test the connection with given credentials.

This new option is used in the GCP Quick Setup to fail early (on stage one) if the connection attempt was unsuccessful and to provide users with an according error message.
