With this Werk we ensure that a user has all permissions that are needed to delete a given Quick Setup instance including all related objects before starting the actual deletion process.


Prior to this change, normal monitoring users with permissions "Write access to all passwords" and "Manage dynamic configuration" were able to delete any Quick Setup which was created by an admin user.
This is fixed to allowing only admin users to delete Quick Setup instances which were created by an admin user.

In case the admin user who created a Quick Setup does not exist anymore, the above deletion attempt only succeeds if the normal monitoring user has all related permissions - e.g. write access to the folder that was configured for the Quick Setup instance.
