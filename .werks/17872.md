The arrangement of UI elements in "VMware ESX via vSphere" such that
the kind of information to be retrieved is listed directly under the
type of query.

The possible values for "Type of query" have been changed to
distinguish between standalone hosts and hosts integrated in a vCenter.

Depending on the selected "Type of query" the checkboxes for the
information to be retrieved are pre-selected differently.

None of these changes require manual interaction. Existing configurations
will be migrated automatically.
