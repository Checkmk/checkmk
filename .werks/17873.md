Prior to this werk, both the free and total size of blobspace were
calculated based on the same system default page size. This caused
incorrect reporting of free/used space.

Now, the free blobspace is correctly calculated with the chosen
blobpage size.

To benefit from this change, the mk_informix plugin should be
installed with this new change.
