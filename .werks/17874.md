VM templates were treated like virtual machines in Checkmk
and appeared in the monitoring always in WARNING state.

With this change, templates are explicitly listed as such and always
in state OK.

Subsequently, the ruleset "_ESX hosts: distribution of virtual machines_"
applies to both virtual machines and templates.

This was also asked for in the 
[ideas portal](https://ideas.checkmk.com/suggestions/448538/vmware-skip-vm-templates) 
and discussed in the [forum](https://forum.checkmk.com/t/query-vcenter-how-to-suppress-template-vms/20911/2).

To take advantage of this change, services need to be rediscovered.
