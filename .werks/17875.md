If the proxy server configuration provided to the AWS agent was incorrect, it would result in a crash with the error message
```
botocore.exceptions.ProxyConnectionError: Failed to connect to proxy URL: "<url>"
```
Similar to [werk #17620](https://checkmk.com/werk/17620), this error is now directed to the "AWS Exceptions" service.
