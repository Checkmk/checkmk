This change is relevant for plugin developers using the `custom_validate` option for `Levels` and `SimpleLevels`.

Previously, validation functions defined via `SimpleLevels.custom_validate` and `Levels.custom_validate` were not executed, resulting in no validation for levels specified with Ruleset API v1.
`custom_validate` functions defined for FormSpecs in the `form_spec_template` field worked as intended, however.

No shipped rules are affected by this.
