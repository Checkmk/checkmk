Previously the piggyback-hub could only be dis-/enabled via OMD CLI, which made configuring it in distributed setups cumbersome.
The configuration is now also possible in the UI under
```
Setup > General > Global settings > Enable piggyback hub
```
or the equivalent option in the site connection.

The configuration via UI is strongly encouraged, changes made via the omd config CLI may be overwritten by changes made in the web interface.
