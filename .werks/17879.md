This werk is relevant if you want to use the distributed piggyback mechanism.

The piggyback-hub of the central site needs to be enabled if any site in the
distributed setup wants to use distributed piggybacking, irrelevant of the fact
whether the central site is involved in the distribution.
Previously this was attempted to be done automatically, but to avoid unnecessary
complications users will have to provide the correct configuration themselves.
Any configuration made via the web interface as introduced
in [werk #17877](https://checkmk.com/werk/17877) will now be validated to that
effect.
