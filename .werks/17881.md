This werk is relevant for users using MICROSENS G6 and Cisco Catalyst 9200L switches.

When using a version containing the changes made in [werk #17786](https://checkmk.com/werk/17786) users will encounter warnings such as
```
check_mk: ERROR: Duplicate service description (auto check) '<interface>' for host '<host>'! - 1st occurrence: check plug-in / item: if64 / '<item>' - 2nd occurrence: check plug-in / item: interfaces / '<item>'
```

With this werk the duplicated services will no longer receive data, causing the Check_MK service to report WARN with the message
```
Missing monitoring data for plugins
```
To get rid of these warnings a new service discovery should be run and the vanished interface services be removed.
