Drives that experience failure may report certain values as `null` via the Redfish API.
If the reported capacity is affected, this led to a crash in the "Drive" service:
```
TypeError (unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'NoneType' and 'int')
```

Now the `null` capacity values are treated the same as completely missing capacity: The reported drive size is 0GB.
