Support diagnostics data collection now requires selecting the site from which to collect data before choosing what to gather. Previously, the log, config, licensing, and core file lists were created only on the central site. As a result, files present exclusively on remote sites were neither listed nor collected.

With this change, you must first select the remote site to collect support diagnostics data from. The files listed for collection will then correspond to the selected remote site. This improvement enables you to collect support diagnostics data from remote sites, including files that were previously inaccessible.
