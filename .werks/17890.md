Prior to this werk, `cmk-agent-ctl` reported
```
error: Invalid value for '--server <server>': Failed to split into server and port at ':'
```
when attempting to pass an IPv6 address to the `--server` argument. As of this werk, IPv6 addresses
are supported. Note that they must be enclosed in square brackets. Examples:

* `[3a02:87b0:504::2]`
* `[3a02:87b0:504::2]:8000`

As a further improvement, `cmk-agent-ctl` now performs additional validation on the value of the
`--server` argument. Before, only the port number was validated (if specified). Now, `cmk-agent-ctl`
additionally validates the IP address or hostname. Note that this additional validation is fully
compatible, since an invalid value anyway lead to an error later on when attempting to contact the
Checkmk server using an invalid hostname or IP address.
