Checkmk 2.4 did not allow for empty values in the _Ident of the value_ field in the _Siemens PLC
(SPS)_ rule, while this was still possible in Checkmk 2.3. In case of an empty value, the update
process failed with
```
-| WARNING: Invalid rule configuration detected
-| Ruleset: special_agents:siemens_plc
-| Title: Siemens PLC (SPS)
-| Folder: ...
-| Rule nr: ...
-| Exception: An identifier must only consist of letters, digits, dash and underscore and it must start with a letter or underscore.
-|
-| You can abort the update process (A) or continue (c) the update. Abort update? [A/c]
```
As of this werk, empty values are accepted also in Checkmk 2.4.
