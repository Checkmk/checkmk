Combined graphs are the graphs that are rendered via the _All metrics of same type in one graph_
option in the _Hosts_ or _Services_ dropdown menus. When attempting to add such a graph to a
dashboard via the graph dropdown menu, the Checkmk UI might have crashed with an internal error.

Note that once this error has been triggered for a dashboard, this dashboard will keep on displaying
the error whenever its contents are rendered. As a workaround, users can delete and recreate the
dashboard.
