The _Check types_ option under _Filter for hosts/services_ (Stage 2) used to be under the
_General filters_ drop-down. It has now been moved to the more appropriate _Service filters_
drop-down since check types are related to services.

There is nothing to do from a user's perspective as the existing rules will be migrated to the new
structure. Only be aware of the new location of the check types configuration.
