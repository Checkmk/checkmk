During a change to an aggregation configuration or core configuration, the
aggregation tree must be recompiled. Before we were doing this sequentially,
whereas now, we are compiling the individual aggregations disk in parallel.

There is nothing to be done from the user's perspective. However, be aware that
the compilation will use a maximum of 8 cores to process the aggregations.
If your CPU has fewer cores, it will calculate how many processes can be started
with respect to the available memory on the machine.
