When activating the single directory deployment via the ruleset _Customize agent package (Linux)_,
parts of the agent updater were unable to initialize logging.<br>
That is, running the agent updater didn't log to `/opt/checkmk/agent/default/runtime/cmk-update-agent.log`.
Affected were the minutely systemd timer that checks for a pending installation, and manual executions
of `/opt/checkmk/agent/default/package/bin/cmk-update-agent`.

All invocations of the agent updater now write log messages correctly.
