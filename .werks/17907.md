This Werk fixes a regression that occurs since Checkmk 2.4.0p1.

When deploying the Linux agent in single directory deployment by activating the ruleset
_Customize agent package (Linux)_, the agent controller won't be able to start after
agent installation or update.<br>
This only happens in root deployment - Non-root deployment is not affected.

As a result, the agent port won't be provided and the host can't be monitored.

The agent updater is not affected, so you can fix the installation with an (automatic)
agent update.
