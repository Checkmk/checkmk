This Werk fixes a regression that got introduced with Checkmk 2.4.0b1 and Werk #16713.

Werk #16713 introduced a new data storage format for host tag conditions, but the agent deployment logic on the Checkmk site missed to handle it correctly.
As a result, the agent updater failed to update agents as soon as any host tag condition was active.

Since this check happens on the Checkmk server side, no agent reinstallation is necessary.
