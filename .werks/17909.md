When setting the bakery rule _Customize agent package_, you can optionally set/overwrite
the `TMPDIR` environment variable in the scope of the agent.

Previously, this settng was not applied correctly, leaving the `TMPDIR` variable untouched
on the target system.

This Werk is marked as incompatible because you have to update/reinstall the Checkmk agent
on affected systems to apply the fix.
