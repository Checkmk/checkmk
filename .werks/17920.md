Checkmk registers a cronjob to regularly test the configuration for
deprecations and notifies the responsible users.

This job has the side-effect of clearing user messages which are not
valid anymore (their configured expiration date has passed).

This message cleanup caused the cronjob to crash, reporting a crash
report.

In this Werk we fix the underlying cause for the crash allowing the
cronjob to continue.
