When adding a new notification rule, one can filter notifications by
hosts. This filter selection suggested monitored hosts while editing.

This filter selection did not query livestatus but parsed the current
configuration to suggest existing hosts.

With this werk, we change the datasource to livestatus resulting in a
more performant host suggesting when editing these filters.
