The Ciena 5164 is a router designed to interoperate between 5G networks and the fiber networks
that connect them to the wired Internet.
SAOS 10 is a newer revision of the operating system that runs the 5164, with a redesigned/
reimplemented SNMP stack.

The Ciena 5164 returns '.1.3.6.1.2.1.25.3.1.9' as the OID identifier for its storage partitions,
even though they should not be identified as "flash" memory.
This causes the HW/SW inventory to crash when run on this device.

Now this OID is set to "None" to prevent crashing on inventorying those devices.
