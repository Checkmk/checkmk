For the Aruba 6100 switch series, no temperature was discovered and
checked.

The support for this device series now has been added.

The device defines the thresholds for low and high temperature by itself
and jumps immediately from OK to CRIT.
When the sensor emits 'fault' status, a WARN state is set.

The check uses the arubaWiredTempSensorEntry-MIB.
