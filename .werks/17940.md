The command `cmk --convert-rrds` (2.3) / `cmk-convert-rrds` (2.4+) can be used to migrate
recorded performance data from the Nagios to the CMC format after updating from the raw to a
commercial Checkmk edition. Prior to this werk, this command was disfunctional for this use case.
After executing the command, the Checkmk UI displayed metrics with titles that consisted of a single
letter only (next to the correct metrics).
