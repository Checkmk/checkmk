GCP Quick Setup Integration introduces an alternative configuration method for setting up GCP monitoring
in Checkmk. This new framework consolidates all required configuration objects onto a single page and guides
users through each step of the setup process. It implements immediate on-page validation to verify required
elements such as authentication credentials, allowing issues to be resolved immediately instead of being
detected post-configuration. Upon completion, Checkmk automatically configures the configuration objects
(host, folder, password, dynamic host management, and GCP rule), bundling them together using the configuration_bundle
object. This bundling mechanism prevents individual components from being deleted separately which would
otherwise lead to a partial configuration breakage.
