Services created by the management board host property were not checked anymore. This is now fixed.

If this affects you, you are using the strongly discouraged practice of defining the management board as a host property, rather than a dedicated host.
The feature to monitor management boards jointly with a host via the Management board attribute in the host properties will be deprecated in a future version of Checkmk. Please monitor management boards via a dedicated host using Redfish, IPMI or SNMP
