This _might_ be incompatible for plugin developers with custom tooling.
In Checkmk 2.5 we removed the symlinks `~mySite/lib/check_mk` and `~mySite/local/lib/check_mk`.
They were pointing to `~mySite/lib/python3/cmk` and `~mySite/local/lib/python3/cmk`, respectively.

The intention of these symlinks was to provide a layer of abstraction and hence stability for users.
However, in the past they have repeatedly lead to inconsistencies and confusion.
The links are removed, and users will be presented with the actual file locations henceforth.
All files stay where they have been before, we just change how they are presented to the users in some cases (for example the _Extension packages_ page).
