As of this werk, Checkmk has enhanced the sanitization of crash reports to further protect user's
from potentially exposing sensitive information. In particular, senstive information related to
security such as passwords and authentication tokens.

Additionally, if Checkmk has performed such an action and a user is reviewing their crash report
via `Monitor > SystemCrash > reports > Crash report:<UUID>`. The user will now be prompted with a
warning to perform an additional manual review.
