The jar\_signature agent plugin (configured by the _"Signatures of certificates in JAR files"_ bakery rule) prepends `JAVA_HOME/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable. A user with write permission to that directory could replace legitimate commands with their own malicious scripts and execute them as root.
