The Python runtime environment used by the Checkmk Windows Agent has been proactively updated from version 3.12 to 3.13.

This update ensures the Windows agent is running on a fully supported Python branch, addressing potential long-term maintenance and security risks associated with upstream dependencies no longer receiving updates.
