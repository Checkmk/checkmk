Title: Fixed umlauts and HTML tags in exception texts

Previous versions allowed HTML codes to be used in texts of exceptions to give the
error messages some kind of markup. This was removed to prevent XSS attacks. Now
we changed the code to only allow special markup tags like `<tt>`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<br>`.

So if you saw these tags in error messages in previous version, they should be
fixed now.

Additionally, when you used the Web GUI localized, for example in German language,
you might have had problems with umlauts in error messages. This has been fixed
and cleaned up.
