This werk introduces a validation mechanism for configuration files. Configuration
file content can change under various conditions such as accidential changes from individual
functions, leading to errors when features load configuration files with content or structure
diverging from internal expectations. The new configuration validation mechanism enables users to
independently verify content outside any product context. This mechanism is integrated into
the update actions flow and warns users of discrepancies between expected and actual content
without interrupting the update process. The mechanism can also be invoked manually via the 
`cmk-validate-config` command.

Included files for validation:
- roles
- groups (both locations)
- passwords
- notifications
- tags
- sites
- broker_connections
- user_connections
- users
- contacts
- configuration_bundles
- connections
- timeperiods
- rules (outer format)
