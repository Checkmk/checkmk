vsphere: Fix options for displaying power states

In version 2.4.0, the default value in the configuration for the following options was changed:

* "_Display ESX Host power state on_"
* "_Display VM power state additionally on_" 

However, the special agent did not accept this new value leading to a critical result in the "_Check_MK_" service complaining about an invalid choice.

This change adds the new value as a valid choice.
