This werk adds the possibility to monitor NetApp root aggregates.

By design, the NetApp REST API does not return information about root aggregates
(see: https://kb.netapp.com/on-prem/ontap/DM/REST-API/REST_API_KBs/Why_do_root_aggregates_not_show_up_in_REST_API_calls).

We now use the CLI passthrough mechanism provided by the REST API
to retrieve the UUIDs of all aggregates, including root aggregates.

A discovery is needed to start monitoring the root aggregates.
