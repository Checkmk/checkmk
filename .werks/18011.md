This werk adds the possibility to monitor NetApp root volumes.

By design, the NetApp REST API does not return information about root volumes
(see werk 18010 for a similar behavior for root aggregates).

We now use the CLI passthrough mechanism provided by the REST API
to retrieve the UUIDs of root volumes.

A discovery is needed to start monitoring the root volumes.
