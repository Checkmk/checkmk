The special agent crashed when monitoring sensors in a state other than `normal`
because they did not report the `value` field:

```
  File "/omd/sites/site_name/lib/python3/cmk/special_agents/agent_netapp_ontap.py", line 720, in fetch_environment
    value=element_data["value"],
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^
KeyError: 'value'(!!)
```

From this werk, any sensor with a status other than `normal` will have the service in CRIT status
and the specific api-reported state will be displayed in the service summary.
