The Nutanix Prism agent crashed if a connection timeout occurred with:

```
File "/omd/sites/site_name/lib/python3.12/site-packages/requests/adapters.py", line 713, in send
raise ReadTimeout(e, request=request)
requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='10.254.254.10', port=9440): Read timed out. (read timeout=10)CRIT
```

As of this change, when a timeout is reached the Check_MK service will instead go CRIT
and display a user-friendly message in the GUI.
