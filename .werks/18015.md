As of this werk, the ruleset _Fortinet FortiMail CPU load_ offers the option to explicitly configure
no upper thresholds on the CPU load (which is also the default configuration).

Furthermore, this change also fixes two very similar display errors in the UI:
1. Displaying the default check parameters via the _Display_ dropdown menu in the service discovery
page failed with an _Invalid check parameter_ error for services of the plugin `fortimail_cpu_load`.
2. Displaying the default check parameters via the _Parameters for this service_ option in the
service dropdown menu also failed with _Invalid parameter_.
