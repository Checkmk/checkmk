Previously, all recorded Robot Framework logs (`C:\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\robotmk_output\working\plans`) were removed when the Robotmk scheduler (re-)started, for example after an agent update.
As of this werk, the logs of currently configured plans are no longer removed on startup.
As before, they are removed according to the _Cleanup of working directory_ setting.
The logs of plans that are not configured anymore are completely removed on startup, as before.
