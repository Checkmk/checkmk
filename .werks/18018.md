Scalars such as constants or WARN and CRIT tresholds that were specified in the lower part of a bidirectional graph were actually rendered in the upper part.
This affected for example the bandwidth graph displayed in the interface service. Upper thresholds on the outgoing bandwidth were rendered in the upper part of the graph, which shows the input bandwidth.
