The check plugin crashed with the error

```
  File "/omd/sites/site_name/lib/python3/cmk/base/plugins/agent_based/docker_container_status.py", line 183, in check_docker_container_status_health
    last_log = health.get("Log", [{}])[-1]
```

This happened because the `Log` field in Docker's health check status can be an empty list ("Log": [])
when a health check is defined but has not yet produced any results -
 this can typically occur during the initial startup period.
