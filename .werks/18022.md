The check plugin crashed with the error:

```
  File "/omd/sites/hpc/lib/python3/cmk/base/plugins/agent_based/multipath.py", line 213, in check_multipath
    num_active / num_paths * 100.0,
  ZeroDivisionError (division by zero)
```

This issue occurred when no paths were found in the output of the `multipath -l` command.
The command’s output is influenced by the verbosity level,
which is defined in the `multipath.conf` file and typically defaults to level 2.
If this verbosity level is set to a lower value,
the command may not display all available paths, potentially also causing the check plugin to crash.

To address this, we now explicitly invoke `multipath -l -v2` within the agent.

This werk is considered incompatible because the agent must be re-deployed
to utilize the updated command.
