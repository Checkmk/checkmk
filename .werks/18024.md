This werk affects users who monitor shelf components
(fans, temperature sensors, and power supply units) in NetApp systems.

Starting from this werk, these components will only be monitored if their respective
"installed" flag is set to True.

Please note that some earlier versions of the NetApp REST API
did not provide the "installed" information for certain components.
In such cases - when the API does not return a value for the "installed" field -
the component will be assumed to be installed by default, as a safer approach,
and will therefore be monitored.

This werk is flagged as incompatible because a rediscovery is needed
to update the list of monitored components.

The affected plugins are:

- netapp_ontap_fan
- netapp_ontap_fan_summary
- netapp_ontap_psu
- netapp_ontap_psu_summary
- netapp_ontap_temp
