The check plugin crashed with the error

```
    File "/omd/sites/site_name/share/check_mk/checks/veeam_client", line 125, in check_veeam_client
     infotexts.append(f"Last backup: {render.timespan(age)} ago{label}{levels}")
  File "/omd/sites/site_name/lib/python3.12/site-packages/cmk/agent_based/v1/render.py", line 109, in timespan
     ts = " ".join(_gen_timespan_chunks(float(seconds), nchunks=2))
  File "/omd/sites/site_name/lib/python3.12/site-packages/cmk/agent_based/v1/render.py", line 75, in _gen_timespan_chunks
     raise ValueError("Cannot render negative timespan")
```

due to a discrepancy between the backup times and the current time calculated by the check plugin.
With the current werk, the agent plugin directly computes the time difference using consistent timestamps.

The werk is flagged as incompatible,
because you have to redeploy the agent plugin in order to apply this feature.
