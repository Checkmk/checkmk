If an ESX host or vCenter cannot obtain data for a metric, this lack of data is indicated by the value "-1". Without handling such values they caused a ValueError in the check plugin.

For individual datastores, the check rsult is simply set to UNKNOWN.

For the datastore summary, such items are excluded from the aggregation.
