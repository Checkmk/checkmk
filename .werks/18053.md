With this werk the configuration for the Open Telemetry collector gets extended such that incoming log messages on the OTLP endpoints can optionally be forwarded to the event console.

Be advised, this feature can put serious load on Checkmk.
Please consider the warning message in the configuration dialog and impact on your system before activating this feature.
