If users had selected sections that have since been removed or are temporarily unavailable (due to disabled MKPs for instance), they would be prompted with a message like

```
WARNING: Invalid rule configuration detected
Ruleset: snmp_exclude_sections
Title: Disabled or enabled sections (SNMP)
Folder: main
Rule nr: 1
Exception: ... is not an allowed value
```

These invalid values are ignored now.
They do no harm and they are dropped upon editing the rule.
