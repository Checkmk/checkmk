Previously, the parsing of section cisco_asa_conn crashed if an IP address,
which didn't belong to any network device, was part of the SNMP section.

This werk ensures that any standalone IP address lacking a corresponding
network device will be reported as unknown state with the additional
hint "No network device associated".
