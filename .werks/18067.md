The UIs configuration options `users`, `admin_users`, `guest_users` and
`default_user_role` are removed with this change. They were left overs from the
very early days of the Checkmk UI. Todays environments, which are typically
configured through the Setup UI or the REST API, should not make use of these
configuration options as they can not be configured this way.

In case you should have set such configuration options in your site, please
remove the options from your configuration. The roles of users are nowadays
configured through the user configuration and the default roles are set through
the `default_user_profile` option.
