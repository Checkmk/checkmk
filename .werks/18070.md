The lists of views, dashboards and reports in "Customize" were limited up to
100 rows by default.  The list of builtin views already exceeds this limit,
showing a warning message to all users opening this page. Such a limit might
make sense in other places, but in this context it does not help. So the limit
has been removed now.
