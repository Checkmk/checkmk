Title: SMS (using modem API): Use new API endpoint for TRB140 if needed
Class: fix
Compatible: incomp
Component: notifications

Level: 1
Version: 2.2.0p45

Since firmware Version 7.14 the notification script produced an error on
sending notifications.
This was caused by a change in the API specs from this firmware version on.

The script now tries to send the SMS in the previous way. If it fails, the new
API endpoint with token authentication is used.
This means that also firmware versions below 7.14 are still supported by the
notitication script.

If you use firmware version 7.14 or higher, the user for sending notifications
needs at least a group with permissions:

LI: "Write action": "Allow"
LI: "Write Access": "Services > Mobile Utilities > Messages"
LI: "Read action": "Allow"
LI: "Read access": "Services > Mobile Utilities > Messages".
