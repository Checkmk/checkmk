If you cloned e.g. the view "Event history of host" (ec_history_of_host) and
opened the link "Event history of host" in the page menu dropdown "Host" of a
host, the view showed unexpected events.

The reason was, that the filter "Host name of event (exact match)" was not
applied.

This has been fixed.
