If you configured a notification rule with "Host events" and "Service events"
with option "Event Console alerts" unchecked, Event Console alerts still
matched the rule.

Event Console alerts will now match only if this option is selected in the
notification rule configuration.

Note:
If you do not use "Event Console alert filters" in the "Filter for
hosts/services" section, all Event Console alerts will match.
