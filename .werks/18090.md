The “See user …” permission is intended to control access to user-specific
customizations.

Previously, if a user was missing such a permission (e.g., “See user topics”),
access to built-in topics was also denied.

Built-in pages now remain accessible even if the corresponding
“See user …” permission is missing — as long as the permission for the specific
built-in page itself has been granted.
