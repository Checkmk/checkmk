The Graylog special agent now exits with a non-zero status when the Graylog API is unreachable. This causes the CheckMK Agent service to report a CRIT state,
ensuring users are notified of connectivity issues. Previously, the agent exited with code 0 regardless of API availability, leading to false-positive OK states
even when Graylog was down.
