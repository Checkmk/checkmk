Starting with AOS version 6.10, the v2 API endpoint /ha returns a 500 error if the cluster contains any non-AHV hypervisors. To prevent the special agent from failing in such cases, this update adds a pre-check using the /hosts endpoint to ensure that all clusters are composed entirely of AHV hypervisors before querying /ha.
