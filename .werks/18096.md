With Werk #18094, the Nutanix Prism special agent was updated to skip HA (High Availability) monitoring on clusters that are not exclusively using the Nutanix Acropolis Hypervisor (AHV). Since AHV hypervisors are based on KVM and identify as such, the special agent effectively skipped HA monitoring on those setups. This fix adds HA monitoring to hypervisors identifying as KVM-based to restore the original state.
