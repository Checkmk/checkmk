The special agent for the ALLNET IP Sensoric XML API previously swallowed
errors silently when fetching data, causing failures to go unnoticed. With this
change, the special agent now exits with an error code and displays the
corresponding error message as part of the Check_MK service. As a result,
operators will be promptly alerted to connectivity or API issues and can take
corrective action. No configuration changes are required, but users should
monitor the Check_MK service status for such errors.
