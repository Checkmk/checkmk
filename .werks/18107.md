Previously, status lines for local checks required exactly one space between each of the four components: status, service name, performance data, and status detail.
With this werk, multiple spaces are accepted as well.

Additionally, if a line cannot be parsed correctly, it will no longer be silently skipped. Instead, a service will be created with the problematic line number as service name and the relevant error message as status detail.
