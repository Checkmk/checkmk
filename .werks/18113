This werk resolves a problem with incomplete output from the Windows agent
<code>mk_inventory</code> plugin.
Previously, the <code>mk_inventory</code> plugin used the null character (<code>ASCII 0</code>)
as a field separator, which could cause the plugin execution to stop and only
partial data to be delivered.
As a fix, the separator was changed to the Unit Separator (<code>ASCII 31</code>),
which prevents this issue.
