Prior to this change, the compiled and frozen aggregations were stored to disk
using the aggregation ID and branch title as file names. This was problematic
for some systems since the file name was truncated after a certain length. This
led to missing aggregations when running service discovery.

To fix this, we are now using a hashing algorithm to store the compiled
and frozen aggregations. This ensures that the file name length will never
exceed the file system's limit.

In addition, a migration script will run during update that will clear
the compiled aggregations and migrate the legacy frozen aggregations to the new
format.
