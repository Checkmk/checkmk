This Werk introduces the ability to filter on service states in the monitoring
Quicksearch. You can do this by specifying the `st:` prefix in the input field,
e.g. `st: crit`. On enter, you will now only see services with the `CRIT` state.

The following filters are now supported: `ok`, `warn`, `crit`, `unkn`, `pend`
