We use the aggregation and branch titles as unique identifiers. This has lead to
issues when the name is larger than the file system's limit (usually 255
characters).

This werk addresses this issue with some validation during the compilation step.
An error message will now be shown when an identifier exceeds the character
limit. There is nothing for a user to do except to be aware that they should
avoid using long identifiers.

*Note*: this restriction will be resolved in Checkmk 2.4 and later versions. See
the related [werk](https://checkmk.com/werk/18116) which addresses this issue by
introducing identifier hashing.
