After the changes made in [Werk #17836](https://checkmk.com/werk/17836), some
additional legacy code needed to be removed to support tag options when there is
only one choice available.

This may have created rules with the null value set, which is not supported
anymore. Therefore, running `cmk-update-config` is needed to run post update.
This will remove the null tag from existing rules.
