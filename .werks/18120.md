When removing a site from distributed monitoring, an error could arise saying
that hosts and folders still exist associated with a given site. The error
message offered a link to the host search which makes it easy to handle dangling
hosts, but there was no help for deleting folders. In order to clean up these
dangling folders, on would needed to manually do this via the command line.

With this change, we are now offering links to all related folders along with a
link to automatically delete these folders if said folders are empty. The flow
is constructed in such a way that a user will only see this action if all hosts
related to a site have been cleaned up and all nested hosts and folders
_unrelated to the site_ are cleaned up. That way all folders should be empty
when you are presented with this option.

Otherwise, the user must manually clean up the hosts and sub-folders nested
inside a site folder before proceeding. Use the folder links provided by the
error output to streamline this process.
