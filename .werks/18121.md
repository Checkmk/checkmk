When creating a new time period under Setup > General > Time Periods >
Add Time Period, the form is pre-filled with 00:00–24:00 for all
weekdays.

This is also the case when importing an iCalendar.

This default behavior could lead to confusing results when adding a time
period with an "Exception (from weekdays)". For example, during an
import, the pre-filled 00:00–24:00 causes the imported calendar days to
be treated as exceptions to the default — effectively inverting the
calendar.

With this update, we have removed the 00:00–24:00 prefill entirely. Now,
all configurations must be defined explicitly.
