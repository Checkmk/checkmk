We check the validity of regular expressions in input fields. For the
DCD, QuickSetup and Notification pages, this validation is currently
skipped.

With this werk we fix this bug, re-introducing validation of regular
expressions on these pages.

If you saved an distributed monitoring connection with an invalid
regular expression using any 2.4 version prior to this werk, the DCD
will crash. You can fix this by editing the regular expression in the
connection in the UI.
