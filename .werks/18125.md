We make a product distinction between event handlers and alert handlers
(see Werk #8275). In the "Checkmk site performance and settings" rule,
there is the option to set the monitoring state when these handlers are
disabled.

This rule refered to them as "event handler", which in the enterprise
edition should read "alert handler". Now the name lists both names to
avoid confusion.
