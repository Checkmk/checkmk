Some problems in the activate changes page might cause a crash which is
not properly displayed in the GUI. Instead, the GUI would only show
"Unknown activation process: {id} not found".

This occured for example when activating a faulty extension package.

In this werk, we fix this problem. Those errors are now properly
displaying the crash report on the activate changes page.
