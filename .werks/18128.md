On any 2.4.0 version, the option to exclude specific namespaces from
monitoring in the kubernetes special agent did not exclude namespaces
from the monitoring.

With this werk, the option will again exclude the matching namespaces as
expected.

**Incompatibility Hint**

If you have entered any namespaces to be excluded in Setup > Agents >
VM, cloud, container > Kubernetes > "Monitor namespaces", they will
vanish from your monitoring after applying this werk.
