The "Postfix: Mailqueue Length" check would check the queue of the
`postconf` mail agent. If `postconf` is not installed, we fall back to
`ssmtp`

With this werk, on FreeBSD systems, we will now additionally fall back
on `dma` to check if there are mails queued if both `postconf` and
`ssmtp` are not available.

We thank the Github user felixjogris for the pull request which formed
the basis for this change.
