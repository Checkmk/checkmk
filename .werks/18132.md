When updating Checkmk, the config validation would fail with a message
similar to the following when validating valid time periods created by
importing a calendar:

```
The following mk files had issues during the validation:

    etc/check_mk/conf.d/wato/timeperiods.mk..................... Failed
    Invalid timeperiods:
    ['<time_period_name>: Missing time periods']
```

With this Werk, we adapt the validation to no longer complain for these
valid time periods
