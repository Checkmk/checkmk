When configuring a redfish compatible management controller (Setup >
Agents > Other integrations > Redfish Compatible Management Controller),
the agent will crash if the redfish API is not reachable within the
allowed time.

The crash report will show "RetriesExhaustedError".

With this werk, exceeding the retries/timeout will render the service
critical instead.

You can configure the timeout and number of retries in the rule.
