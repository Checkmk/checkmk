When upgrading to Checkmk 2.5, the update process might raise the
following exception in the ruleset validation that certain site
selections are not valid:

Site to register with: The value 'sitename' has type str, but does not
match any of the available choice types.

This error could be safely ignored by continuing.

With this Werk, we update the configuration to allow the upgrade to 2.5
to have all the informations it needs such that the warning no longer
occurs.
