Disabled services from active or custom checks that were disabled via
the "Disabled services" or "Disabled checks" rules would not appear in
the service discovery.

This werk fixes a bug that previously hid the categories "Disabled
active checks" and "Disabled custom checks - defined via rule", causing
these disabled services to be missing from the page.

The disabled services will now show in their respective categories.

No further action is required for this fix.
