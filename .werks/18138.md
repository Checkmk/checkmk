A recent update of Chrome to version 142 changed the way select boxes
are being rendered.

This broke the styling of various multiple-select form fields like the
"Permission" selection when editing a host or when selecting files to
create an MKP from.

With this werk, the appearance of these select fields have been restored
to what they looked like before version 142.
