With this change, the new SMART services have labels.
The following plugins are affected:

* `smart_ata_temp`
* `smart_ata_stats`
* `smart_nvme_temp`
* `smart_nvme_stats`
* `smart_scsi_temp`

The new service labels are:

* `cmk/smart/type` - the device type reported by `smartctl`, see `-d TYPE` in the `smartctl` help
* `cmk/smart/device` - the device name as passed to `smartctl --json --all <device>`
* `cmk/smart/model` - the model as seen in the item
* `cmk/smart/serial` - the serial number as seen in the item

These plug-ins require the `smart_posix` plug-in to be deployed.
Additionally, you must rediscover to benefit from this change.
