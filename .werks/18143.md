Previously, invoking an UNIX agent while enabling `DISABLE_CACHING` did not work properly.
For instance, the invocation `DISABLE_CACHING='true' check_mk_agent.linux` would result in agent output such as:

```
'<<<chrony>>>'; waitmax 5 chronyc -n tracking | cat || true
```

The agents will now run the commands instead of printing them.
This regression was introduced in [Werk #12906](https://checkmk.com/werk/12906).
Thank you Artem Sidorenko for this contribution.
