Previously, the `omd` service `crontab` would raise an exception, if the site user did not have access to `crontab`.
```
Starting crontab...You (site2) are not allowed to use this program (crontab)
See crontab(1) for more information
Exception ignored in: <_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stdout>' mode='w' encoding='utf-8'>
BrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
failed
```
This exception was harmless, but has been fixed nonetheless.
The new output looks like this:
```
Starting crontab...You (site2) are not allowed to use this program (crontab)
See crontab(1) for more information
failed
```
