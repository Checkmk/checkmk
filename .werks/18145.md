The command `omd create <SITE>` will create the user `<SITE>` and the group `<SITE>`.
Previously, the group created by `omd` was not a system group.
With this Werk, this has been fixed.

## Background

The site user is always created as a system user, since `omd` invokes this command:
```sh
useradd -r -d '<SITE>' -c 'OMD site <SITE>' -g <SITE> -G omd <SITE> -s /bin/bash
```
In particular, the user identifier is chosen in the `SYS_UID_MIN-SYS_UID_MAX` range, defined in `/etc/login.defs`.
`omd` will now invoke
```sh
groupadd -r '<SITE>'
```
whereas it previously invoked
```sh
groupadd '<SITE>'
```
This means the group identifier will be chosen in the `SYS_GID_MIN-SYS_GID_MAX` instead of `GID_MIN-GID_MAX` on a freshly created site.

Note, that this Werk leaves existing groups unchanged and we recommend to be very cautious of changing a `GID`.
If you opt to do so anyway, be aware that it is unsufficient to invoke `groupmod` by itself.
At the very minimum, you must also:

* Restart all existing processes with the old `GID`.
* Update the `GID` of all files and directories. Note, that `chgrp` will also clear  `suid` and `sgid` flags, which need to be restored afterwards.
* If you have archives, such as the one created by `omd backup`, it will contain the old `GID`.
* Double check `/etc/passwd`, which won't be updated by `groupmod` according to some sources.
