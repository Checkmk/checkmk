With this Werk, `omd create` will emit different exit codes based on errors it encountered:

0 -> Site creation was successful.
1 -> An exception occured and the site creation was aborted.
2 -> An issue was detected that requires manual intervention to resolve.

Currently, the exit code 2 case is only triggered when a site user is unable to access `crontab`, which is required for a site to work properly.
