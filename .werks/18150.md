Previously, the check plug-in `db2_counters` would crash with the following error:
```
  File "/omd/sites/prod/share/check_mk/checks/db2_counters", line 60, in parse_db2_counters
    timestamp = int(line[1])
```
if Perl was not installed on the monitored host.
With this Werk, the check plug-in will now mention the missing install.
