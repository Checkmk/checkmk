Previously, the parsing of section `smart_posix_all` could fail with
```
ValidationError (25 validation errors for ParseSection
NVMeAll.device.protocol
  Input should be 'NVMe' [type=literal_error, input_value='ATA', input_type=str]
    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.10/v/literal_error
ATAAll.ata_smart_attributes.table.0.thresh
```
The crash was caused by a missing threshold.
This threshold was used to check the `Reallocated Events` (id 196).
With this Werk, the crash no longer occurs.
The check on `Reallocated Events` is omitted if the threshold is missing.
You can still configure thresholds manually via the rule `SMART ATA (incompatible with legacy plug-in)`.
