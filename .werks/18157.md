The special agent `special_redfish` queries storage-related endpoints to collect data on volumes and drives.

Some devices return empty id references in the `VolumeCollection` and `DriveCollection`.
When this occurs, the agent encounters a `KeyError: '@odata.id'`.
As a result, monitoring data from the agent is missing.

This update fixes the issue by ignoring id references that lack an id, preventing the `KeyError` and ensuring the agent continues to collect data as expected.

Thanks to Andreas DÃ¶hler for the contribution.
