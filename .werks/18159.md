The `omd` command has an undocumented feature, which can be invoked as follows.
```
$ omd --interactive version
 [yes/NO]: No
Aborted.
```
This feature was intended for users new to Checkmk.
However, it never offered more than the `[yes/NO]` dialog seen above.
In practice, this command wasted the time of users, who discovered it.

This Werk removes the option `--interactive`.
