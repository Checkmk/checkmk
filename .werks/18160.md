The command `omd update` provides the suppression of confirmation dialogs via the `--conflict` flag.
This flag is passed to `cmk-update-config`.

However, an important use-case was not covered by `omd update`:
If you have a backup, you might want to ignore all errors and ensure that the update would not be aborted by `omd`.
Even if passing `--conflict=install`, some update actions can abort the update.

An update with the option `--conflict=ignore` will now always continue upon detecting a conflict.
