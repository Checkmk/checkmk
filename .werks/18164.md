When monitoring large Proxmox clusters, the special agent could run into timeouts fetching all backup logs.
Especially after a monitoring host restart or upgrade. This was due to the cache being stored in tmpfs,
requiring all logs to be refetched after a restart.
This could be mitigated by reducing the "Maximum Log Age" or adjusting the agent’s timeout settings.

With this update, the backup log cache is now persisted on disk instead of tmpfs.
As a result, after restarting or upgrading the Checkmk monitoring host,
the agent does not need to refetch all backup logs — only new logs are retrieved,
improving performance and reducing the likelihood of timeouts with default settings.

If you encountered timeouts with the Proxmox special agent,
you can manually run `cmk HOSTNAME` on the monitoring host shell to rerun the checks without timeout.
Subsequent checks will then use the persistent cache and only fetch new logs.
If you have had no problems, no action is needed.
