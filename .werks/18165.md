This werk introduces the ability to monitor multiple metrics per service within
the service monitoring rule for open telemetry.

Previously monitoring rules could only be defined for the *first* metric detected in a service.
Prior to (Werk #18209)[https://checkmk.com/werk/18209], rules could only be applied if *exactly one* metric was available for the service.

With this change rulesets allow you to specify a *list* of metric names.
You can now monitor several metrics in the same service, each with its own thresholds or levels.
