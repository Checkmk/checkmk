When creating rules for specific metric names in OTel rulesets,
the plugin would crash if not all rules were selected and defined.

This werk makes the parameters "rate computation", "levels lower" and "levels upper" mandatory
while providing default values that were implicitely assumed before.

This way default values are clearly shown to the user and documented properly.
