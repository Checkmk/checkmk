This Werk adds an autocomplete field to the metric name field in the OTel rule.
When selecting to define rules for specific metrics,
the metric name field will now recommend all known otel metrics.
Alternatively a unknown metric name can be provided.

The metric name recommendation will only work if metrics are already monitored.
