This werk improves the service monitoring rule for the otel service,
to make setting up otel monitoring rules easier and clearer.

* Make the top level option mandatory and don't show a checkbox
* Remove the top level title and change the choice labels to better describe the choices
* Remove the "monotonic counter" choice from the specific metric rate calculation metric.
  "Don't calculate a rate" is the new default and will be applied if "monotonic counter" was selected before.
