Previously we would only consider the latest received resource metric dataset during checking.
Not all producers will send the complete set of datapoints in every resource metric dataset.
This would lead to services flapping or the status UNKNOWN.

With this Werk metrics will now be merged before checking, as to consider all datapoints.
