When using the new smart check for (S)ATA drives, the power on hours could be displayed incorrectly.

The new behavior relies on a value provided by smartctl. Therefore the check plugin no longer shows
power on hours if smartctl is not able to interpret the raw value.

This should only apply to really new disks and can most likely be fixed by updating the smartctl drive database:
