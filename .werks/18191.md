When saving the Network interfaces and switch ports rule and either
selecting "Operating speed" or "Operational state" the value would
not be saved.

Unfortunately, this error also breaks the existing rules if upgrading
to a version without this fix. You will need to manually restore the values
for these two fields in the rule.
