Parsing of the section `docker_container_diskstat_cgroupv2` crashed when the
subsection `[names]` contained a line with only a device name (without a device
number), e.g.:

```
[names]
nvme0c0n1
```

instead of the expected:

```
[names]
nvme0n1 259:1
```

The following error was raised:

```
self.names[line[1]] = line[0]
               ~~~~^^^
IndexError: list index out of range
```

This issue has been fixed by skipping such corrupt output lines.
