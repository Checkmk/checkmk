When saving a new or existing _Disk IO discovery_ rule, if the _Create a separate check for each physical disk_ value was not enabled then all of the other values (summary, LVM, etc) would be set to enabled after saving.

This fix restores the correct behavior no matter whether _Create a separate check for each physical disk_ is enabled or not.

If no _Disk IO discovery_ rule was added to your site or if you enabled the _Create a separate check for each physical disk_ flag on each rule, then this fix won't affect you.

Otherwise, you will have to edit your rule(s) again to fix the incorrectly saved values from before the update.
