A companion metric to _Disk backend bytes removed or overwritten_ has been added, called _Rate of disk backend bytes removed or overwritten_.

Compared to the original metric, which shows the full value, the new metric shows the change in value over time.

Thus, if the value _Disk backend bytes remoted or overwritten_ shows a value of 2MB then 2.5MB, then the value of _Rate of disk backend bytes removed or overwritten_ will be N/A then 512KB.
