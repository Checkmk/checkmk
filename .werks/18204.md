Our Bazel Cache integration now supports checking for new versions for a monitored Bazel Cache server. 

A new _service monitoring rule_ called Bazel Cache Version has been added to support this.

The new rule allows alerts to be configured if new major, minor or patch versions are available for a configured Bazel Remote Cache service.

The Bazel Remote Cache ruleset under _"Agents -> Other Integrations"_ must be configured alongside the new rule for the version.

The service summary will always show the current version and then the relevant alerts, if there are any.
