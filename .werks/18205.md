Rules for the Event Console have a setting under the _"Counting & Timing"_ section called _"Expect regular messages"_.

When this setting is enabled and an event matching the rule does not reach the Event Console, events are generated to indicate that the original event did not arrive.

However, with _"Expect regular messages"_ enabled, there were circumstances when the timestamps reported in the _"Message"_ column for the generated events were incorrect.

Specifically, if Checkmk was stopped for a long period of time or if you changed the _"Interval"_ setting of the rule without matching events being detected.

Then, the timestamp of the generated event(s) would be incorrect. 

Furthermore, checking for intervals started later than expected. 

For example, using a 5-minute interval, it would take 10 minutes for the first missing events to be reported in the very first check cycle.

With this fix, both issues are fixed and the message timestamp will always be up to date.

No changes are required and new events should have the correct timestamps.

Any older events which have incorrect timestamp messages are not modified. 

The event time should still correctly reflect the time the event was created.
