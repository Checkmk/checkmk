During the migration from 2.3.0 to 2.4.0, the storage format of the event console was migrated from a text-based format to SQLite.

However, after this process, the files were renamed to have a bak extension. 

This step was unnecessary as the data had already been successfully parsed and migrated.

Furthermore, there can be issues with disk consumption for large sites as the event data is effectively duplicated.

This change ensures old data is cleaned up once migration has finished, or clears the unused files during an upgrade.
