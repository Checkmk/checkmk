During update from **2.2.0p42** to **2.3.0p35**, the following error in the Prometheus rule occurred:

```
-| AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'strip'
-| 
-| Update aborted with Error: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'strip'.
```

This error occurred because the connection property format was changed between releases.
Previously, the connection was configured using a CascadingDropdown with tuple format,
but in newer releases it was changed to a simple string format.

The issue has been fixed by adding migration handling for the connection property to 
automatically convert existing configurations from the old tuple format to the new string 
format during the update process.
