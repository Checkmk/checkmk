If a monitored host was rebootet during the execution of a cached plugin, the
plugin was never executed again.
The same problem occured when restarting the systemd service `check-mk-agent-async`.

Affected users can manually remove the `/var/lib/check_mk_agent/cache/*.cache.new.*` files of affected plugins.

After deploying the agent shipped with this version, the situation recovers on its own.
