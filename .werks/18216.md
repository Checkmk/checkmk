**This Werk was reverted with Werk [Werk #18472](https://checkmk.com/werk/18472)**

If a monitored host was rebootet during the execution of a cached plugin, the
plugin was never executed again.
The same problem occured when restarting the systemd service `check-mk-agent-async`.

After deploying the agent shipped with this version, the situation recovers on its own.
