This fixes a bug in the special agent Proxmox VE that was unveiled in Checkmk 2.4.0p6.
The special agent would fail reporting
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/omd/sites/.../tmp/check_mk/special_agents/agent_proxmox_ve/erroneous-....log'(!!)
```

This can be mitigated by creating the missing folder:
```
OMD[MySite]:~$ mkdir -p tmp/check_mk/special_agents/agent_proxmox_ve
```
