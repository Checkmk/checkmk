Checkmk can monitor the administrative status of network interfaces via SNMP.
To configure this, users have to enable the section `ifadm64` via the ruleset _Disabled or enabled sections (SNMP)_.
For some devices, the interface services did not report the administrative status after enabling the `ifadm64` section.
This has been fixed.
