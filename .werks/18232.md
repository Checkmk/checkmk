Users reported the following error when running the update config migration:

```console
39/39 Migrate legacy frozen aggregations....
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '~/tmp/check_mk/bi_cache/compilation.LOCK'
```

This would occur when a user did not have Business Intelligence (BI) rules set.
The applied fix makes sure that the operation now never fails, especially when
BI is not in use.

The bug was introduced with the following werk: https://checkmk.com/werk/18116
