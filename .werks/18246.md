The Netapp Ontap special agent previously queried all LIFs one by one, which resulted in slower data collection and increased load on the monitored system.

This has been improved by using a bulk query to retrieve all LIFs at once, significantly enhancing performance. As a result, data collection from Netapp Ontap devices is faster, leading to quicker monitoring updates and reduced system load. No action is required from users.
