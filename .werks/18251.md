This change is relevant for users using regexes containing the "|" symbol to search for strings in the "Check HTTP web service" rule.
If such a regex was used, part of the check output looked like (incorrectly formatted) performance data, confusing other parts of Check_MK, e.g. the graphing subsystem.
This has been fixed.
