When the cluster was in a degraded state, the agent crashed because the NetApp Python package raised an exception:

    "exc_type": "NetAppRestError",
    "exc_value": "Caused by ValidationError({'state': ['\"info not available (node not reachable)\" is not one of [\\'up\\', \\'down\\', \\'degraded\\']']})",

From this werk, we are gracefully failing in case fetching ports would raise the same exception,
and we communicate to the user that the cluster is probably in a degraded state.
