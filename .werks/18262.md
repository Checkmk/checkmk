This werk impacts users monitoring the health status of Azure resources.

Previously, the service responsible for monitoring the health availability statuses of Azure resources
would transition to CRIT if a resource was reported as unavailable via the API,
regardless of the reason for unavailability.

As of this werk the service will now maintain an OK status
if a resource is reported as unavailable but the reason provided is "Customer Initiated".
