This werk impacts those who monitor NetApp ONTAP systems.

The Diagnosis Status service (netapp_ontap_status)
was critical if at least one alert was present, regardless of its suppress or acknowledge status.

This change modifies the mentioned service
to consider alerts that are either acknowledged or suppressed on the NetApp side as OK.
The service details will now also include the status of each alert
(suppressed or acknowledged, if applicable) and the name of the suppressor or acknowledger.

Credits for this change go to GitHub user @kbuettner.
