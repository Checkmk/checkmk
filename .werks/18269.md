When selecting a host under _Setup > Hosts_, you can find the _Monitoring agent_ entry under the _Host_ top menu entry.<br>
Here you can look up and download the monitoring agent package for this host for every available target platform.

Previously, this page did only show the generic agent package targeted for the host's folder, if available.<br>
If there is no generic agent package for the host's folder, the page erroneously showed the text "This host has no Checkmk agents."
