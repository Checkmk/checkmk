This Werk fixes a regression that occurs since Checkmk 2.4.0p6.

After an agent update to a Checkmk agent 2.4.0p6 or newer, the agent updater kept downloading the already installed agent after every second run.<br>
Also, the _Check_MK agent_ service on the Checkmk site showed a pending update.<br>
Other agent functionalities, including further agent updates, were not affected.<br>
However, this behavior led to a high network traffic, since every Windows host with enabled automatic updates kept downloading the agent.<br>

As a workaround, before upgrading to a Checkmk version with the fix from this Werk, you can either deactivate agent updates globally via the _Master switch_, or deactivate it explicitly for affected Windows hosts with the setting _Activate update only on the selected hosts_.

After applying the fix and baking agents (and enabling automatic updates again), the Windows agents will automatically update to the new version without the download loop.
