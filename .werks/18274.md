This Werk fixes a regression that occurs since Checkmk 2.4.0.

At the _Printer cartridge levels_ ruleset, you can enable the option _Upturn supply levels_ (Previously called _Upturn toner levels_) to fix values from a device that reports its levels in an unusual way.
This fix, while being effective for Containers like ink cartridges and toners, failed to apply for receptacles like waste boxes.

Alongside this Werk, the wording around the _Upturn supply levels_ option and the Check's manpage has been adapted slightly to clarify the scope and meaning of this feature.
