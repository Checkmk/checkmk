[Werk #17897](https://checkmk.com/werk/17897) introduced multi-core processing
when compiling aggregations. This was intended to improve performance. However,
users have reported very high system resource usage. So, it was determined to
rollback this feature and investigate the underlying issue.

The bug was introduced in the following versions:

- `2.3.0p33`
- `2.4.0p1`

We recommended updating to the next release if you were affected by this issue.
There is no user intervention necessary as the compilation occurs in the
background.
