Anywhere where you may have seen a dropdown with
proxy options, we've now renamed the options as follows

"Use from environment" is now
 -> "Auto-detect proxy settings for this network"

"Connect without proxy" is now
 -> "No proxy"

"Use globally configured proxy" is now
 -> "Globally configured proxy"

"Use explicit proxy settings" is now
 -> "Manual proxy configuration"
