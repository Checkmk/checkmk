`Global proxies` were previously configured using only three fields:

* `title`
* `ident`
* `proxy_url`

However, this configuration posed a problem because the `proxy_url` combined several components, including the username and password, into a single field.

To address this, the UI now separates each component and introduces the option to store the password securely. The new configuration structure is:

* `title`
* `ident`
* `proxy_config`
  * `scheme`
  * `proxy_server_name`
  * `port`
  * `auth`

An update action automatically migrates any existing global proxy configurations to this new format. After the update, users do not need to make manual changes, but it is recommended to verify proxy settings to ensure connectivity remains correct. This change improves security and clarity by separating username and password fields and supporting password storage options.
