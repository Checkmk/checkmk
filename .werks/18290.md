When creating notification rules via the REST-API, a new notification parameter was created each time, even if an identical parameter already existed. This led to unnecessary duplication of notification parameters.

To address this issue, the REST-API now re-uses existing notification parameters when creating new notification rules. This change reduces duplication and improves the efficiency of the notification system.

We have also added an update action that will remove any duplicate notification parameters and also update the notification rules to reference the re-used parameters.
