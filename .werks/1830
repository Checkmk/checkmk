Title: oracle_rman: added detection of INCR0/1 backups
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1427480633
Class: feature

There were problems with the old SQL in mk_oracle for the RMAN check. The result
are a lot of false alarms. This issue has been fixed with a new strategy in
selecting the data.

A positive side effect is the ability to monitor level 0+1 backups in different checks.
It is possible to monitor a weekly level 0 and daily level 1 backup with 2 different checks.

H2: Incompatible change:

This is an incompatible Change when `ORA <DB_NAME>.DB_INCR` are used in the past. The checkname
has been changed to `<DB_NAME>.DB_INCR_0` and `<DB_NAME>.DB_INCR_1` when
level 1 backups are used.

This change requires a modification of existing rules due to change names for the checks.

Please don't forget to rediscover the RMAN checks.

There is a global variable which can be used to switch to the old behavior. Details are
documented in the manpage.
