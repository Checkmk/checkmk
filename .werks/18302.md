diskstat now discovers virtual disks without World Wide Names (WWN), fixing silent discovery failures in virtual machines.

Since version 2.4.0, diskstat uses WWN as the service description for disks. However, virtual disks in some VMs do not have WWNs, causing the plugin to fail silently during service discovery and leaving those disks unmonitored.

This Werk resolves the issue by enabling diskstat to detect devices even when not a single WWN is present, ensuring that systems only with virtual disks are properly monitored.

No action is required from users, but you may notice new diskstat services appearing in your monitoring for virtual machines that previously had undetected disks.
