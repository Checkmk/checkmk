The IBM MQ plugin now supports remote Mainframe LPAR data in CSQM format, in addition to the previously supported local Mainframe LPAR data in AMQ format. This enhancement allows users to monitor Mainframe LPARs remotely via AIX systems, expanding monitoring capabilities beyond local machines.

This update fixes Werk #18301, which caused the plugin to malfunction when both AMQ and CSQM formats were included in a single agent output. With this fix, users can reliably monitor Mainframe LPARs using either format without errors.
