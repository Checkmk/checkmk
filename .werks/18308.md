The Robotmk scheduler can be configured to execute plans as specific users.
Before executing a plan as a specific user, the scheduler checks if an active session exists for this user and aborts if this is not the case.
Previously, this check was case-sensitive wrt. the username entered in the bakery rule in Checkmk.
However, Windows usernames are case-insensitive.
With this change, the scheduler also ignores the case of the username when checking for an active session.
