The OTel collector currently uses the site's tmp directory (mounted on tmpfs) to store incoming data.
The cleanup of older data did not work correctly, leading to memory filling up and not being freed.
This has been fixed.

Note that high volumes of incoming OpenTelemetry data may still cause memory to fill up faster than it can be cleaned up.
