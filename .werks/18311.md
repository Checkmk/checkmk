The certificates used by the OTel collector for TLS encryption are signed by the site CA and contain the same information as general site certificates.

The OTel collector now uses the general site certificates for TLS encryption instead of requiring separate ones. This change simplifies certificate management by eliminating the need to create and maintain distinct certificates for the OTel collector. Existing general site certificates are used automatically, reducing administrative overhead. No action is required unless you want to replace certificates, in which case you should update the general site certificates as usual.
