The OpenTelemetry collector memory limit configuration has moved from "Setup > Hosts > OpenTelemetry collector (experimental) > Memory" to "Global settings > Application monitoring > OTel collector memory" (see https://checkmk.com/werk/18181).
This option cannot be set via the REST API.
The behavior of the collector itself remains unchanged, so no further action is required.
