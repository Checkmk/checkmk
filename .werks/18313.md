Metric names for Otel datapoints, which were generated by combining the Otel metric name, its datapoint attributes and unit, previously included curly braces.
These curly braces made the metric names unusable for graphing, as graphing tools only allow characters, numbers and underscores.
With this change, all curly braces in metric names are replaced by underscores.
This ensures that Otel metric names are now fully compatible with graphing tools, allowing users to see their Otel metrics correctly displayed without errors.
The change is automatic and transparent, so no existing graphs need to be recreated.
