If no custom OpenTelemetry Collector configuration is provided, the otel service should automatically run using Checkmk’s default fallback configuration — as long as `OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR` is enabled.

Previously, if you added a custom `otel-collector` configuration (for example, defining a receiver) and then removed it, the service would stop running entirely.

With this change, the `otel-collector` service now continues to run using default fallback configuration after a custom configuration is removed.
