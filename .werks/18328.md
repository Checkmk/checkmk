The `mem_linux` check plug-in computes `MemUsed` from `MemTotal`, `MemFree` and
some other metrics. Then the related graph plug-in stacks all these metrics and
computed the `MemTotal` (which is already available as a metric from the target
host). This may be error prone when it comes to RRD consolidation (ie.  there
may be spikes when using `max`).

Now we directly use `MemTotal` in the related graph plug-in. The `MemTotal` is
the physical RAM minus a few reserved bits and the kernel binary code.
