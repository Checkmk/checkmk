To prevent excessive memory usage, the metric data exported by the OpenTelemetry collector is no longer written to the tmp directory.
Instead, it is now stored in the `var` directory.
This change helps to avoid memory pressure that can occur when using tmpfs for large data exports.

The data has been moved from:
```plaintext
<site_path>/tmp/check_mk/otel_collector/host_monitoring
```
to:

```plaintext
<site_path>/var/check_mk/otel_collector/host_monitoring
```
