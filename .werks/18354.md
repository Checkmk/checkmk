Previously, the OTEL collector configuration generation wrapped all non-IPv4 addresses in square brackets,
which caused hostnames and IPv4 addresses to be rendered in an invalid Prometheus target format (e.g. [example.com]:443).

This prevented successful scraping by the Prometheus receiver.

The generation logic has been corrected:

- IPv6 addresses are still enclosed in brackets (required syntax).
- Hostnames and IPv4 addresses are now output without brackets.

As a result, Prometheus targets in generated configs should now scrape correctly.

**User action required**

If you have an existing configuration, open the configuration in the GUI, click Save, and then Activate the changes to apply this fix.
This will regenerate the OTEL collector configuration with the corrected target format.
