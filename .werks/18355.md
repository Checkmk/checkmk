Previously, the generated OTEL collector configuration for Prometheus scrape targets defaulted to http even when connecting to endpoints on port 443 with TLS enabled.
This caused scraping failures for secure endpoints, as the collector attempted to speak plain HTTP over a TLS port.

The configuration generation has been updated to explicitly set the scheme to https for relevant targets, ensuring that TLS connections are correctly established.

As a result, Prometheus receivers in the OTEL collector can now successfully scrape metrics from HTTPS endpoints.

**User action required**

If you have an existing configuration, open the configuration in the GUI, click Save, and then Activate the changes to apply this fix.
