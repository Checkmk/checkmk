When activating an MKP that contains rules using the Password Store,
Checkmk previously displayed the error message `Exception in ruleset implementation detected` on the _"Extension Packages"_ page.
The issue was caused by a missing logged-in user in the context of the ruleset migration script `cmk-migrate-extension-rulesets`.
This has now been fixed.
