Previously, enabling the OpenTelemetry collector required leaving the UI and manually updating the site configuration via the terminal (stop site → enable collector → restart site).
This interrupted the configuration flow and created unnecessary friction for users.

With this change, a new global setting is introduced under the header "Application monitoring":
- Enable OpenTelemetry collector which toggles the OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR OMD config variable directly from the UI.

This improvement streamlines the OpenTelemetry integration setup, allowing users to enable the collector directly in the UI without leaving their configuration workflow.
