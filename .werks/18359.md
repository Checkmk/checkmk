Previously, the OpenTelemetry collector configuration combined both receiver protocols (gRPC/HTTP) and Prometheus scrape settings in a single place.
User feedback showed that this setup was confusing, as receivers and scraping serve different purposes.

We have now split the configuration into two separate entries under Setup > Hosts:

- OpenTelemetry collector: Receiver (experimental) – contains the configuration for Receiver protocol GRPC and Receiver protocol HTTP.

- OpenTelemetry collector: Prometheus scraping (experimental) – contains the configuration for Prometheus scrape configurations.

This change does not alter the behavior of the collector itself.
