Previously, the Event Console (EC) could generate pseudo events when processing log data forwarded by the site collector.
This occurred because the collector’s syslog exporter did not have octet counting enabled, preventing the EC from correctly separating individual log entries.

To fix this, the site collector’s syslog exporter now has `exporters.syslog.enable_octet_counting` set to true by default.
This ensures that only real log entries are forwarded and processed, eliminating pseudo or merged events in the EC.
