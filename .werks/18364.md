User synchronization could overwrite bookmarks and other custom views on remote sites. This issue occurred when the customer
attribute of a user was changed on the central site.

The central site failed to detect the change in the customer attribute, which led to invalid synchronization of user-specific
files.

As a result, users might notice that their saved bookmarks and custom views on remote sites are unexpectedly reset or lost
after such changes. No user action is required, as the fix addresses the synchronization process automatically.
