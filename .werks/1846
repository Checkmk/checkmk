The HW/SW-Inventory module now keeps tracks of changes of the hardware and
software on a system: Each time an inventory is being done the outcome is
being compared with the data from the last time. If a change has been detected,
a copy of the previous inventory data is being stored for later reference (in
<tt>var/check_mk/inventory_archive</tt>).  The check <tt>HW/SW Inventory</tt>
can be configured with the WATO ruleset <i>Do hardware/software Inventory</i>
to report a WARN or CRIT state if one of hardware or software has changed.

Secondly - if you are viewing details of a host - a button <i>Inventory
History</i> brings you to a new view of the historic development of the
host's hardware and software. At the beginning this button is hidden
behind the <i>[...]</i>-button (as usual). The history shows you each point
of time where at least one item of the inventory data has changed. That
way you can easily keep track of new installed software, exchanged
hard disks, BIOS updates and much more.
