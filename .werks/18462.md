In the 'systemd service summary', failed systemd services were displayed as such,
even if they had been disabled on the system or set to 'ignore' by the user.
This led to the service summary being misinterpreted according to the set state,
due to failed, but disabled or ignored, systemd services were not triggering a
CRIT state in the systemd service summary.

Now, disabled or ignored 'failed' systemd services are not counted as failed services.
