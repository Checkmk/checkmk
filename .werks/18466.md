For early versions of the Aruba 6100 series the sensor thresholds were supplied by the device.
However, starting with the 6200 series and also later Aruba 6100 firmwares, the same OIDs no longer provide the thresholds, but rather the historical min and max values.
As a result, most services for these temperature sensors were automatically set to WARN or CRIT.
Furthermore, no device lower levels will be evaluated anymore.

Explicit default values are now used.
