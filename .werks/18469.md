The "Activate Changes" button has been moved from the top right of
title bar of the main content to a separate main navigation element.
It regularly polls for new pending changes and displays the number
of changes to be activated as a badge on the menu item.

Clicking on the new menu item no longer opens the "Activate changes"
page directly. Instead, a slideout opens that allows you to activate
pending changes without leaving the current page.

You can access the "Activate Changes" page from the slideout using the
"Open Full View" button.
