Add new option "Ignore unrecognized events" to the "Use FreeIPMI" section of the
"Agents" rule "IPMI Sensors via Freeipmi or IPMItool", which will add the
`--ignore_unrecognized_events` argument to the `ipmi-sensors` invocation.

With this new option it is possible to ignore unrecognized events which would
otherwise result in a critical service state, as well as entries like
"Unrecognized Event = 0100h" in the service summary.
