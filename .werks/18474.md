You might be affected by this Werk if you use the `mk_db2` agent plugin on AIX.

`mk_db2.aix` use a login shell since [Werk #17480](https://checkmk.com/werk/17480).
This means that anything written to stdout in `/etc/profile` will be part of the
db2 sections. This of course will crash the check as the checks do not expect
random data included in their sections.

This Werk now applies some redirecting to remove the welcome message.
