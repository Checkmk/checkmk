`SELECT total_log_used from sysibmadm.snapdb` (which is used internally by
db2_logsizes) returns `"-"` when writes are suspended in db2.

The check did not consider this edgecase and crashed with `ValueError: invalid
literal for int() with base 10: '-'`. Now the check will go to `UNKNOWN` and
show `Can not read usedspace`.
