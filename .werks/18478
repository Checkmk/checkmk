Title: ibm_storage_ts_drive: handle empty string for read/write errors

A customer reported that IBM TS3100 tape library devices return an empty string
instead of the number of recovered write errors. This happens sporadically and
the correct number of recovered write errors is reported in the next check
cycle.

Prior to this werk the plugin was crashing in that situation, now the check
will return state "unknown" and the summary will indicate that it received an
empty string.
