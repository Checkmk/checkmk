Since [Werk #17967](https://checkmk.com/werk/17967) you could no longer save
server names containing macros, even if you chose 
_"unvalidated string (for use with macros)"_.

With this Werk the distinction between validated and unvalidated server has
been removed and the server name is no longer validated. This is in line with
the behaviour of Checkmk 2.4.0.
