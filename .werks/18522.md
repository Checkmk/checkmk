For the GCP Cloud Run monitoring the focus is on Cloud Run Services.
However when querying the GCP resources, Cloud Jobs were included as well, leading to a crash:
```
Parsing of section gcp_service_cloud_run failed
```
with
```
KeyError(service_name)
```
This has been fixed by querying only Cloud Run Service revisions.
