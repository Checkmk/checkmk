Since the `OTel metric` service creates Checkmk metrics from OTel datapoints without filtering or restricting them at first, this can result in a high number of metrics per service.
To ensure this number does not grow uncontrollably, the number of emitted Checkmk metrics is now restricted to `20`.

At `15` metrics, the service will go to `WARN` to inform about the upcoming restriction.
At `20` metrics, they are aggregated into one metric, per default by averaging.
The aggregation method can be configured in the "OpenTelemetry (experimental) (Managed Services Edition, Cloud Edition)" service monitoring rule.
