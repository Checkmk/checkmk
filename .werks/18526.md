Previously the option to monitor the OpenTelemetry collector itself needed to be configured in the special agent configuration.
This option has been removed, instead the collector is automatically monitored on the host representing the machine the site is running on.

Marked as incompatible since if you are currently monitoring the collector on a different host, the services will no longer receive data.
