This werk is relevant for users using the active check `check-http` and a Checkmk version that includes [werk #16681](https://checkmk.com/werk/16681).

With [werk #16681](https://checkmk.com/werk/16681) the limits for the expected response time were scaled incorrectly, leading to large values.
Additionally, the unit of the response time before werk #16681 was stated as milliseconds, while the active check expects it in seconds.
Since the configured timeout is automatically increased to match the response time limits, this results in `check-http` running for a long time without finishing.

With this werk, if you haven't updated to a version affected by werk #16681 yet, the response time limits are automatically adjusted to seconds.
If you are affected by werk #16681, you need to manually check and correct your configuration.
