When you previously enabled "Monitor the collector" in the OpenTelemetry (experimental) special agent, the collectorâ€™s own metrics were created and shown like other OpenTelemetry metrics.
Now, the collector is monitored in its own dedicated service.
Currently only the memory usage that any configured memory limits for the collector apply to is reported.
