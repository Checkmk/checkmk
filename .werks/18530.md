When the monitored system is under high load or if there is a large amount of Docker data, retrieving the node disk usage data can time out, resulting in missing monitoring data.

To mitigate this issue, there is now an option that enables the use of previously retrieved data during such timeouts. Per default, period of 90 seconds will be bridged.

If you are using a commercial edition, the period during which the previous data will be used is configurable in the rule "Setup > Agents > Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX > Agent rules > Docker node and containers" under the setting "Persistence period for node disk usage fallback."
If you use the Raw Edition, configure this setting by adding the following entry to the agent plugin configuration file:
```
persist_period_node_disk_usage: <period in seconds>
```
