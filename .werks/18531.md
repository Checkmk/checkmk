In certain scenarios, particularly those involving clustered
configurations, the `odbc` backend offers more stable and reliable
monitoring.

The backend can be selected using the GUI. For the Raw Edition,
it is also possible to configure the system manually to use the
`odbc` backend by editing the YAML configuration file.
