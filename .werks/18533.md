In some installations, certain system databases may not be accessible â€” 
for example, the `model` database can be inaccessible if Microsoft SQL 
Server is installed on AWS. Previously, this situation caused monitoring 
errors.

Starting with this release, you can configure the monitoring to ignore 
such databases. Currently, the following system databases can be excluded: 
`model`, `master`, `msdb` and `tempdb` using GUI or editing config file entry
`exclude_databases`, which represents the list of strings in config section 
`connection`.
