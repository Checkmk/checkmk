Previously, the physical MAC address of the network 
interface was reported incorrectly: instead of six 
hexadecimal values, eight were returned, with the 
last two always being zeros.

This issue has been fixed in this release.
Due to the change in reported values, rediscovery 
of certain network interface services may be required.
