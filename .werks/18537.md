Open Hardware Monitor, which provided hardware sensor data on Windows systems, has been removed from the distribution because of related Windows Defender alarms. Recently Windows Defender started to report VulnerableDriver:WinNT/Winring0.G (see CVE-2020-14979).

We're investigating if we can find a proper replacement in future release.

With this update, all Open Hardware Monitor based services will vanish. Potentially existing services, e.g. temperature services, may be reported as vanished by the discovery check. In case you don't need them urgently, you can solve this warning by removing the services in question using the service discovery.

If you want to keep using the Open Hardware Monitor based services, you may need to download binaries from our site and install it in site. As site user execute, please:
```

wget https://github.com/Checkmk/checkmk/blob/master/doc/treasures/windows/ohm/OpenHardwareMonitorLib.dll -P local/share/check_mk/agents/windows/
