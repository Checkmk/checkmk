Previously, the `ODBC` backend ignored the configuration flag
`trust_server_certificate, which made it impossible to connect to a database
when the server’s SSL certificate was invalid or untrusted.

Starting with this release, the ODBC backend correctly respects the
`trust_server_certificate` option. This allows connections to proceed even
if the server certificate cannot be validated — or, conversely, to forbid
the connection entirely if the flag is set to `false`.

Note: In Microsoft SQL Server, 'TrustServerCertificate' means whether
the client accepts the server’s SSL certificate without validation.
When set to `true`, the connection is encrypted but the certificate’s
authenticity is not verified, which may expose clients to
man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
