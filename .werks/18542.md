After activating the changes, users would occasionally observe crashes of 
special agents or active checks reporting: "Password 'MyID' not found in /
omd/sites/storage/var/check_mk/core/helper_config/latest/stored_passwords".
This issue occurred because the password store copy was written to the new
configuration area after the `latest` symlink was created.
Since this release the `latest` symlink is now created as the final step, 
which prevents the problem.
