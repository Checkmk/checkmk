After activating the changes, users would occasionally observe crashes of 
special agents or active checks reporting: "Password 'MyID' not found 
in /omd/sites/storage/var/check_mk/core/helper_config/latest/stored_passwords".

This issue occurred because the command line used symlink `latest` to 
access password store and in mean time `latest` has been changed thus 
potentially breaking configuration's integrity.

Since this release the `latest` is not used anymore in command line
which prevents the problem.
