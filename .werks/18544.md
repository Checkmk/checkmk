The TCP fetcher now reports an error when it encounters the IP addresses 0.0.0.0 or ::.
Previously, if the IP resolver failed to determine a valid IP address for a host and returned
these addresses, the fetcher would silently fall back to the local system. This happened
because the underlying socket library implicitly mapped 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) when a
local agent was installed, causing the fetcher to retrieve data from the local host instead of
the intended remote host.

With this update, the TCP fetcher prevents this unintended fallback by explicitly reporting an
error whenever it detects 0.0.0.0 or ::. As a result, users will no longer receive incorrect
local data or experience silent failures. Instead, they will see a clear error message, which
improves troubleshooting and helps identify issues with IP resolution.

No user action is required to benefit from this fix.
