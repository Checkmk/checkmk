The Veeam plugin now performs a preliminary check of the PowerShell and Veeam versions and automatically switches to the correct PowerShell version. This change resolves the issue that previously prevented monitoring of Veeam v13 and newer.

By design the Windows agent executes all PowerShell scripts using an older PowerShell version, which made monitoring the new Veeam releases impossible.

To monitor Veeam 13 and later, you may need to install PowerShell 7 (also known as the new PowerShell or PowerShell Core) on the monitored system. Without PowerShell 7, monitoring will not work correctly.

After installing PowerShell 7, no further configuration is needed, as the plugin automatically uses the correct PowerShell version.
