The Windows agent now converts the output of `w32tm.exe` to `UTF-8`, 
resolving the issue where `w32tm.exe` sends its output in the system 
code page. This fix ensures that time synchronization data is correctly 
displayed and processed in the monitoring and command line interfaces, 
preventing any garbled or incorrect information or crashing.

To benefit from this improvement, users should update their Windows agent 
to the latest version.
