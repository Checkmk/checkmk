Checkmk always discovers the Windows Time service because it is essential for accurately assessing monitoring results. This automatic discovery ensures that time synchronization on Windows systems is properly monitored, which is critical for system performance and log accuracy.

If the Windows Time service is missing, Checkmk sets the corresponding Windows service check to a WARN status by default. This alert notifies users of potential issues with time synchronization. Users should investigate and restore the Windows Time service to maintain accurate and reliable monitoring.
