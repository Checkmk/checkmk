The prior implementation of the `nginx_status` plugin used the `netstat` utility
to fetch network statistics. This was problematic because this utility is
deprecated and no longer shipped to all Linux distributions.

To remedy this, the plugin now uses `ss` from the `iproute2` package as its
preferred utility. If this tool is not installed for whatever reason, the plugin
will then fall back to `netstat`.

In order to make use of this, you will need to update the agent. Hence, why this
change is incompatible.
