There is no guarantee that Jolokia metrics will be found in the agent output.
With the prior implementation, this would lead to a crash report if any of the
metrics are missing.

With this fix, we are now handling the different cases. If at least one metric
is present, the service will be considered `OK`. If no metrics are present in the
data, the service will be considered `UNKNOWN`.

No user intervention is needed to get the benefit of this fix.
