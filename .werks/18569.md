Some environments were raising an `cmk.bi.storage.AggregationNotFound` error.
This was caused by an attempt to load an aggregation with a temporary file
name. It turns out that the condition to determine what is a temporary vs.
aggregation file was too relaxed. This is now improved and the error should no
longer occur.
