This Werk fixes an issue with Jira notifications due to the removal of legacy
search APIs in the Jira Cloud version.

### Removal of workaround might be necessary
To fix compatibility to the new Jira API, you might have followed instructions
to install a compatible version of the Python jira module. Such a workaround was
made available in [our Knowledge Base][kb].

Since the files installed by the workaround will conflict with upcoming updates,
it must be removed before performing the Checkmk update. Thus, this Werk has
been labeled incompatible. To find out whether the workaround has been applied,
check if the `jira` package has been manually installed by issuing a `find`
command:

```shell
OMD[mysite]:~$ find ~/local/lib/python3/ -type d -name 'jira*-info'
```

If the `jira` module is found, uninstall it after stopping the site and before
performing the update by running:

```shell
OMD[mysite]:~$ pip3 uninstall jira
```
