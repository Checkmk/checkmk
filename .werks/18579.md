This werk sets the `$EVENT_TXT$` macro in all notification plugins. The macro
was previously only set for mail/asciimail notifications. Some other plugins
like MS Teams already tried using this macro, the value was always empty.

The behaviour of the macro is now consistent across all plugins. It gives a
short description of the notification type.
Examples: `UP -> DOWN`, `Acknowledged (DOWN)`, `Downtime Start (WARN)`
