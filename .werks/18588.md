The _"Add custom icon or action"_ parameter of the rulesets _"Windows Services"_ and _"State and count of processes"_ / _"Process discovery"_ did not have any effect anymore since Checkmk 2.1.
We remove it.
Custom icons can be configured using the ruleset _"Custom icons or actions for services in status GUI"_.
