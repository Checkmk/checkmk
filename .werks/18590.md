This slightly adjusts the titles shown on the different file types of an MKP.

Some of the types had been marked as deprecated (like "GUI extensions"), while some of the more exotic extention subtypes (like custom icons) are not acually deprecated.
We remove the "(deprecated)" text to avoid confusion.
