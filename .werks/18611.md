Deprecate the Checkmk agent plug-in `hyperv_vms_guestinfos.ps1`,
which provided information about VM status and checkpoints (snapshots). 

Replace it with the new `hyperv_host.ps1` plug-in, which can be enabled
and configured through the Agent Bakery using the **"Hyper-V"** rule set,
or manually installed by placing it in the `%SystemDrive%\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\plugins`
folder on the Windows host.

To ensure uninterrupted monitoring of Hyper-V VMs, please migrate to the new `hyperv_host.ps1` plug-in before upgrading to Checkmk 2.6.0. Without this migration, monitoring of Hyper-V VMs will cease to function after the upgrade.

> **Note:** The old `hyperv_vms_guestinfos.ps1` plug-in will be removed in Checkmk 2.6.0.
