If you currently use the deprecated `hyperv_vms_guestinfos.ps1` plug-in, you must replace it with the new `hyperv_host.ps1` plug-in after upgrading. This new Checkmk agent plug-in replaces the old one and provides more detailed and useful information about your Hyper-V virtual machines, helping you monitor their status and resource usage more effectively.

The new plug-in delivers comprehensive VM data, including:

- General information such as the VM name and machine generation
- The most recent and oldest checkpoints used by the VM
- Usage status of the guest integration services
- Configured RAM details, including start, minimum, maximum, and currently assigned RAM, as well as demand if available
- VHD(X) size and its actual storage consumption on the Hyper-V host
- Network interfaces and their assignment to virtual switches (virtual network adapters connected to virtual networks)

To start using this enhanced monitoring, deploy the plug-in via the Agent Bakery rule set **"Hyper-V"** or manually place the `hyperv_host.ps1` file in the `%SystemDrive%\ProgramData\checkmk\agent\plugins` folder on the Windows host.
