Before the defaults of the "Options" on the Test connection did not respect
the configured rules.

For example, if the Checkmk Agent Port was changed to 6557, instead of 6556, by a ruleset
the default value would still display 6556.

Now rulesets that apply to the host automatically update the default value.
