In some rare cases when using Google Chrome, the entire page would shift upward,
causing the topmost part of the page including the title, breadcrumb, and page menu
to be hidden.

This issue, for example, occurred when embedding a NagVis map within the
"Custom URL" dashlet and configuring NagVis using the dashlet.

This behavior has now been resolved and is consistent with Firefox.
