Setup now ignores .pkl (pickle) files when using GIT version control because
these files are binary and should not be versioned.

Including them previously could lead to large repository sizes.

With this change, .pkl files are automatically excluded from version control,
resulting in smaller repository sizes.

This change also fixes potentially unignored .swp and .mk.new files in subfolders.
