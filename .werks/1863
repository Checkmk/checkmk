Title: cisco_power: fix for cases with a slash in the device description of a power supply

Power Supplies with a slash in the device description were added in service discovery,
but could not be found when carrying out the check. This problem has been fixed.

In addition, when you have power supplies which have a service description
containing the ID of the power supply at the end like "<power supply
name>/<ID>", i.e. with a SLASH, you have to redo the service discovery
and the service description will then contain the ID added with a blank
instead, i.e. "<power supply name> <ID>". This is a rare case only relevant
for versions of cisco_power younger than 2015/01/30, and only if you have
non-unique power supply names with trailing digits in the name.
