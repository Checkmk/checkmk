The `EMC VNX storage systems` special agent and monitoring tools have been removed from Checkmk
2.5.0. This plugin allowed monitoring of `EMC VNX storage systems` by the use of Dell's
`Navisphere Secure CLI (NavisecCLI)` tooling.

Dell replaced `EMC VNX` with `EMC Unity` in 2016, which has lead to `EMC VNX` being maintained more
sparsely and this drop of support has left the tool reliant on outdated and potentially dangerous
dependencies.

In 2.4.0 we deprecated the special agent and with 2.5.0 we are dropping support entirely.
