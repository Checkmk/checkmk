As of this change Checkmk will restrict additional information related to crash reports.

This update will now require users to have the **general.see_crash_reports** in order to see
the following information:

* Render any information other than the ID about a crash report within the GUI interface.
These pages would be displayed at **Monitor > System > Crash reports > Crash report:
\<Crash Report ID\>**. Previously, a user would be displayed a rendered exception on the page
with no additional information.
* See details about the exception in the **Exc.** coloumn on the **Monitor > System >
Crash reports** page.
* Get a detailed crash report on RestAPI request failures. A user without this permission will now
be limited to the basic exception raised and the crash report ID.

These changes are part of our ongoing improvements to the overall security of Checkmk. Therefore,
this security werk is issued with a CVSS score of 0.0 None
(`CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N`).
