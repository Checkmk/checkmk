As of this change, Checkmk's REST API will now reject requests if the associated user requires any of the following actions on their account:

 * Password change
 * Adding a second authentication factor
 * Two-factor authentication (as before)

These actions cannot currently be performed via the REST API.
User need to authenticate to the web GUI in case a password change or setting up two-factor authentication is required.

Both new and existing users are affected by these changes.
*This change has been marked as incompatiable to warn customers who encounter disruptions to their automated REST API setups.*
