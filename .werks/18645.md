SNMP traps sent to Checkmk were not translated in the Event Console because the corresponding MIBs lacked Python-compiled forms. 

This caused certain trap messages to appear with untranslated information, complicating monitoring and troubleshooting.

This patch adds the compiled versions of these MIBs to Checkmk, enabling trap messages to be correctly translated into a clear, human-readable form.

No manual intervention is required.
