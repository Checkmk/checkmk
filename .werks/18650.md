Werk #18082 fixes an issue where Event Console alerts were matched even if they
were not enabled in the notification rules.

Another problem occurred when Event Console alerts were enabled alongside host
and/or service events: in this case, host and service events did not match,
even if no filter for Event Console alerts was defined.

This behavior has now been corrected: host and service events are matched as
expected, even when Event Console alerts are enabled in the events section of a
notification rule, as long as no filters for Event Console alerts are set in
the filter section. Defining filters for Event Console alerts, however, makes
the rule exclusive to EC alerts â€” as in previous versions.
