The netstat linux plugin previously used 'netstat' as the primary tool and fell
back to 'ss' if 'netstat' was unavailable.

This order has now been reversed: 'ss' is used first, and 'netstat' serves only
as a fallback. The change reflects the fact that 'netstat' has been deprecated
for a long time, while 'ss' is the recommended replacement.
