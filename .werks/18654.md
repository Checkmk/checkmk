The backup start message was updated from "The backup has been started" to
"Backup process has started. You can safely navigate away from this page as the
process will continue in the background. Refresh this page to check the current
status."

This change makes it clearer that users do not need to stay on the page while
the backup runs, and also informs that the status will not update automatically
without a manual refresh.
