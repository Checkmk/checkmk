When Event Console notifications were enabled alongside host and/or service
events in a single notification rule, host and service events did not match,
which lead to notifications not being sent, even if no filter for Event Console
alerts was defined.

This behavior has now been corrected: host and service events are matched as
expected, even when Event Console alerts are enabled in the events section of a
notification rule, as long as no filters for Event Console alerts are set in
the filter section. Defining filters for Event Console alerts, however, makes
the rule exclusive to EC alerts â€” as in previous versions before 2.4.

Note:
This change may affect the notification behavior. Please review your
notification rules to ensure they still match the intended configuration.
