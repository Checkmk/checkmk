This change only affects you if you used the "Priority" option with the value
"Emergency" in Pushover notification parameters.

Pushover notifications previously used the wrong receipt, using the user/group
key instead. This has been corrected to use the proper receipt value.

Additionally, the receipt is no longer mandatory, restoring the behavior from
earlier 2.3 versions.
