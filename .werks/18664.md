When deleting users, a new validation checks whether they are referenced in
notification rules as "Specific user". If a user is set as the only explicit
user, a warning message is displayed with a link to the affected notification
rules.

The user will still be deleted.

Furthermore, the notification rule list will now show a warning icon in the
contact section of rules with an explicit user that does not exist.
