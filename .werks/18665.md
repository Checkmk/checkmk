Fixed the "Use site ID prefix" option in ServiceNow notifications, which was not processed correctly in earlier 2.4 versions. This issue caused notifications to omit the expected site ID prefixes.

After upgrading, the option now correctly includes the site ID prefix as intended. If you use this option and have upgraded from an earlier 2.4 version, please review and verify your ServiceNow notification settings to ensure the "Use site ID prefix" option is properly enabled and functioning.
