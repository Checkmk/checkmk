This issue only affects users of Synthetic monitoring, specifically of the managed robots feature.

In case there were agent packages that included managed robots, the _Bake (and sign) agents_ buttons in the UI where always colored in orange, indicating that there are new packages to be baked.
This was the case even if there were no new packages to be baked.

Furthermore, navigating to the agent bakery in the UI resulted in error messages such as
```
2025-09-26 11:53:51,323 [30] [cmk.web 165936] Error processing bakery_file_status.mk ('/omd/sites/my_site/var/robotmk/managed_robots/24c0145b-2a4e-4afc-ba36-80796bfcec98/config.json' is not in the subpath of '/omd/sites/my_site/share/check_mk/agents'), marking bakery file status as dirty.
```
in the log file `var/log/web.log`.

Note that the baked agent packages were still valid and functioning.
