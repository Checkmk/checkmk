The REST API endpoint `check_mk/api/1.0/domain-types/host_config/actions/wait-for-completion/invoke` previously lacked proper validation of user permissions.

As a result, any authenticated user could invoke this endpoint without having the necessary permissions to manage or view the status of system jobs. This allowed any **authenticated users** to monitor the execution
and completion status of renaming jobs (e.g., status codes 204, 302, 404). No sensitive information was returned from this API endpoint.

The appropriate permissions are now required to invoke this endpoint, and this change is documented in the REST API documentation.
