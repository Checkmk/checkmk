The REST API endpoint `check_mk/api/1.0/domain-types/parent_scan/actions/start/invoke` previously lacked proper validation of user permissions.

As a result, any authenticated user could invoke this endpoint without having the necessary permissions to manage or view the status of system jobs.
This allowed any **authenticated users** to start the parent scan background job. No sensitive information was returned during this process.

The appropriate permissions are now required to invoke this endpoint, and this change is documented in the REST API documentation.
