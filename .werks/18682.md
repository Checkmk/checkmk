With some types of Azure Recovery Services vault backup containers, the
`azure_vault_backup_containers` check plugin would fail to parse the response
from the Azure API due to a missing expected field, resulting in a crash of the
plugin. The plugin has been updated to make the field optional so that parsing
now succeeds in this case.
