When doing a bulk import of hosts via the Hosts settings page in the UI, in
most cases, empty lines are ignored. However, due to a bug in parsing, empty
lines in certain locations in the file (before the title line if a title line
is being used, and before the first row containing host data), would cause
parsing to fail.

This Werk fixes that and now empty lines are also ignored in these places.
