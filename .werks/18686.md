Two check plug-ins have been added and the Windows agent updated to allow for the monitoring of time synchronization on Windows systems via the Windows Time Service (W32Time).

These enhancements provide more detailed and reliable insights into time synchronization, helping you detect and troubleshoot related issues more effectively.

- The first check plug-in, `w32time_status`, creates a service that provides general information about the status of time synchronization on the system. This includes the following information about the last sync: time offset, time since last sync, source of last sync, root dispersion, root delay, stratum, and error information (if an error occurred while attempting to sync).

- The second plug-in, `w32time_peers`, creates a service for each time server peer configured on the monitored system. It includes options to alert you when W32Time encounters difficulties contacting or transacting with a peer, and includes, for each peer: Time of last successful transaction with the peer, total and consecutive sync failure counts, error details (if an error occurred while attempting to sync), stratum, and time of next sync attempt.

See the checkman pages for these plug-ins for more information.
