This is a follow-up to Werk 17623.

The methodology for calculating CPU utilization has been updated
for NetApp ONTAP versions 9.15.1P2 through 9.15.1P6, as addressed in CONTAP-377586.

As of this werk we change how we retrieve the CPU utilization for NetApp nodes
by implementing the use of a new metric, 'metric.processor_utilization',
which directly reports the average CPU utilization of the node.
This metric is available starting from version 9.8 of the NetApp ONTAP API.
