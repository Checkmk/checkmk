The Azure storage performance service occasionally displayed an "UNKN" state
with summary "Item not found in monitoring data."
The issue was caused by the inherent latency of certain Azure metrics,
which are only available after specific, defined time intervals.

To resolve this, we increased the latency threshold within the special agent.
This fix ensures that the monitoring now correctly captures metrics
that were previously being missed due to their delayed availability

Users do not need to take any action to benefit from this fix,
which improves the accuracy and reliability of performance monitoring for storage accounts.
