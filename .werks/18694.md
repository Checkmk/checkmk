Previously, the mk-job script always redefined the MK_VARDIR variable at the beginning of execution.

The script will now use the existing MK_VARDIR environment variable if it is set.
If the variable is not set, the script will fall back to its default, hard-coded value.

This werk is flagged as potentially incompatible because it alters how the script uses MK_VARDIR.
Customers who previously relied on the script overwriting a value should verify their setup
to ensure the script now executes under the desired conditions.
