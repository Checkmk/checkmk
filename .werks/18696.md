NetApp interfaces were previously reported as 'up' regardless of their actual state,
which could lead to missed alerts.

NetApp monitoring now reports the actual state of each individual interface.

This change is incompatible. After upgrading, please run a rediscovery of the NetApp interfaces
- either via the monitoring GUI or by executing the command `cmk -II <netapp-hostname>` -
to update the monitoring with the current interface states.
