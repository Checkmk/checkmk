The effect of the rules "Assignment of hosts to contact groups"/"Assignment of services to contact groups" are not clear from the name.
They did not assign contact groups to the host's permission, but limited visibility when monitoring hosts/services to contact groups instead.

These monitoring rules have been renamed to "Set host visibility for contact groups"/"Set service visibility for contact groups" to avoid any further misunderstandings.
