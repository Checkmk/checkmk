Hostname input now automatically removes leading and trailing whitespace characters to prevent crashes and incorrect rule application caused by whitespace in hostnames. The following characters are trimmed from the beginning and end of hostnames:

- space " "
- tab "\t"
- new line "\n"
- carriage return "\r"

Previously, hostnames containing such whitespace could lead to system crashes or improperly applied rulesets. This change ensures that users do not need to update existing hostnames to avoid these issues. However, users should review and correct any manually entered hostnames with whitespace in configuration files or rules to ensure consistent behavior.
