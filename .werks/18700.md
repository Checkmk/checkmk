mk_oracle sometimes produces output where two sections are concatenated without a line break. This happens due to misconfigured NLS parameters or errors in custom SQL statements, making the output unable to process.

To fix this, mk_oracle now outputs an explicit new line before and after each SQL-based section. This ensures that sections are properly separated without requiring any changes to your existing configuration.
