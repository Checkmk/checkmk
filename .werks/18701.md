The aws_lambda_concurrency service no longer outputs an UNKNOWN state while executed when no explicit check parameters are set. It now provides the corresponding metric and result with state = OK when no upper levels are being set.

Users will no longer see confusing UNKNOWN states for the aws_lambda_concurrency service when no thresholds are configured, improving monitoring clarity. No action is required from users to benefit from this fix.
