The AWS Lambda Performance check crashed when expected CloudWatch metrics (Duration, Errors, and Throttles) were missing.
This issue has been fixed, and the check now displays a message indicating which of these metrics are unavailable.

For missing metrics now “Item not found in monitoring data” is shown.
