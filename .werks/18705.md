The Orion Power System Controller check reported an incorrect power factor, causing the displayed power to be one-tenth of the actual value. As a result, users may have underestimated power usage or capacity based on these readings.

This error has been corrected, and the check now reports the correct power output in line with the controller’s specifications. No user action is required, but please be aware that historical power data collected before this fix may be inaccurate.
