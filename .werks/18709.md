This werk deprecates the option 'Prometheus Scrape Targets' in the Prometheus rule.
We recommend transitioning to our Kubernetes integration (https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/monitoring_kubernetes.html),
if you want to monitor a Kubernetes environment. For monitoring Prometheus exporters or Prometheus metrics endpoints directly
in general, please use the dedicated OpenTelemetry (https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/opentelemetry.html) integration, as
it is the more robust and appropriate solution for that use case.
