Prior to this werk, saml2 configurations which had
the idp metadata uploaded as file required the file
to be reuploaded in order to save the configuration
during edit. This werk now displays the file content
when inspecting the configuration and no longer requires
the reupload. This werk also includes an update action
which adjusts the existing saml2 configurations.
