  The SAP HANA agent plugin now enforces a 30-second timeout for potentially blocking operations, specifically the execution of the
  `landscapeHostConfiguration.py` and `systemReplicationStatus.py` scripts. This prevents the plugin from hanging indefinitely when SAP HANA
  Python support scripts become unresponsive due to an inconsistent database state, startup or shutdown phases, or network connectivity
  issues.

  This improvement ensures continuous data collection and more reliable monitoring of SAP HANA components, even when the database
  experiences problems. Previously, hanging processes could prevent the Checkmk agent from completing its data collection cycle, causing
  delayed or missing SAP HANA monitoring data and potential resource exhaustion on the monitored system.

  Users should update their Checkmk agent to benefit from this fix and avoid manual intervention.
