  Adds the new corosync_latency check plug-in that monitors inter-node link latency in Corosync clusters.
  It discovers one service per Corosync link and reports both the maximum and average latency.
  You can configure warning and critical thresholds for latency.
  The check triggers WARN or CRIT alerts if latency exceeds the configured thresholds or if a link stops reporting.
  The service auto-discovers during the next inventory when Corosync latency data is available, requiring no manual migration.
