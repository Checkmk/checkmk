Proxmox VE node info service monitors subscription expiration dates, providing proactive notifications to help users avoid service interruptions.
This monitoring is enabled by default, ensuring users are informed well in advance of their subscription expiry.

By default, the service issues a warning at 30 days and a critical alert at 7 days before subscription expiration.
These thresholds can be customized through the rule configuration.
