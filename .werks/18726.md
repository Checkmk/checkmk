The ruleset for the "Proxmox VE Node Info" check has been improved to offer more granular control over monitoring states for different node and subscription statuses.
This enhancement allows users to tailor alert responses more precisely, improving the relevance of monitoring notifications.

Previously, the ruleset only supported specifying a single required status for both node status and subscription status.
If the actual status did not match the required one, the service would enter a WARN state.

The new ruleset enables configuring individual monitoring states (OK, WARN, CRIT) for each possible node status — active, offline, unknown
and each subscription status—new, active, notfound, invalid, expired, suspended. This flexibility lets users define distinct alert levels for each status.

This change is fully compatible with existing configurations. During migration, old string-based required status settings are automatically converted:
if a specific status was required (e.g., "online"), that status is set to OK and all others to WARN (or CRIT for expired subscriptions).
If no status was required (empty string), the related configuration is removed from the ruleset. Users should review their migrated rules to take advantage of the new granularity and adjust monitoring states as needed.

The default behavior remains unchanged: node status "online" and subscription statuses "new" and "active" are treated as OK, while other statuses trigger appropriate warning or critical states.
