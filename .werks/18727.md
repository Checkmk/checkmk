NTI EnviroMux monitoring now supports the allExternalSensorTable in addition to individual sensor monitoring.

It supports three types of external sensors: temperature, voltage, and humidity.

Each sensor is automatically discovered and monitored, with the service item composed of the sensor description and index as reported by the device. Monitoring uses the same thresholds and check logic as existing individual EnviroMux sensor checks.

Users will now automatically see additional external sensors monitored without any manual configuration, improving environmental monitoring coverage. No action is required to enable this feature.
