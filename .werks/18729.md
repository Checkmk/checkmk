The IPMI special agent now supports selecting the IPMI 2.0 cipher suite ID.

A new rule parameter, "Cipher suite ID," offers two choices: 3 and 17.

Existing rules without this parameter are automatically migrated and continue to use cipher suite ID 3 to maintain current behavior.

New rules default to cipher suite ID 17, which provides stronger security.

No action is required unless you want to enable the stronger cipher suite; in that case, update the rule to select cipher suite ID 17.
