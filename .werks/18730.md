The Robotmk scheduler now supports running individual plans on demand, making it easier to test, debug, or selectively execute specific automation plans without modifying configuration files.

**New Command-Line Option**

Use the new `--plan` flag to specify which plan to execute:

```
robotmk_scheduler config.json --plan my_plan_id
```

When this flag is provided, only the plan with the matching ID will be executed. If the specified plan ID doesn't exist in the configuration, the scheduler exits with a clear error message.

**Behavior**

- **Without `--plan`**: All configured plans execute normally according to their scheduled intervals
- **With `--plan <id>`**: Only the specified plan runs once, then the scheduler terminates
- **Invalid plan ID**: The scheduler exits with an error instead of silently executing nothing

This feature is particularly useful for troubleshooting individual plans or running specific tests in development environments.
