This release introduces several new checks and inventory features to enhance Proxmox VE monitoring.

- We have added node CPU allocation and node memory allocation checks that calculate and monitor allocation and overcommitment ratios for each Proxmox VE node. These checks include configurable thresholds, allowing users to tailor alerts to their environment.

- A new replication check monitors Proxmox VE VM replication jobs by tracking their current state, the last successful run, and any error conditions. This helps ensure replication processes are functioning correctly.

- HA manager status monitoring has been added for Proxmox VE clusters. It covers the cluster and manager state as well as relevant status details of the HA subsystem, providing deeper insight into high-availability operations.

- Node directory filesystem and node LVM filesystem checks now monitor capacity and usage on Proxmox VE node filesystems. These checks reuse the common filesystem logic for consistency and reliability.

- Node storage monitoring has been extended to track how much storage is provisioned or committed versus physically used for both directory and LVM storages. This includes ratios provided as performance data, offering a clearer picture of storage utilization.

- We have introduced hardware and software inventory for Proxmox VE nodes and VMs. This collects node attributes, VM attributes, and related metadata into dedicated inventory sections, facilitating better asset management.

- Node and VM info services have been extended with Proxmox-specific attributes. Additionally, host labels derived from node and VM properties have been added to support more fine-grained rule conditions.

- Finally, the VM info and VM snapshot age services have been improved with richer output and enhanced parameterization. This allows for more precise tuning of snapshot age handling and VM metadata reporting.
