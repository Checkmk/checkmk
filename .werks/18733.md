Added three new checks implementing the RED Method for service monitoring, enhancing the ability to track service performance with standardized metrics.

The RED (Rate, Errors, Duration) Method is a service-based monitoring approach analogous to the USE Method used for hardware monitoring. It focuses on measuring request rates, error rates, and request durations to provide comprehensive insights into service health.

These new checks monitor requests, latency, and errors using the following standardized OpenTelemetry (OTel) metrics:
* `http.server.request.duration` for HTTP-based services;
* `rpc.server.duration` for RPC-based services.

If neither of these two metrics is available, the checks will fall back to using the `traces.span.metrics.duration` metric, which is derived from span data emitted by the span metrics collector.

By implementing these checks, users gain more detailed and standardized insights into service performance, enabling improved monitoring and troubleshooting of service-based applications.
