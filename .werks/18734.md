The OTel Collector configuration now uses a clearer permission model with two permissions:

read_otel_collector — allows viewing OTel Collector configurations

otel_collector — grants full access, including creating, editing, and deleting configurations

Users with only read_otel_collector can view all configuration details but will receive a permission error if they attempt to edit or delete anything.
This lets operational users access the information they need without exposing administrative actions.

Additionally, the OTel receiver listing page now shows HTTP and gRPC credentials, making it easier for users to retrieve the required connection parameters for their agents or scrapers.

Administrators should review existing roles to ensure users have the appropriate level of access.
