The Apache ActiveMQ Queue lengths check now supports configuring upper and lower threshold levels for the consumer count.

This enhancement allows users to set specific alerting limits when the number of consumers is either too high or too low.
By enabling these thresholds, monitoring and alerting for Apache ActiveMQ queues become more precise and customizable, helping to better detect and respond to unusual consumer activity.
Users need to configure these upper and lower levels to take advantage of this improved control.

## Migration of existing checks

Existing checks that used the old `consumerCount` setting are automatically migrated to the new upper/lower threshold format:

- If the previous configuration had **higher critical than warning thresholds**, it becomes an **upper-level alert** (triggering when consumer count is too high).
- If the previous configuration had **lower critical than warning thresholds**, it becomes a **lower-level alert** (triggering when consumer count is too low).

This ensures that previously configured alerts continue to work correctly without any manual changes.
