The OTel collector memory check now automatically uses the memory limits configured for the collector.

It raises warnings at 80% of the effective memory limit and triggers a critical state before any data is dropped.
When these alerts occur, the collector’s memory usage should be reviewed and the configured limits adjusted if necessary.

This enhancement allows early detection of memory pressure without requiring additional rule configuration.
