The `memory_limiter` processor expects the parameters `limit_mib` and `spike_limit_mib` to be specified in **Mebibytes (MiB)**.

Currently, raw byte values are being passed instead.
This causes the collector to set memory limits that are 1,048,576 times higher than intended, which may prevent effective memory limiting and potentially lead to excessive memory usage by the collector.

This update introduces a conversion constant to correctly scale the input values to MiB.
As a result, memory limits will now be enforced as expected.


### Action Required

To ensure these corrected limits are applied to your environment, affected users should perform a **minor "dummy" change** (such as adding a comment) to the OpenTelemetry configuration.
This will trigger a refresh of the YAML configuration and activate the updated scaling logic.
