Title: Fixed possible shell injection when filtering the EC archive
Level: 2
Component: ec
Class: security
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1422344183

To optimize searches in the Event Console archive files, the event console
uses "grep" to make a fast preselection of history entries. The grep command
is used for different filters, like the "ID of rule". This allows normal logged
in users with only GUI privileges to execute shell commands on the monitoring
host with privileges of the user the Event Console is running with. Normally
this is the sites user in OMD sites or the user nagios.

All currently maintained versions are affected. If you are using an affected
version which we offer no more releases for, you can use the patch of
this Werk to fix the issue for your version.

This issue has been discovered and reported by Christian Thiemann. Thanks!
