This change only affects you if Checkmk has been in use and was updated from
version 1.6 onward.

Between versions 1.6 and 2.0, the format of the 'From' option changed from a
string to a dictionary. Since no migration step existed for this old format,
updates could fail when migrating to the new notification parameters.
This has now been addressed.
