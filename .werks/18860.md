Since 2.3, host names in rule host conditions are validated.

Previously, users sometimes entered a pattern like 'MYHOST\*' without
prefixing it with '~' to mark it as a regex. In such cases, the ruleset pages
could break.

Now, the pre-update check also validates host conditions. The update can be
aborted if invalid values are detected, preventing broken rulesets.
