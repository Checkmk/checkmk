Previously, the "Show notification context" feature in "Analyze recent
notifications" displayed only the raw notification context.

Since the notification context is enriched with additional keys during
notification processing (e.g., host labels), we now store the enriched context
in the backlog. This ensures that the displayed context matches the data used
during notification handling.
