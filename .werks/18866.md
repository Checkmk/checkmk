This change only affects users who used the “Service service level” or “Host
service level” sorters in their views.

The initial sorting of host and service level sorters was incorrect.
When a view was opened, no sorting was applied, although manual sorting still
worked as expected.

The appropriate sorters are now applied automatically when the view is loaded.
