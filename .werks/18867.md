In large environments, with a huge configuration (thousands of folders), the
processing of notifications could become slow (minutes per notifications), even
leading to timeouts during notification processing.

The notification system previously reloaded the configuration on each
invocation of "cmk --notify" to perform rule matching. In large environments,
this reload could become slow after configuration changes, leading to timeouts
during notification processing.

With this werk the notification system leverages the automation helpers introduced in
version 2.4, which maintain the current configuration. Notification processing
is triggered through an automation call, eliminating the need to reload the
configuration on every notification.

If the automation-helper daemon is unavailable, the system logs the
notification as failed and retries execution up to the configured maximum
number of attempts.

This improvement enhances notification processing speed and reliability in
large environments, significantly reducing timeouts.
