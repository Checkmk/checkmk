This werk only effects you if you want to upgrade from 2.3 to 2.4.

Werk #18859 in 2.4.0p16 introduced a new migration of old HTML email "From"
parameters. This update action could fail, preventing the update to continue,
if notification rules with option "Cancel previous notifications" were used.

In such cases an error like "TypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not
iterable" occurred.

A possible workaround was to disable notifications in version 2.3 using the
“Master switch” in the sidebar and changing all HTML email notification rules
with option "Cancel previous notifications” to “Create notifications with the
following parameters.” before updating. After the update, you simply switch the
rules back to “Suppress all previous” and re-enable notifications via the
“Master switch.”
