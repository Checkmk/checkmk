Since version 2.4.0, deleting an alert handler no longer worked when only a
single alert handler remained in the list on the "Alert handlers" page.
If the list contained exactly one entry, attempting to delete it had no effect
and the alert handler remained visible.

This behavior has now been fixed, and the final remaining alert handler can be
deleted as expected.
