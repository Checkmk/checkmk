Werk #18658 fixed the general logic of event console alert and host/service
event matching.

However, a remaining issue caused host and service notifications to match
even when only event console alerts were selected.

This is now fixed.

Furthermore, filtering for service events on event console alerts is available
again. This is particularly useful when you need to differentiate between open
and closed alerts.
