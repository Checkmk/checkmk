After adding a host and selecting an option including “Checkmk agent” under
“Monitoring agents,” the “Test agent connection” button appears. Clicking this
button immediately verifies whether the Checkmk agent is installed and properly
connected to the host, allowing you to easily confirm agent installation and
connectivity right after adding a host. This helps prevent monitoring issues
from the start.

If no agent is detected, an error message provides two clear options to guide
you through the next steps: “Download Checkmk agent” to begin the installation,
or “Retest agent connection” to check again after installation. This
straightforward process simplifies troubleshooting and reduces setup errors.
