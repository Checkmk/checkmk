This werk resolves an issue where HTTP proxy configurations using a Unique ID
containing a hyphen (-) caused errors in certain parts of the GUI.

While such IDs were accepted in version 2.3 and could still be saved in version
2.4, they led to tracebacks in specific configuration dialogs. Affected areas
included, among others:

- Configuration of the Azure connector
- Notification parameters for MS Teams, SIGNL4, iLert, and similar integrations

At the same time, other features such as the Check HTTP web service rule were
able to use the same proxy configuration without issues, indicating
inconsistent handling rather than a global limitation.

The root cause was that some components expected the proxy ID to be a valid,
non-reserved Python identifier, resulting in errors like
"ValueError: 'foo-bar' is not a valid, non-reserved Python identifier".

Proxy IDs containing hyphens are now handled consistently across the GUI,
preventing these errors and allowing the configuration to be used reliably in
all relevant contexts.
