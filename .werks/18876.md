The service discovery now uses the agent connection test introduced in werk
#18872.

When you start service discovery for a host with the “Checkmk agent” option
selected under “Monitoring agents,” the system automatically verifies whether
the Checkmk agent is installed and properly connected to the host. If the agent
is detected successfully, service discovery proceeds as normal.

If no agent is detected, a popup offers two options: “Download Checkmk agent”
to install it or “Read Checkmk user guide” for installation details.
