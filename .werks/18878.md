In Checkmk 2.5, the "System time" service is no longer monitored by default on Windows.

To retain the old behavior you can explicitly enable "System time (time synchronization)" using the agent rule "Enabled sections (Windows agent)" if using the agent bakery, or explicitly list `systemtime` as an enabled section in the Windows agent configuration file.

See the werk #18686 for details regarding the new Windows time synchronization monitoring checks.
