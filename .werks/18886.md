Previously, the single folder deployment (via the rule `Customize agent package
(Linux)`) could not be used with the rule `Oracle databases (Linux, Solaris, AIX,
Windows)`. While the package itself could be created, the installation would
result in the following error:
```
chgrp: cannot access '/etc/check_mk/sqlnet.ora': No such file or directory
warning: %posttrans(check-mk-agent-2.4.0p15-0000000000000000.noarch) scriptlet failed, exit status 1
```
