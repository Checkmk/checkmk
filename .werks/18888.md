In Werk [#15515](https://checkmk.com/werk/15515) the deprecation of the old HTTP monitoring plug-in was announced.
With this Werk, the rule set has been deprecated.
This means it is no longer possible to create new rules.
All other statements remain true as of Checkmk 2.5.0:

- The plug-in file is still shipped with Checkmk and can be accessed with the generic rule set for active checks.
- All existing rules will still be used.
