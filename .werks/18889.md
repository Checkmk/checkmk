Previously, the HW/SW inventory would only show a single entry if the name of
the graphic cards were the same, e.g.,
```
00:08.1 VGA compatible controller: Microsoft Corporation Hyper-V virtual VGA (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
        Subsystem: Hightech Information System Ltd. Device 200c
        Kernel driver in use: hyperv_drm
00:08.2 VGA compatible controller: Microsoft Corporation Hyper-V virtual VGA (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
        Subsystem: Hightech Information System Ltd. Device 200d
        Kernel driver in use: hyperv_drm
```
With this Werk, one entry for each slot is created.

Thank you to mayrstefan for this contribution.
