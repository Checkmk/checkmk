The Checkmk discovery service encountered an issue on Azure hosts related to parsing the `azure_resource_health` section.
Users may notice missing or incomplete Azure resource health data in their monitoring as a result.
Specifically, the discovery service reported the error message: _Parsing of section `azure_resource_health` failed._
This problem occurred when an Azure tag included the "|" character, which caused the parsing to fail.
To avoid this issue, ensure that Azure tags do not contain the "|" character or update Checkmk to a version where this issue is resolved.
