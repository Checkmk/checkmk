In certain scenarios, the AWS agent crashed with the followin error:
```
TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'float'
```
This crash interrupts the collection of AWS monitoring data, potentially leading to gaps or missing information in your monitoring.
To resolve this issue, update to a Checkmk version that includes the fix.
