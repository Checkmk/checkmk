The HW/SW inventory of Windows hosts might have been missing software packages.
Specifically, packages containing the ASCII control character 31 in their data (title, version, etc.) were affected.
To resolve this issue, users must update the agent on the affected hosts.
Additionally, the data collection interval of the HW/SW inventory plugin is configurable via the rule _HW/SW Inventory (Linux, Windows, Solaris, AIX)_.
After updating the agent, it can take up to one collection interval for the fix to take effect.
