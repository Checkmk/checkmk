For security reasons, the secret field was removed from the site management REST-API responses as described in https://checkmk.com/werk/18286.

Previously, the presence of the secret was used to determine the login status of a remote siteâ€”that is, if a secret was present, the remote site was considered logged in; if not, it was considered logged out.

To restore this functionality without exposing the secret, we have introduced a new boolean field, `logged_in`, in the REST-API responses. When you call the site management endpoints, the response for remote sites now includes this `logged_in` field to clearly indicate whether the site is logged in or logged out.

If you have scripts or integrations that rely on remote site login status, please update them to use the new `logged_in` field. After upgrading, modify your API clients to check the `logged_in` boolean in the REST-API responses.
