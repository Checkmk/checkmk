Manual proxies were previously configured as a single string in the following format:

`<scheme>://<username>:<password>@<server_name>:<port>`

Now, manual proxies use separate fields for each component of the URL. This new configuration also supports storing passwords securely in the password store, enhancing overall security.

During the update, existing proxy configurations using the old URL format are automatically converted. No user action is required. After the update, users can manage each proxy component individually in the configuration interface, making it easier to update credentials or server details.
