Notification parameter hashing previously failed when lists contained dictionaries because the process involved sorting the lists first, which caused issues with dictionary elements.

We have resolved this by converting any dictionaries within the lists to tuples before hashing. This change ensures that notification parameters are now processed correctly without errors. The update is fully transparent to users and requires no action on their part.
