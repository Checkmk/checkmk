Previously, the system loaded all changes from every site provided by the caller. This included sites that were logged out or disabled.

As a result, the REST API response contained changes from all sites, regardless of their active status. This could lead to confusion and unnecessary data processing.

With this update, the REST API now returns only the changes from sites that are currently activated. This ensures the response is more relevant and reduces noise. No user action is required.
