Rest-API notification rule creation now makes all non-required fields optional, aligning with the behavior of the UI. Previously, all fields were mandatory when creating a notification rule via the Rest-API.

This change simplifies the process by allowing you to omit optional fields, reducing the chance of errors and making your scripts easier to write and maintain. Existing scripts that include all fields will continue to work without any modifications.
