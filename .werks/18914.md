The folder_config REST API endpoint accidentally lost the 'cmk_agent_connection' field during code refactoring. This field is essential for managing specific agent connection settings within folder configurations.

This werk restores the 'cmk_agent_connection' field to the folder_config REST API endpoint, resolving issues caused by its removal. Users relying on this field can continue using their existing API calls and configurations without changes.
