The "Configuration connection" now allows configuring all fields regardless of the value of "enable_replication" to align the REST API with the UI. Previously, when "enable_replication" was set to false, not all fields within the "Configuration connection" could be configured.

Note that this change breaks scripts that only included the "enable_replication" field within the request. As a result, some of the other fields within the "Configuration connection" are now required. If your scripts do not include these fields, you may encounter errors or failures when configuring the connection via the REST API.

If your scripts configure the "Configuration connection" via the REST API and only include the "enable_replication" field, you must update them to include all required fields within the "Configuration connection" section, regardless of the "enable_replication" value. Please review and adjust your scripts accordingly to ensure compatibility.
