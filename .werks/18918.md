Microsoft Exchange servers with installed versions 2019 or later cannot be queried for the content index state on Database Availability Groups (DAG). Instead of returning a proper status, the `Get-MailboxDatabaseCopyStatus` command shows `ContentIndex: NotApplicable`.

Previously, the `Exchange DAG ContentIndex` service could not handle this value, which caused it to enter a `WARN` state.

With this Werk, the service will no longer be discovered when the agent output contains `ContentIndex: NotApplicable`. Additionally, already discovered services will now display a deprecation note along with an `OK` state instead of a `WARN` state.

As a result, users will no longer receive WARN alerts caused by unsupported content index states on Exchange 2019 or newer servers. No action is required, but the `Exchange DAG ContentIndex` service will not be monitored on these servers going forward. Existing services will clearly indicate this change through the deprecation note and OK status.
