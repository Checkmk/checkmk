This Werk fixes a regression that came with Checkmk 2.4.0.

The distributed agent bakery was designed to enables users to flexibly register their hosts for agent updates at any site in a distributed monitoring.<br>
This mechanism broke with Checkmk 2.4, making it only possible to register for agent updates at the remote site that actually monitors the registerung host, or at the central site.
