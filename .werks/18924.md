The Checkmk FreeBSD agent updates its default installation paths as follows:

* Configuration path: `/usr/local/etc/check_mk` (previously `/etc/check_mk`)
* Variable data path: `/var/db/check_mk_agent` (previously `/var/lib/check_mk_agent`)

The new paths follow FreeBSD filesystem conventions.
*Note*:<br>This change may break workflows or scripts referencing the old paths. If you are affected by this change, please update the mentioned paths to ensure continued operation.

Technical background:<br>
On FreeBSD, the Checkmk agent package is typically installed via _ports_ or pre-compiled packages. Configuration files are expected under `/usr/local/etc`. Additionally, FreeBSD uses `/var/db` instead of `/var/lib`.
