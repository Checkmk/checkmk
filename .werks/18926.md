This werk addresses two bugs:

* Users without permission to download all agents could not download generic folder agent packages. The download page showed links by agent hash, which requires higher permissions.
* The REST API endpoint _Download agent by host or folder name and operating system_, when specifying the _folder\_name_ argument, returned a 404 error.

These two bugs had the same root cause: Baked agent packages assigned to Setup folders were not downloadable by folder path, but only by assigned hosts (if any) or agent hash.<br>
