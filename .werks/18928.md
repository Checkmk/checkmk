In the 2.5 release, we've introduced a global search that unifies the results
from the Setup, Monitoring, and Customize providers into one. This feature
queries each provider, combines and sorts the results, then displays them within
our Vue frontend application.

You can toggle the global search from anywhere by using the `Ctrl-k` shortcut.
By default, it will search across all providers, but you can also specify a
provider like Setup or Monitoring. In addition, we still support inline
Monitoring filters like `s:` to search by service. The other available filters
are documented from within the search window.

The existing Setup and Monitoring menus items, as well as the Quicksearch
sidebar element, remain available, so you can continue using your current
workflows without interruption.

The global search is enabled by default and requires no additional
configuration. We welcome your feedback to help us improve this feature in
future releases.
