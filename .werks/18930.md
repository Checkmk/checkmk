This change is considered a fix instead of a feature because the Linux plugin
has been available for quite sometime. The only thing missing was making it
available in the agent bakery.

With this fix, you can now bake the agent plugin for Linux environments. We also
updated the rule documentation to make this clear. Unlike the Windows rule, the
path to the Nvidia SMI executable does not need to be specified. Simply save the
configuration with its defaults and bake it.
