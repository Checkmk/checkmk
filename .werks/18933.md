With this Werk, Checkmk is now fully built and validated for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10.

All RHEL 10 packages are produced using an AlmaLinux 10 build environment that is fully compatible with RHEL, and the resulting builds undergo comprehensive testing to ensure complete functional and binary compatibility.
