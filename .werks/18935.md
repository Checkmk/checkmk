An OpenSSL upgrade in supported distributions caused several system commands to fail when executed by an OMD site user. This broke the Baking agents feature, which depends on these commands.

To fix this, we now wrap the affected commands to ensure they use the system-supplied OpenSSL library when run by an OMD site user. The wrapped commands are:

* curl
* nslookup
* pdftoppm
* rpmbuild
* scp
* ssh
* zypper

Users running Baking agents on the following operating systems may have experienced failures due to this issue:

* SLES 15 SP5, 15 SP6, 15 SP7
* RHEL 9, 10
* Debian 13

With this update, these commands will function correctly under the OMD site user, restoring Baking agents functionality without requiring any user intervention.
