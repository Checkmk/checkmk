Werk #18935 introduced a number of wrappers for system commands to address OpenSSL compatibility issues. Where-in using system commands as the site user resulted in errors like the following:

```
host: /omd/sites/main/lib/libcrypto.so.3: version `OPENSSL_3.4.0' not found (required by /lib64/libisc-9.16.23-RH.so)
```

This werk extends that change to wrap several more system commands:

* host
* dig
* php

Users can add additional wrappers as needed, by copying an existing wrapper in the sites `bin` directory and naming it for the system command they wish to wrap:

E.g. `cp ./bin/host ./bin/COMMAND_NAME`
