The prometheus special agent was failing during activate changes with the following error:

```
host configuration requires a datasource but none configured
```

This error would occur when a Prometheus agent rule was configured
to match a host that did not have a configured IP address.

This fix ensures that the agent can successfully process the configuration
and activate changes even when the target host's IP is missing.
