The NetApp ONTAP interface check now correctly monitors and reports the configured failover policy for each network interface.

Previously, the check did not accurately report the failover policy of individual interfaces;
instead, it showed the same failover policy for all interfaces on a given node
if one of them had a non-handled failover policy configured.
In addition, we now display the failover policy in the service summary regardless of the service status.

No action is required.
