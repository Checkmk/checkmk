The NetApp ONTAP interface check now displays failover policy names using CLI terminology
instead of REST API terminology, improving consistency with NetApp's command-line interface.

Previously, the check displayed failover policy names exactly as received from the REST API
(e.g., "default", "home_port_only", "broadcast_domain_only").
However, these differ from the terminology used in NetApp's CLI,
which could cause confusion for administrators familiar with CLI commands.

The check now translates REST API policy names to their CLI equivalents:

* `home_port_only` → `disabled`
* `default` → `system-defined`
* `home_node_only` → `local-only`
* `sfo_partners_only` → `sfo-partner-only`
* `broadcast_domain_only` → `broadcast-domain-wide`

No action is required.
