With this werk, we are fixing a performance degradation introduced with werk #17743:
the Azure resource health API we were using returns health data for all resources
in the monitored subscription.
This causes a huge slowdown when many resources where present.

We have optimized how the agent interacts with the Azure Resource Health API.
The agent now targets only the specific resource groups containing monitored resources.
Furthermore, these queries are now processed in parallel via threading.
This results in a significant performance boost for users with large Azure subscriptions.
