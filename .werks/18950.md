The special agent for NetApp ONTAP now filters quota reports directly in the API call
instead of retrieving all quota types and filtering locally.
This change significantly reduces the amount of data transferred from the NetApp system.

Previously, the agent fetched all quota report entries and then filtered for `type=tree`
in the Python code. This change moves the filter to the API request itself, significantly
reducing the amount of data transferred from the NetApp system and improving the overall
performance of the special agent, especially in environments with many quota entries.

Thanks to GitHub user meni2029 for contributing this enhancement.
