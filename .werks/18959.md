The monitor all services filter "Service (regex)" input previously had an issue when services that come alphabetically before the user’s input partially matched the input. For example, if the user typed "Memory," a service named "App Memory 1" would appear before it alphabetically. When an exact match for the input existed—such as a service named exactly "Memory"—the user’s input selection would disappear. Instead, the first service from the list was selected automatically, causing confusion.

To resolve this, the results are now ordered to show the exact match first, followed by services that start with the user input string, and then the rest. This change ensures the exact match always appears at the top of the list, making it easier to find and select the intended service without duplicates.
