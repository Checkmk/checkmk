The welcome page replaces the empty dashboard in new Checkmk installations,
providing interactive onboarding steps tailored to each edition.

The welcome page appears automatically as the default landing page for new users.
It guides them through essential configuration tasks such as adding hosts,
setting up notifications, and configuring basic monitoring rules.
Users can track their progress as they complete each step.

Users can also access the welcome page through the main menu’s help section and
via a sidebar snapin. The sidebar snapin shows the current progress and opens
the wizard steps in a slide-out panel, allowing users to switch contexts easily.

Individual users can set whether the welcome page serves as their default
start page in their personal settings. Alternatively, a "don’t show again"
checkbox at the bottom of the welcome page allows users to easily opt out.
