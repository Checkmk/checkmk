PDF reports now fix missing glyphs by adding the option to select the Vera font.
Vera is bundled with reportlab, which is already included in Checkmk,
so no additional installation is required.

Users can select the Vera font in PDF report settings to prevent missing characters,
significantly improving report readability.
