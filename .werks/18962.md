Previously, the NetApp System Time computed the difference between the agent and system time as a signed difference.
This meant when the system time was behind the agent time, the time difference became negative.
Since only upper levels can be configured for the time difference, synchronization errors were not detected in this case.

Now the absolute time difference between agent and system time is monitored, meaning time synchronization issues are detected regardless of whether the system time is ahead of or behind the agent time.
