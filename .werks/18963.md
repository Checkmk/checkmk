This werk is relevant for you if you are using a Checkmk version containing werk [#17770](https://checkmk.com/werk/17770).
Due to too restrictive filtering of the incoming data, the following services may have not been receiving data:

 - aws_s3
 - aws_elbv2_application_target_groups_http
 - aws_elbv2_application_target_groups_lambda
 - aws_dynamodb_table

With this werk, this has been fixed.
