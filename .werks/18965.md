Previously it was not possible within the ruleset API to modify shipped rulesets that did not conform to the API yet.

With this Werk, a new ruleset of the same name as the legacy ruleset can be now placed under `local/lib/python3/cmk/plugins/{family_name}/rulesets` and will take precedence over the legacy ruleset.
This is consistent with how agent based plugins are handled.
