This werk is relevant for you if you are a plugin developer using validation functions within the ruleset API.

Several ruleset API v1 FormSpecs did not trigger any validation when using the `custom_validate` field, allowing invalid input to be accepted.
The following FormSpecs were affected:

* `BooleanChoice`
* `CascadingSingleChoice`
* `FixedValue`
* `HostState`
* `Metric`
* `MonitoredHost`
* `MonitoredService`
* `Password`
* `Proxy`
* `ServiceState`
* `TimePeriod`


No shipped rulesets could be identified as affected.

Configurations made with affected rulesets (e.g. provided by MKPs) will now become invalid and must be adjusted manually.
