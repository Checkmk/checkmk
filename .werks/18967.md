With [Werk #18964](https://checkmk.com/werk/18964) only passwords from the passwordstore can be used for the OTel receiver authentication.
However, since the password IDs are used to provide the passwords as environment variables to the collector, additional limitations now apply to the IDs.
Only IDs containing letters, digits and underscores are allowed in the receiver configuration.
