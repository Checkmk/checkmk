Abandoned discovered host labels files are now cleaned up on all sites, including remote and standalone ones.

When a host is removed, its corresponding file under `<site>/var/check_mk/discovered_host_labels/` should also be deleted.
If this cleanup does not occur, outdated files accumulate, leading to increased disk usage, especially in dynamic environments with frequently changing hosts.

Previously, abandoned files on central sites within distributed setups were cleaned up.
This werks extends the cleanup to all sites, ensuring consistent removal of outdated label files every hour.
