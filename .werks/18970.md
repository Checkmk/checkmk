The OpenTelemetry collector previously required a manual restart whenever a password used in its configuration was changed or deleted in order for the changes to take effect in the collector.

Now, when you save or apply configuration changes that include password updates, the OpenTelemetry collector automatically applies these changes without needing a manual restart.
