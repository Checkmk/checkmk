Checkmk did not alert when normally closed contacts opened
because the open state was always considered OK.

Checkmk now respects each sensor’s configured state settings.
The Checkmk state for a sensor depends directly on the configuration defined within that sensor.

For example, if a sensor’s normal state is set to "closed", an "open" state will be reported as
invalid, and vice versa. This ensures alerts accurately reflect the sensor’s intended behavior,
reducing false positives and false negatives.

Additionally, Checkmk now uses the severity defined in the sensor configuration instead of a
static default severity.

Review sensor configurations and alert rules to ensure alignment;
no manual action is required unless alert patterns change unexpectedly.
