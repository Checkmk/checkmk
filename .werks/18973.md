Previously the plugin crashed when the Agent reported "no Resources" without providing other resource details. This issue caused interruptions in monitoring.

The plugin now reports the explicit "no Resources" status from the Agent as `OK`. This change prevents crashes and ensures stable monitoring without requiring any user action.
