The Windows agent replaces spaces, tabs, carriage returns, and newlines in volume names with underscores to prevent corruption in the df section output.

Previously, volume names containing tabs, carriage returns, or newlines caused parsing issues.

With this fix, filesystem monitoring is more reliable, and the Checkmk site correctly parses all volume labels containing these special characters.

To apply this fix, update the Checkmk agent on all monitored Windows hosts to the latest agent version.
