Before this fix the REST API endpoints to configure notification parameters, i.e. `check_mk/api/1.0/objects/configuration_entity/*`, lacked proper validation of user permissions.
As a result, these endpoints could be invoked any **authenticated user**, even if they didn't have the `notification_plugin.*` permissions, potentially allowing them to obtain sensitive information or modify with notification templates.

The appropriate permissions are now required and documented in the REST API documentation.

This vulnerability was identified in a commissioned penetration test conducted by PS Positive Security GmbH.
