It is now possible to configure the Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for the site certificate.
This facilitates proper server name validation for incoming TLS connections.

We recommend configuring this setting if you use the OpenTelemetry collector: providing the site's correct host name allows instrumented applications connecting to the collector to properly validate the server name.
Without this setting, clients would be required to ignore server name mismatches.

Additionally, this setting may be required if your organization enforces matching certificates and host names within your network.

Note that, in distributed monitoring setups, this option should be configured individually for each site from the distributed monitoring menu to ensure each site has a unique name.
