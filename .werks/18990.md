We have added support for the **Authority Key Identifier (AKI)** extension to our certificate generation logic. This X.509 extension provides a clearer link between a certificate and the specific key pair of the Certificate Authority (CA) that signed it, improving the reliability of certificate chain verification.

Every new certificate created within Checkmk will automatically include this property.
