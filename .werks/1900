Title: mk_oracle: added oracle session environment
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1427649985
Class: feature

The plugin set some session parameters after login to Oracle. This is useful
for environments with very special init.ora parameters which caused some
performance problems in mk_oracle.

The new function could be disabled with the following parameter in mk_oracle.cfg:
<tt>DISABLE_ORA_SESSION_SETTINGS=1</tt>
