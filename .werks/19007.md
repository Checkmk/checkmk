Checkmk Pro 2.5 (formerly Enterprise) requires a valid license to operate.

Updates are blocked if the system is unlicensed or the license has expired, preventing licensed users from being downgraded to the trial or free version.
When an update is blocked, users will see an error message explaining the issue and the site will prevent the update from happening, keeping the system in a clean state, as it was before the update started.

To proceed with the update, ensure that a valid, non-expired license is installed. After installing the license, you will need to restart the update process.
