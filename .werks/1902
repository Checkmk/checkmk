Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1427651517
Class: feature

There are some environments with performance issues in RMAN check. There is
a known issue from Oracle regarding deleted objects in the controlfile of
the database. See Note 465378.1 in MyOracleSupport for details.

Another solution is adding a hint in the SQL statement. This werk adds the
function to insert the hint with a variable in <tt>mk_oracle.cfg</tt>. Please
add the following entry:
<tt>HINT_RMAN="+RULE"</tt>
