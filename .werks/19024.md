Activating changes on sites with many regex-based service state translations and thousands of services previously caused delays of up to a minute, slowing down the processing time and impacting workflow responsiveness. 

This fix significantly improves performance on larger sites, restoring activation times to more reasonable levels. Users do not need to take any manual action to benefit from this enhancement.
