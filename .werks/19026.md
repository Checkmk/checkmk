NGINX web server (Linux) agent plugin now supports IPv6 addresses.

Previously they could not be configured via the GUI and checks using IPv6 addresses (either due to auto-detection or manual configuration) failed.

With this update, users can configure IPv6 addresses for the NGINX agent plugin via the GUI without encountering errors. Checks using IPv6 addresses will now succeed automatically after the update, requiring no additional action.
