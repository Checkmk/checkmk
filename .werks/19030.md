The "Remote alert handlers (Linux)" previously exposed SSH private keys in the HTML source of the rule page. Knowledge of the private key would allow them to trigger the configured alert handlers on affected hosts. Since the specific alert handlers that can be run with the key are strictly defined in the `authorized_keys` file, no further access beyond this would be possible. The issue is now fixed.

This vulnerability was found during internal review.

*Who's Affected*:

All configurations using the Remote alert handlers (Linux) rule in all editions are affected.

Validate the alert handler key is no longer present in the host's `authorized_keys` file.
