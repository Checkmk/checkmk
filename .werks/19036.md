Host configuration now validates the DNS name or IP address by performing a basic ping check immediately when adding or editing a host.

Previously, administrators had to input the exact DNS name or IP address of a host, and any errors were only detected later—such as on the service discovery page—when the host was unreachable.

With this new option, users are alerted right away if the DNS name or IP address cannot be reached, preventing misconfiguration and saving time by catching errors early. No additional action is required beyond entering the host details as usual.
