The agent installation slideout enables direct agent download and installation
during host setup. It guides administrators through the installation process and
verifies whether the correct steps have been completed. This improvement
simplifies and speeds up the workflow by allowing installation and connection
checks to be done directly within the host setup pages.

Previously, when setting up hosts, the agent connection was tested for the
first time on the service discovery page. If the agent connection was not
successful, administrators had to manually download, install, and retest the
agent connection separately.

Currently, the slideout is available on the host creation and editing page,
as well as on the service discovery page.
