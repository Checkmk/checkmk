Email plug-ins now offer a new authentication option using Microsoft GraphAPI.
This method provides a modern way to access Exchange Online mailboxes.

Because Microsoft will deprecate Exchange Web Services (EWS) in October 2026,
users must switch to the GraphAPI authentication before that date to ensure
continued functionality of email plug-ins.

The new GraphAPI authentication requires a UI-based workflow. You can configure
it either directly within the plug-in’s ruleset or by creating a
new OAuth2 connection on the `Setup > OAuth2 connections` page.

This authentication grants temporary access for 24 hours, which refreshes
automatically whenever the API is requested. However, after 24 hours of
inactivity, users must re-authenticate via the UI to restore access.

Failure to do so will prevent the email plug-in from accessing Exchange Online mailboxes.
