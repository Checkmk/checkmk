Diagnostics dump now collects files from
 - ~/etc/omd
 - ~/etc/apache
 - /etc/apache2
 - /etc/httpd
 - /omd/apache

This enhancement improves troubleshooting by automatically including additional configuration data when creating diagnostics dumps. As a result, users and support staff can more easily identify configuration issues without needing to manually gather these files. This change is fully transparent and requires no action from users.
