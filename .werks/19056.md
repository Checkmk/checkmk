This werk improves two aspects:

1. Support diagnostics page inline help now provides a clearer overview regarding sensitivity. The
definitions of the "High," "Medium," "Low" sensitivity categories are thoroughly documented, helping
users better understand how data is classified. A new category "Unknown" was introduced to describe
files that result from 3rd-party and customer extensions.

2. Sensitivity categories have been reworked, and the sensitivity levels of some files have been adjusted accordingly.
