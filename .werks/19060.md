The summary and details of clustered services were perceived as verbose and difficult to read.

This werk introduces the following changes:

* The aggregation mode and preferred node are included in the detail text.
* Instead of prefixing every line with the host name a header line precedes the node results.
* Every node result contains a state marker (if the state is not OK).


In order to benefit from this change, users are not required to take manual action.
