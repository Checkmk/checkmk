While updating the DNS cache, Checkmk performed DNS queries also for hosts with statically configured IP addresses.
This was caused by an erroneous swap of dictionaries containing the configured IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the call stack.

This werk removes the swap such that no DNS query is executed for  hosts with a configured IP address.

To benefit from this fix, no manual interaction is required.
