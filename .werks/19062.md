Different check plugins may have the same service description. 
Werk 6708 introduced a fix that prevented the creation of "Disabled services", if one plugin that created such a duplicate service description was disabled via the "Disabled checks" rule.
This previous fix caused another issue: Users were not able to mark services as disabled on the service discovery page.

With this change, the service selected by the user gets excluded from the previous fix, i.e. no unwanted rules get created, but a rule for the explicitly selected service gets created.
