Werk 17075 introduced a fix that prevented expressions from becoming invalid during concatenation when they contained global flags.

However, this fix was not applied everywhere. 
The "Check_MK Discovery" was still affected and would show a UNKN state with this error message:
 
"Invalid regular expression '...': global flags not at the start of the expression at position 1"

Now, the fix from werk 17075 is also applied for periodic service discovery. 
No manual interaction is required to benefit from this fix.
