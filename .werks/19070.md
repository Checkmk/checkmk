An HTTP(S) proxy server for online license verification can now be configured in License settings.

Sites that require the use of a proxy server for outbound HTTP(S) traffic can
now be configured appropriately in Checkmk UI under Setup -> Maintenance ->
Licensing.

Previously such sites had to resort to offline verification, configuring proxy
servers via environment variables, or making exceptions to network policies.

No configuration changes are necessary to existing sites, even if they had been
using environment variables `http_proxy`/`https_proxy` (and similar). These
environment variables will still be honoured, unless explicitly overridden in
Checkmk settings.
