Checkmk 2.5 introduces a [new backend](https://checkmk.com/werk/18906) for storing and querying OpenTelemetry metrics.
Building on this, the [custom graph editor](https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/graphing.html#custom_graphs) now includes an additional configuration section that allows users to add OpenTelemetry metrics for visualization and monitoring.
Note that this section is only displayed if the backed is enabled.

Users can select metric names and configure attribute-based filters through the new dialogue.
The resulting time series are displayed as lines in the custom graph: gauges render as-is, sums as rates, and histograms as configurable percentiles.

Once a metric is added to the custom graph, a monitoring button becomes available.
This button opens a slide-in interface to configure a special agent rule.
After saving and activating this rule, the host to which it applies will discover additional services — one for each matching time series.

This workflow enables users to explore, visualize, and monitor OpenTelemetry metrics stored in the new backend directly within Checkmk.
It complements the DCD-based monitoring of OpenTelemetry metrics described in [Werk 19075](https://checkmk.com/werk/19075).
