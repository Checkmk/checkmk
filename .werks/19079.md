The _Check HTTP web service_ active check now supports the use of macros in fixed strings configured to be searched within the response body.
This feature is supported by the deprecated _Check HTTP service (deprecated)_ active check and as of this werk also by its replacement.
This enhancement allows users to create more dynamic and flexible HTTP checks that automatically adapt to the host context without requiring manual updates.
For example, you can configure the macro `$HOSTNAME$` to search the response body for the name of the host to which the service is assigned.
Existing checks will immediately benefit from this feature once the macros are included in the configuration.
