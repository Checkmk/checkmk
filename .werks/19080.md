The "Event Summary" for bulk notifications always showed the same host for
every entry, even when the bulk contained notifications for different hosts.

This happened because the bulk summary was generated using the context of the
first notification in the bulk.

This issue has been fixed.

Furthermore, the actual event date is now also used for bulk notifications,
just as it has been for single notifications since Werk #18861.
