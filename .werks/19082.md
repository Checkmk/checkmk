Starting with version 2.4.0, the HTML email notification parameters no longer
included the “Notification author” and “Notification comment” options in the
“Additional details” section. These options control whether author and comment
information is included in notification emails, and their absence may have
reduced the clarity of notifications for users.

This functionality has now been restored. The “Notification author” and
“Notification comment” options have been re-added to the HTML email
notification parameters.

If you are using HTML email notifications and noticed these options were
missing since version 2.4.0, please review your notification settings after
upgrading. You may need to reconfigure your parameters to ensure that both
options are enabled and included in your notification emails.
