In some cases, the user settings for the parent scan could not be loaded
correctly, leading to a generic error message. This werk improves the error
handling to provide a more informative message, helping users understand the
issue and how to resolve it.

If you encounter this error in previous versions, please delete the file
'~/var/check_mk/web/USERNAME/parentscan.mk' and visit the parent scan page
again.
