The JSON cache file handling for files located at '~/tmp/check_mk/json_cache/' was fixed to prevent the error:

```
json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
```

Previously, if the cache file was missing, this error could occur, potentially causing the special agent to fail.
With this fix, the system now handles missing cache files gracefully and recovers automatically without requiring any user intervention.
