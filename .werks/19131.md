When multiple different instances of Checkmk run on the same host, each instance uses the self-monitoring data (e.g. Processes or OS Services) provided by the other instances.
This data is then interpreted by the used instance to display Checkmk services for all installed instances.
Differences in the format of the otel-collector self-monitoring data across versions caused service failures and generated crash reports.

This release introduces a more robust, backward- and forward-compatible format for the otel-collector self-monitoring data.
This new format can be correctly read by multiple Checkmk versions, preventing such failures and improving overall system stability.
As a result, users running multiple Checkmk versions on the same host will no longer experience service failures or crash reports related to otel-collector self-monitoring data format differences, without needing to take any manual action.

Data created by versions before this werk will not create a service anymore in versions with this werk applied and existing services will vanish.
