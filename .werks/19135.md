Due to some miscommunication wrong OIDs have been provided.
This werk replaces werk [#19130](https://checkmk.com/werk/19130).
The OIDs have been corrected and Standalone and Clustered Devices are now correctly identified.

Stormshield products updating to firmware version 4.8 have changed their OID. 
Detect all Stormshield products by using a more general OID starting with their enterprise OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.11256.1
