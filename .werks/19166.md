This Werk renames the "Enable/disable active checks for services" rule
to "Enable/disable active checks for services (Nagios core)".

This change clarifies that the rule only applies when the Nagios core is
used. The help text is expanded to reflect this as well.

If the Checkmk Micro Core is used, this rule has no effect at all.
