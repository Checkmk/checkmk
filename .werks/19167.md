Checkmk 2.5 features an updated way to display forms when editing
rulesets. All rulesets implemented using the `cmk.rulesets.v1` API will
automatically take advantage of this new feature.

Rules that have not been migrated to the `cmk.rulesets.v1` API will
still have their edit page updated to use the new form rendering for the
rule properties and conditions. The rule value section in the middle
will remain as it has been in previous versions.

Here's what has changed with the new form rendering:

* Multiple validation errors can now be reported at once. Previously, we
  would only display the first error when more than one error existed.
* Validation errors are displayed right next to the input element,
  giving you more context about needs to be changed where.
* Help texts can now be accessed by clicking an ℹ️ button next to the
  parameter title. These buttons are visible when you haven't enabled
  the inline help from the page menu. The previous inline help behavior
  remains unchanged.
* Various spacing and styling issues have been addressed.
* The data format has been streamlined reduce the amount of data
  transferred when saving a form. This increases stability when dealing
  with large rulesets.
