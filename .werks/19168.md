When creating a new dynamic host management connection with the
piggyback connector type, any edit to custom attributes in the form
would not be stored correctly.

When editing such a connection, any custom attribute value set would
show up empty.

If you have previously configured a dynamic host connection with custom
host attributes, review its configuration after this Werk has been
applied. The configuration will now be displayed as it has been used and
will be updated correctly when saved.
