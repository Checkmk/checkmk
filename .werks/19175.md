Queries on the _hosts_ and _services_ tables that use filters on columns such as _labels_ or _custom_values_ could experience significant performance degradation when many rows were involved. Users might have noticed slow queries or delays when filtering on these columns.

With this fix, the performance of filters on _labels_ and _custom_values_ is now much closer to that of regular columns, resulting in faster and more efficient queries. This improvement enhances your workflow without requiring any manual intervention.
