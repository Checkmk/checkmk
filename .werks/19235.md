The `pfsense_counter` plugin was fixed to correctly display actual rate values in the service output instead of format placeholders.
This correction ensures that users now see precise rate measurements, improving readability and monitoring accuracy.
For example, instead of showing "Packets that matched a rule: %.2f pkts," the service output now properly displays values like "Packets that matched a rule: 42.06 pkts".
