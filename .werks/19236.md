The Robotmk scheduler on Windows hosts could crash due to incorrect handling of long Windows paths.
This caused errors when resetting permissions, preventing plans from being scheduled.
An example error message is:
```
ERROR [robotmk_scheduler::setup::steps::api] src\bin\scheduler\setup\steps\api.rs:71: Plan my-test: Failed to reset permissions of C:\robotmk\rcc_home. Plan won't be scheduled.
Caused by: Resetting permissions of C:\robotmk\rcc_home failed
```
This crash results in tests not being scheduled, impacting monitoring reliability.

To resolve this issue and restore normal operation, users must update the agent on all affected Windows hosts.
