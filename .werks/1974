Title: Event console views were randomly ignoring host filters

Sometimes the event console views were accessed with a host filter,
for example using the name of a host. The view was showing events
which did not belong to this host. After reloading the page, the
view was showing a correctly filtered list again. This behaviour has
been fixed.
