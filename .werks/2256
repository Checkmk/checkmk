Title: mk_mysql: MySQL monitoring is now available for windows
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1432218553
Class: feature

The mk_mysql plugin which already existed for some time has been
ported to Windows. It is now available as windows agent plugin.
You can use the exact same checks as on linux hosts. To make the
agent plugin working, you need to configure the credentials
to access the database just like on linux systems with the
difference that the configuration file needs to be placed in
the directory of the <tt>check_mk_agent.exe</tt> and named
<tt>mysql.ini</tt>. In case you have multiple instances running
on a single host and need different credentials, you can create
multiple files named <tt>mysql_<instance>.ini</tt> while you need
to replace instance with the ident of the mysql process.
