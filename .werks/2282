Title: mkeventd: fixed exception in notification if the application field of the event was not set
Level: 2

Events without an properly set <i>application</i> field were not processed correctly
by the Check_MK notification module. By nature, all events from the event console
are always considered as service events. If the <i>application</i> field is empty
the event was processed as host event, which lead to an exception.
