Title: Skip unmonitored hosts during bulk discovery

Class: feature

Hosts that are set to <i>unmonitored</i> (usually using the selection <i>Do not monitor this host</i>
in the host tag group <i>Criticality</i>) are now being skipped during bulk discovery. This now behaves
the same like <i>cmk -I</i> on the command line.
