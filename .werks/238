Title: vsphere monitoring: new option to skip placeholder vms in agent output
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: feature

When using a Site Recovery Manager (SRM) some of the virtualmachines are only
used as fallback. The new agent_vsphere option -p allows to suppress any output
regarding placeholder vms.
Right now this option only works when querying a host system.
Placeholder vms are identified by not having an assigned VirtualDisk Device.
The option is also configurable via the WATO rule "Check state of VMWare ESX via vSphere"
