Title: Fixed quoting of ! in classical nagios checks configured via WATO
Level: 1

Class: fix

Any <i>!</i> character configured in the WATO rule <i>Classical active and passive Monitoring checks</i>
or through the command line via custom_checks was incorrectly quoted. Nagios truncated the command
at the !, which lead to unwanted results.
