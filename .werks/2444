Title: lnx_if: now able to detect interfaces which "break" during runtime
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b1

Class: feature

Previously the check <i>lnx_if</i> used the output of the <i>ethtool</i> command to determine if
an interface is up or down. There was a fallback in case <i>ethtool</i> was not available,
or did not report valid data at all (happens on broken interfaces).
However, these fallback could not detect interfaces which break during runtime.

The linux agent now reports additional information collected with the <i>ip link</i> command.
In case the ethtool information is missing the <i>lnx_if</i> check will now use the
data from <i>ip link</i> instead.
