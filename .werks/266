Title: windows_agent: now supports mrpe include files
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1390577245
Class: feature

This version introduces the mrpe configuration option <tt>include</tt>.
With this option you can define addiontal include files and the user domain in
which include files should be executed.

F+:check_mk.ini
[mrpe]
    # Run classical Nagios plugins. The word before the command
    # line is the service description for Nagios. Use backslashes
    # in Windows-paths.
    check = Dummy mrpe\check_crit
    check = IP_Configuration mrpe\check_ipconfig 1.2.3.4
    check = Whatever c:\myplugins\check_whatever -w 10 -c 20
    # Additional mrpe configs
    # The include files can be changed during the runtime
    include \\ab = C:\includes\ab_mrpe.cfg
    include \\NT-AUTORITÄT\SYSTEM = C:\includes\system_mrpe.cfg
    # If you omit the user the file is executed with the current user
    include = C:\includes\default.cfg
F-:

The syntax in the mrpe include file is the same as in the mrpe section, with the exception
that you cannot add further includes in a include file. There is also no need to define a <tt>[mrpe]</tt>
section in an included file. You just need to define the <tt>check</tt> lines here.
F+:ab_mrpe.cfg
    check = Dummy mrpe\check_crit
    check = IP_Configuration mrpe\check_ipconfig 1.2.3.4
F-:
<b>Important:</b> Keep in mind that the agent needs the permission to run
scripts as other user. Internally it uses the windows command <tt>runas /User:</tt>
which prompts for a password if agent has no permission to change to this user.<br>
In this case the check_mk agent will get stuck!
