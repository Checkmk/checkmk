Title: windows agent: fixed inventory running every time when ipv6 was activated
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

due to the colons in ipv6 adresses, the state file used to signal when inventory was last executed
couldn't be saved. This has been fixed both in the ps1 and vbs variant of the script.
