Title: Fix problem that no site is configured when user has deleted only site
Level: 2
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b1

Class: fix

This problem was introduced by dropping the "single site" mode internally totally
in version 1.2.7i3 and treating a single site setup automatically as multi site
setup with just one site. The problem occurred when you had <tt>sites = {}</tt>
in your configuration (instead of having no <tt>sites = </tt> at all).
