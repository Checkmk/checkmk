When configuring dynamic levels, e.g. for filesystems, if you configure the dynamic levels 
for example like this:

larger than 100GB: 90% WARN / 95% CRIT
larger than 1TB: 95% WARN / 98% CRIT

This will result in all filesystems smaller than 100GB in always being OK. This was confusing
users. The validation of these rules has now been changed to enforce creation of an entry
for filesystems larger than 0 bytes.
