The assignment of Event Console events to contact groups is a bit more
flexible now. There is a new global option in <i>User Interface</i> called
<i>Precedence of contact groups of events</i>. The default setting is <i>Host's
contact groups have precedence</i> and implements the previos behaviour. You
now can change that to <i>Contact groups in rule have precedence</i>.
This handles the case where an event can successfully be mapped to a host
in the monitoring while there are specified explicit contact groups in the
event rule. Those will have then precedence and not only be used as a fall
back. That way you can explicitely assign events to arbitrary contact groups
and by that way control the visibility. Note: this has now influence on
notification.
