Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown

In the check output and the WATO texts for its configuration the words <i>provisioning</i>
and <i>over provisioning</i> where mixed up. This has been fixed. Also in the output
performance data the levels for WARN and CRIT have been corrected. Thanks to Marten
Vanraes.
