Title: SNMP: Generalized error handling of emtpy info for SNMP checks
Level: 2
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b1
Date: 1446828681
Class: fix

This change changes the way empty data for SNMP checks is handled.
In previous version each SNMP check had to deal with the fact that
the SNMP agent could respond with an empty response (info = []).

This situation can better be handled in the Check_MK SNMP engine
which catches this issue now before calling the discovery/check
function of the check. The error is then reported as missing info
like for the Check_MK Agent based checks.

There might be some special SNMP checks which need to treat this
case of empty data on its own. These checks now need to declare
the attribute <tt>handle_empty_info</tt> in the <tt>check_info</tt>.
