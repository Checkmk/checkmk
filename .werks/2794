Title: The encoding parameter set in the agent sections was not working

Class: fix

You can configure the encoding of agent sections with the additional section parameter
<i>encoding(cp437)</i>, e.g. `<<<mycheck:sep(9):encoding(cp437)>>>`.
This feature was broken, due to some code restructuring a few months ago.
