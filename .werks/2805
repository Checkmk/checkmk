Title: ps: Now able to monitor processes which contain + characters
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b1
Date: 1449067758
Class: fix

Any + character in process name, e.g <i>asm_diag_+ASM1</i> was interpreted
as regular expression special character.

Such processes could be found during the service discovery.
The check function however, was unable to find this process again, because
of the incorrect escaped + character.
