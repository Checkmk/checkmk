Title: WATO rule based notifications: Validate regular expression for service conditions
Level: 1
Component: notifications
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b1
Date: 1450446173
Class: fix

The rule based notification conditions <i>Match only the following services</i> and
<i>Exclude the following services<i> were unabled to detect invalid regular expression.

An invalid regular expression causes an exception during the notification processing,
which ultimately leads to the loss of any notification running through this broken rule.
