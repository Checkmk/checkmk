Title: Fixed cleanup of old autocheck files of cluster hosts
Level: 1
Component: core
Class: fix

The autocheck entries of clustered services were stored in
[cluster].mk autocheck files in past versions. Current versions
are now storing the autochecks in the node specific files.

The old [cluster].mk files were not cleaned up during discovery
leading into duplicate autochecks entries. As these files were
never updated again, they could result in unwanted services on
the cluster hosts. This could be fixed manually by removing the
[cluster].mk autocheck files via command line.

The current version is now cleaning up the files during discovery.
