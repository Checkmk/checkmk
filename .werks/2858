Title: hp_proliant_da_phydrv: Adding disk controller to check items
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.8b1
Date: 1449067943
Class: fix

Older checks were not taking the controller number into account which
was resulting in missing service checks for some disks. We have now
added the controller id to the check item to fix this issue.

You will have to rediscover the affected hosts and eventually update
related rules like disabled services or similar since the service
description is now changed, for example from "HW Phydrv 0" to "HW Phydrv 0/0".
