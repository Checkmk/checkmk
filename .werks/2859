The Check_MK services "Check_MK Discovery", "Check_MK Inventory" and "Check_MK HW/SW Inventory" need
data from the Check_MK agent on agent based hosts. These check were contacting the agent on their own
on every execution which could lead to logwatch messages not being processed by the agent because they
were already processed by the discovery/inventory checks.

We now set these checks to use the agent cache (if available and if recent enough). This makes the
checks only contact the agent when neccessary. This should never happen when the host is being monitored
regularly because the regular monitoring ensures that the cache is available and up-to-date.
