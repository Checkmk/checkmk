Title: wagner_titanus_topsens: added support for more devices
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b1
Date: 1448353301
Class: feature

The supported devices are both topsens-es, but different variants. The main difference seems to be
that one has a LSN (Local Security Network) interface and one doesn't.
