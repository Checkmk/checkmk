Title: fortigate_memory_base: added check for fortigate firewall memory usage
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b1
Date: 1448523674
Class: feature

The fortigate_memory check uses data provided by a more "generic" fortinet mib, this one uses the
fortigate mib. Apparently a device provides only one of the two mibs so there shouldn't be a
collision.
