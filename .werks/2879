Title: WATO-Replication of MKPs and files in the local/ hierarchy
Level: 2
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b1
Date: 1450427671
Class: feature

Distributed WATO now offers a new checkbox <i>Replicate extensions (MKPs and
files in ~/local/)</i> in the settings of a site. When you check this then
all MKP extension packages and files below the <tt>~/local/</tt> filesystem
on the site will be replicated to the slaves. Note: existing files and MKPs
on the slave will be removed, so you have an exact replication.

Extension replication is activated per default now if you create a new
site connection. Your existing connections are not touched so this is a
compatible change.

Extension replication only works with CEE and CRE. Manual setups
(<tt>./setup.sh</tt>) are not supported.
