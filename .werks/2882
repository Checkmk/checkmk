Title: Reorganize BI configuration into packs, add contacts and permissions

Class: feature

The WATO module for configuring Business Intelligence (BI) has been
reorganized. The configuration is now split up into <b>Packs</b>. This has
been made for two reasons:

LI:It makes the configuration of large BI environments easier
LI:It allows to delegate BI configuration to normal users

Each pack contains rules and aggregations. A rule or aggregation in one pack
<b>can</b> refer to rules in another pack.

Each BI pack can have a list of contact groups. A new permission has been
introduced: <i>Business Intelligence Rules and Aggregations</i>.  Per default
this is set for normal users. It allows a normal user to configure rules
and aggregations in a BI pack if that user is in one of the listed contact
groups of that pack.

A pack can have the checkbox <i>Allow all users to refer to rules contained
in this pack</i> set. That way a user can use rule from a pack where he is
not a contact for. So the admin can put some basic rules there that can be
used but not changed by other.

Your existing BI configuration will automatically be converted the next
time you use the WATO Bi modul. All existing rules and aggregations will
be put in to one BI pack with the name <i>Default Pack</i>.
