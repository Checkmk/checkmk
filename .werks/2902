Title: Hosts can now be added by regular network scans of configured IP ranges

For each WATO folder a new attribute <i>Network Scan</i> can now be configured.
This network scan will ping all IP addresses in all configured IP ranges in the
configured interval for new reachable hosts / IP addresses.

When such a network scan of a folder discovers a new host, the discovery mechanism
tries to resolve the host name via DNS. If found, it uses the DNS name as hostname.
Otherwise the IP address will be used as host name. Then it will be created as new
host and added to this folder.

Hosts found by the network scan are added as disabled host. You can enable monitoring
of these hosts by setting the <i>Criticality</i> host tag of this host to another
value. Additionally you may want to configure other attributes like the agent type
of this host before adding it to your regular monitoring.

If you want to exclude a found host from your monitoring, add the IP address to the
list of excluded IP addresses and then delete the found host from this folder.

The result of a network scan is written to the <i>Last Scan Result</i> attribute
of a folder. So if you like to know when the last scan for a folder was performed,
take a look at that folders properties.

If you experience issues with the network scan, take a look at the log of the Web GUI
(<tt>var/log/web.log</tt>).
