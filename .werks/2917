Title: cisco_asa_failover: Will no longer discover on devices where failover is disabled
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b1
Date: 1452591537
Class: fix

If failover is disabled on a device, both primary and secondary units are reported as "down".
check_mk reported a warning for that even though there was no problem.
This change requires re-inventory of the affected devices.
