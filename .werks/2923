This is due to security. SNMP communities are basically passwords and should
not be shown in plaintext in the GUI. Of course this change makes it harder
to read existing rules. If that is a problem for you then you can add the
plaintext community to the comment field of a rule. Alas - security is always
linked with inconveniance...
