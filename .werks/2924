In WATO in a host or folder you can assign contact groups to hosts.
The new checkbox <i>Always add host contact groups also to its services</i>
allows you now to also assign these groups to the services of the host.
Here is some explanation from the online help:

<i>With this option contact groups that are added to hosts are always being
added to services, as well. This only makes a difference if you have assigned
other contact groups to services via rules in Host & Service Parameters. As
long as you do not have any such rule a service always inherits all contact
groups from its host.</i>
