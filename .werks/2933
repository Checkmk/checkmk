Title: openhardwaremonitor, check_mk_agent.windows: added agent support and check for monitoring hardware sensors through OpenHardwareMonitor
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b1
Date: 1453211015
Class: feature

The agent will now automatically pick up data from OHM if it's running OR if check_mk's own stripped
down headless version of OHM is installed.
In the latter case the agent will automatically start and stop OHM as needed.
Data is retrieved through wmi.
