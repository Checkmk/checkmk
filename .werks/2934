Title: all temperature checks rewritten to use the shared temperature api
Level: 3
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.8b1
Date: 1453300152
Class: feature

Over 100 checks were touched in this update. For most of these
checks it won't be necessary to re-inventorize but once you do,
item names on many checks will change.

Service descriptions have also been normalized but to ease the
transition from existing setups, the old service description will
continue to show on existing installations.

If you have an existing installation and would like to switch to
the new service descriptions you can toggle them in:
Global Settings->Execution of checks->Use new service descriptions

Finally, all temperature checks can now be configured through the
same rule (called "Temperature", who would've thunk) and support the
same features (like configurable unit, support for trend computations,
upper and lower thersholds and so on).
Unfortunately this means that most existing rules for temperature
checks will no longer be applied and disappear from the
Host&Service Parameter list.
Please make sure you carry over all important temperature rules!

You can still see the now deprecated rules through the
button "Deprecated Rulesets" in Host&Service Parameters.
