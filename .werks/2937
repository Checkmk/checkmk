mrpe services can now contain any character using percent encoding. This is particularly useful to
include spaces in the service description as that was previously impossible due to the way mrpe.cfg
was parsed.
This change is incompatible as any %xx sequence will now be converted whereas it was previously
included in the service description as unchanged.
