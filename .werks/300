Title: cisco_fru_power: Trying not to inventorize not plugged in FRUs
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.4b1
Date: 1386259723
Class: fix

In the previous version, the check did inventorize all FRUs reported
by the device. The devices also send information for slots which have
no FRU plugged in. This change tries to ignore all not plugged in slots.
