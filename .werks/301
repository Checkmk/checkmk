Title: Handling messages of special syslog format correctly

The syslog RFCs allow different formats of syslog messages. The
message parsing code in the event console does support several
formats and should be able to deal with all formats allowed by
the specifications. However, one format was not supported in
past versions. Those messages were simply dropped and only seen
in the logs of the event console, when rule execution debugging
is enabled.

These log entries look as follows:

<tt><5>SYSTEM_INFO: [WLAN-1] Performing Background Scan : channel 12, active, 28 TU</tt>

The specific part here is the missing date/time and missing hostname
information, which is sent by most syslog clients. The parser has been
changed to be able to parse this format. The event console adds the
current date/time to the event and the IP address of the sending
client as host information.
