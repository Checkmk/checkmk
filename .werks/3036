The bulk discovery could cause stability issues by consuming too much resources on
the monitoring server. This could be caused in case the single discovery steps take
longer than the configured timeout of the web server service the Check_MK GUI. In
case a request (discovery step) took longer than the request timeout, the browser
request was timing out and the next discovery step was started while the former
discovery process of Check_MK was still running. If this happened multiple times,
like several hundret times, this could consume all system memory and causing a lot
of CPU load which may result in an unstable monitoring server. Only a restart of
the whole sites web server could fix this situation.
