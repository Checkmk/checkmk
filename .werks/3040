Title: Removed all summary_hosts related filters from shipped views

Class: fix

The so called summary hosts which were only rarely used is a feature we are about to deprecate
in the coming 1.2.9 release. As preparation for this we are now removing the hard coded default
filters from the views shipped with Check_MK.

We assume that nearly no users will be affected from this since most users simply don't have
any summary host defined. If you have summary hosts configured you are requested to migrate
your configuration. To make the views work again, most of them were filtering out the summary
hosts, you need to add this filter again on your own to the view by editing it with the view
editor.
