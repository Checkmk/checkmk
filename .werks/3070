To retrieve the list of installed software the mk_inventory.vbs script uses two different approaches
that heavily overlap: One retrieves the list of uninstall-entries from the registry, the other
retrieved the list of installers registered in the windows installer database (via wmi query to
Win32_Product).
The latter list is usually a subset of the former and can take excessively long to query as it
triggers a verification of the database. In the process it also prints a lot of messages to
the event log (see https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/kb/974524).

Therefore the query to Win32_Product has been replaced with a query via a vbs-interface to the
installer database. This should produce the same results without the drawbacks mentioned.
