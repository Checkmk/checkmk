Title: windows agent: agent can now handle utf-16 encoded output from plugins

Class: fix

utf-16 is the default unicode encoding used on windows and appears to be the only one supported as
an output encoding for vbs scripts.
Previously the agent would print an empty string instead of the utf-16 encoded output.
For this to work the plugin/local check has to use a unicode-enabled stdout and print a utf-16 BOM,
i.e.:
Set objStdout = fso.GetStandardStream(1, True)
objStdout.Write(chrW(&HFEFF))
