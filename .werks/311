Title: Fixed "Inventory failed" message when trying an inventory on clusters via WATO

The service inventory of cluster hosts via WATO failed all the time with an error message
like "Inventory failed for this host: Error - host is unreachable, no usable cache file present".
This error has been fixed with this change.
A WATO-inventory on a cluster node also no longer removes previously detected clustered services.
