Title: citrix_status: fixed incorrect assignment of piggyback data to host running the plugin
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.8b10
Date: 1459768772
Class: fix

When a machine is created in citrix without a name, the plugin would previously assign data from
that machine to the one running the plugin.
Those machines will now be ignored by the plugin as their data can't be correctly assigned anyway.
