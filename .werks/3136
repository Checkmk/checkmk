Title: windows agent: improved crash reporting
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1464079421
Class: feature

With crash debug enabled the agent will now report the windows exception code on crash
as well as the address causing the crash and the exact git revision he agent was built
from.
On 64bit systems it will also print a full backtrace including register contents.

Technical details:
Our official builds are built with mingw-w64, so we can't use windows api to resolve
debugging symbols in our own binaryi. These frames will only include addresses, while
api calls are resolved.

However, the agent is now built with dwarf-2 debugging symbols (outdated but better
tool support) and stripped of symbols in a separate build step. With the correct
unstripped exe the adresses can still be resolved using addr2line:

addr2line -e check_mk_agent-64.unstripped.exe &lt;address&gt;
