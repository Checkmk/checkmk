Title: hr_fs printer_supply: Improved translation of wrong encoded chars
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.3i8
Date: 1387184828
Class: fix

Now both checks are using the charset defined in the ruleset <tt>snmp_character_encodings</tt>
for the host to decode strings which might contain umlauts with non utf8 encoding.

Also new: We assume a latin1 encoding by default, when no encoding is configured for a host.
