Title: New header for limiting the execution time of a query

The new Livestatus header Timelimit: sets an upper limit
for the execution time of a query. Specify the timeout as
a number of seconds. The following query will stop after
5000 lines of output. If that takes longer than 30 seconds,
then the query <b>fails with no output</b>:

F+:query.lql
GET log
Columns: message
Timelimit: 30
Limit: 5000
F-:

Please note, that <tt>Limit:</tt> and <tt>Timelimit:</tt> have
a different behaviour when the limit is reached:

<ul>
<li class=list><tt>Limit:</tt> end the query, output all rows that
have been found so far.</li>
<li class=list><tt>Timelimit:</tt> abort the query with an error,
do not output any lines.</li>
</ul>
