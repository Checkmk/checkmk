Title: Better handling of host/service visibility of users with admin role
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1460548346
Class: feature

This change affects only users which have the "general.see_all" permission,
normally Administrators and Guests. But the most affected users will be
the admins.

Previous Check_MK versions had the options {{Visibility of Hosts/Services}}
and {{Visibility of Hosts/Services (Webservice)}} which could be set in
the user profile. These options could be used by all users which have the
"see all" permission to limit the shown hosts and services to only the ones
which they are really a contact for.

The later option has been deprecated now. It was first integrated to make users
of external tools like Nagstamon, which fetches it's list of host and service
problems from the Check_MK webservice, be able to show only the the problems
of their hosts and services.  But this option also had a side effect: When
it is enabled and the option {{Visibility of Hosts/Services}} was not enabled,
the admin could see all hosts/services in the GUI but when executing a CSV
export he was only getting the hosts/services he is a contact for.

To fix this situation we decided to deprecate the
{{Visibility of Hosts/Services (Webservice)}} and replace it with a URL variable
which can be used to filter each page individually. The new URL variable
<tt>force_authuser</tt> can be used on any view and set to:

LI:<tt>1</tt> to show only the hosts/services the user is a contact for
LI:<tt>0</tt> to show all hosts/services
LI:{{username}} to show all hosts/services the given user is a contact for

The now deprecated option will still be working as before but you are
recommended to uncheck the option and use the new mechanism. If you are
using it for Nagstamon you will need to use a Nagstamon 2.0 release newer
than ALPHA-20160307 once it is available.
