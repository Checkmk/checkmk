Title: postgres_stat_database: make agent compatible with PostgreSQL 8.4.x
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.4b1
Date: 1387212475
Class: fix

The SQL query that was used in the agent plugin <tt>mk_postgres</tt>
was not compatible with PostgreSQL 8.4.x, because there is not column
<tt>conflicts</tt>.  This column is not used by the check anyway, so it has
been removed (thanks to Alexander Keller).
