Title: Fixed possible BI exception "Unknown BI aggregation group ..."

Class: fix

An exception has been fixed which could occur when using "multi host" aggregations
together with the "precompile on demand" feature. It could happen that a BI ajax
fold/unfold request was the first BI request in an apache process which had not
yet initialized the BI cache yet.
