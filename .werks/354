Title: Catch exception when check plugins do not return a state
Level: 1

When a broken check plugin does not return a proper state then
Check_MK broke with an exception. This is now better handled.
The check now goes into <i>UNKNOWN</i> state with the message
<tt>Check plugin did not return any result</tt>.
