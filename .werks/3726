Title: Web API: Fixed default output format - using JSON as intended
Level: 2
Component: wato

Class: fix

The WATO Web API was using Python as default output format since version
1.2.8b8 and commit 36142e6d, which was not intended.

The Web API is able to output JSON and Python formated data, which can be
toggled using the variable <tt>output_format=json</tt> or
<tt>output_format=python</tt>. The default has now been changed back to
be JSON.

In case you created scripts against this API since 1.2.8b8, did not use
a JSON parser to load the data and used something like <tt>eval()</tt>
in Python instead, you will have to change your scripts. You can either
add the variable <tt>output_format=python</tt> or replace your <tt>eval()</tt>
with <tt>json.loads()</tt> in Python.
