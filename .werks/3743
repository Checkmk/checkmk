Title: mk_jolokia: Fix possible code injection
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.8p10
Date: 1472111893
Class: security

The plugin now requires either the json or simplejson python library to work.

Python 2.6 or higher ships with json, in this case, the plugin will work just
as before.

simplejson is available for Python 2.5 and higher, installation of this package
is required for the plugin to work.

Older python versions are not supported, please query your Jolokia instances
from another host in these cases (recommended) or continue to use the old version
of the plugin. (not recommended)

In absence of the json or simplejson python libraries, the mk_jolokia plugin
would previously try to parse the Jolokia response with python eval(), allowing
a MITM attacker to inject arbitrary code.
