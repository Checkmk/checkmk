Title: Fixed loosing site configuration when editing hosts in WATO slave sites

Class: fix

When having a distributed setup where WATO is enabled on slaves and hosts were
editied, the hosts in the folder of that host were resetting the site attribute
so that they are being monitored by the remote site, even when they were configured
to be monitored on another site.

The slave sites are now checking for the configured unknown sites and warning you
about that fact. To override the configured site attributes, you have to explicitly
change the value of the site attribute.
