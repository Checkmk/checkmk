Title: Active HTTP check now supports multiline regexp matching
Level: 1
Component: wato

Class: feature

Previous versions of the configuration form did not provide the
option to form regex patterns accross multi lines. The used
check_http plugin provides the option "-l" to realize this. The
WATO form now has a checkbox to make it possible to use this.
