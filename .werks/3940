In case of the agent section showing extra information before the "Status(...)" line like the following, the check crashed. This has been fixed now.

Example agent section showing extra information in the first line:

```
<<<aix_hacmp_services>>>
clshowsrv is a tracked alias for /usr/es/sbin/cluster/utilities/clshowsrv
Status of the RSCT subsystems used by PowerHA SystemMirror:
(...)
```
