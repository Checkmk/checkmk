Title: check_ftp: cleanup configuration via WATO, remove Hostname field
Level: 2
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.4b1
Date: 1387374334
Class: fix

The <tt>check_ftp</tt> active check does not longer need nor allow to
specify a host name. The host name is always present: the host the check is
mapped onto. Also the specification of an alternative host name would not
be consistent with any of the other networking checks.

If you need an FTP check on a specific host then please add that host to
the monitoring. Exceptions can alsway be done via <tt>custom_checks</tt>.
