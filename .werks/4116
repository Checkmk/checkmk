Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i3

Class: feature

The plugin for windows could be used with the Oracle wallet. The support is
limitted to all Instances except ASM. This function is only for
administrators who really knows how to use the wallet.

You have to add an entry with the name of the instance. Please check the
connection with SQLPlus before trying to use the plugin.
The plugin use the following connection:
`sqlplus /@<ORACLE_SID>`

You have to add a credential to the wallet with the ORACLE_SID as name for
the entry:
Example:
```
mkstore -wrl <Wallet Directory> createCredential <ORACLE_SID> <Username> <Password>
```

The wallet is only used, when username is set to '/'. Password,
hostname and listener-port is ignored, because the tnsnames.ora is used.

Please read the doumentation from Oracle for using the wallet. The
sqlnet.ora must be configured for your environment and the wallet must be
created before adding some entries. You could use TNS_ADMIN in
mk_oracle_cfg.ps1 for pointing to the sqlnet configuration for the plugin.
