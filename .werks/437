Title: Convert WATO rule for debug_log into simple Checkbox
Level: 1
Component: wato

Class: feature

Do you know the plugin output <i>invalid output from agent, invalid check parameters or ...</i>?
The option for debugging such failed checks has been converted from an absolute
path to a simple Checkbox. The target path for the log file is now hardcoded
and will be printed by the failed check in the plugin output.

Existing configuration will not be touched, though, and honor the configured
path - as long as you do not change the option via WATO. <tt>main.mk</tt> still
allows the old way:

F+:main.mk

# Hard code path to log file
debug_log = "/var/log/foo.log"

# Simply enable and use standard path
debug_log = True

# Disable
debug_log = None

# New way to disable
debug_log = False
