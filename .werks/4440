Title: check_sftp: New Check for SFTP Connections
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: feature
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
State: unknown
Version: 1.4.0b9
Date: 1488271633

With this new active check you are able to verify successful logins and
optionally a timestamp of a file or operability of getting/putting a file.

This plugin needs the python libary paramiko and is therefore not out of
the box compatible with older releases of Check_MK.
