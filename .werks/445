Title: mem.win: Allow time-averaging of values before applying levels
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1389692900
Class: feature

You now can set an averaging time horizon in minutes. If you do that
the levels for memory and page file usage will be applied to their
average over time. That make the check less reactive to small peaks
in the memory usage.
