You can now specifiy which quicksearch filters should be automatically traversed
whenever a text is entered in the quicksearch field. The default behaviour is
<ul>
<li>h: Hostname</li>
<li>al: Hostalias</li>
<li>ad: Hostaddress</li>
<li>s: Service description</li>
</ul>

Results for each filter are now shown in separate topics, when there are matches
for multiple filters. You can also enable filters which are currently not used
in the default search
<ul>
<li>tg: Hosttag</li>
<li>hg: Hostgroup</li>
<li>sg: Servicegroup</li>
</ul>

Additionally, you can modify the matching behaviour for a specific filter.
When a match is found you can continue the search, abort the search and show all results
or abort the search and show only the results for the current filter.


Search (magnifying glass) behaviour: If there are multiple topics shown in the
dropdown result, the topmost topic is shown in the resulting page, since not
all topics can be combined effectiviely.
Keep in mind that you can configure the topic ordering in the global settings.
