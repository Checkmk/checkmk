Class: fix

The compiliation process now spawns less worker processes for the compilation, which reduces the overall CPU load.

Furthermore a race condition has been fixed, which was likely to happen when all of these conditions were true:<br>
<ul>
<li>there were several dozens BI requests per minute, e.g. from multiple web browsers</li>
<li>a distributed montitoring setup started to deploy new configurations</li>
<li>there were lots (>100) of BI aggregations configured</li>
<ul>
