Title: Fixed possible reflected XSS in webapi.py
Level: 2
Component: multisite

In the Check_MK 1.4 branch URLs like this could be used for a
reflected XSS attack:

<tt>http://<test host>/<site>/check_mk/webapi.py?_username=<script>alert("XSS")</script>&_secret=AnythingHere

The error message was interpreted as HTML while it should be a
plain text error message. This has been fixed now.
