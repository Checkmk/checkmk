There were a few configurations where the IP used for Graphite servers was
always 127.0.0.1: Simulation mode, using store SNMP walks, and few more
highly obscure configurations used only for development.  This was wrong,
the Graphite servers have nothing to do with the monitoring in itself.

This has been fixed, the lookup for Graphite servers is now always being
done via DNS.
