Title: f5_bigip_cluster_status_v11_2: Now has its own check plugin file; This updates werk #4819
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: fix

We had to differentiate between F5 version lower and greater than 11.2
because the datasource/OID had changed. The related check plugins were
{{f5_bigip_cluster_status}},
{{f5_bigip_cluster_status.v11_2}}.

Werk #4819 revealed another bug regarding these check plugins:
if F5 version was greater than 11.2 the SNMP scan function
in the main-check {{f5_bigip_cluster_status}} returned False and the
sub-check {{f5_bigip_cluster_status.v11_2}} had no chance to generate
any service. Thus no service {{BIG-IP Cluster Status}} was discovered
for F5 devices with version greater than 11.2.
