Title: New concept of favorite hosts and services plus matching filters and views
Level: 2
Component: multisite
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1383411707
Class: feature

The new "Favorites" feature introduces a new pair of commands for hosts
and services: <i>Add to favourites</i> and <i>Remove from favourites</i>.
It allows you to manage your personal list of favourite hosts and
services. This list is saved on a per-user-base. Objects on this list are
marked with a star icon.

The favourites-list can be used for filtering. Two new predefined views
"Favourite hosts" and "Favourite services" are available for showing you
favourite objects. Also the new filters have been added to several views.
Please note, that when you make a host a favourite, the services of that host
will not automatically get favourites as well. But you easily can use the
"Service Search" view for listing all services on favorite hosts, if you
like that behaviour.

With a combination of the existing filters you can do many useful queries
like "Show me all problems on my favourite hosts in host group X".

The advantage of favourites as opposed to host- and service groups are:
<ul>
<li>No change to the monitoring configuration is neccessary and thus no restart of the core.</li>
<li>Each user can manage his indiviual list.</li>
</ul>
