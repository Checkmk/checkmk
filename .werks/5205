When using the host rename feature of WATO and setting a new name that
contains a dot, for example myhost.domain, the rename failed to set
a correct new name. Instead of setting the intended name, the name was
set to "myhost[.]domain" in different places.

The affected files are:

<ul>
<li>Nagios core: <tt>var/nagios/retention.dat</tt></li>
<li>NagVis maps: <tt>etc/nagvis/maps/*.cfg</tt></li>
<li>Monitoring history of all supported cores:<ul>
  <li><tt>var/check_mk/core/history</tt></li>
  <li><tt>var/check_mk/core/archive/*</tt></li>
  <li><tt>var/nagios/nagios.log</tt></li>
  <li><tt>var/nagios/archive/*</tt></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

In case you did such a rename action, you can stop your site and
fix the wrong names in the mentioned files on your own, e.g. by using
<tt>sed</tt>.
