Level: 2
Component: agents
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.4.0p19

Class: fix

Werk #5261 introduced a bug that made it impossible to bake new agents for some specific rulesets.
This would result in error messages like the following:

<pre>
"TypeError: key ('custom', 'win_certificates/lib/local/win_certificates.ps1') is not a string"
</pre>

After an update, no further action is required.
