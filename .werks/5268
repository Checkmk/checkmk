Due to an inconsistent exception handling in cmk-update-agent program flow, the running program could exit before releasing its lock file.

This could result in an error message

C+:
ERROR An instance of cmk_update_agent.py is already running on this system. Aborting...
C-:

when running cmk-update-agent again.

If you are affected by this error, please delete the lock file "cmk-update-agent.pid", located at your system's or user's temp-dir, once manually.
