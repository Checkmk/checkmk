Title: cmk-update-agent: Add support for proxy servers
Level: 2
Component: agents
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1526285787
Class: feature

The agent updater is now able to connect to the Check_MK server via proxy.

With this werk, a new checkbox "Use proxy server" is added to the Agent Updater rule configuration. You can now either configure a HTTP, SOCKS4 or SOCKS5 proxy (with optional credentials) or choose to follow the environment variables "HTTP_PROXY" and "HTTPS_PROXY" that may be set locally on the hosts.

Please note that the configuration default is still set to ignore local proxy settings.
