When executing "omd update" as site user to update a site from 1.4.0p17
or older an error could occur blocking the update. The message looks like
this:

<pre>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/omd/versions/1.4.0p17.cee/bin/omd", line 52, in <module>
    import tarfile, fnmatch
  File "/omd/versions/1.4.0p17.cee/lib/python2.7/tarfile.py", line 52, in <module>
    import copy
  File "/omd/versions/1.4.0p17.cee/lib/python2.7/copy.py", line 52, in <module>
    import weakref
  File "/omd/versions/1.4.0p17.cee/lib/python2.7/weakref.py", line 14, in <module>
    from _weakref import (
ImportError: cannot import name _remove_dead_weakref
</pre>

This issue was caused by a mixup of python versions during the update which has
been fixed now by using the correct libraries during the update.

To workaround this issue, you could run the "omd update" command as root user instead
of the site user.
