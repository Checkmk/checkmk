Title: cmk-update-agent: Make executable-Format-rule relevant for Linux only
Level: 1
Component: agents
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
State: unknown
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1538135641

After introducing the binary Format for the agent updater, we added a rule to the
agent updater ruleset that enables the user to choose the format of
the cmk-update-agent executable.

Hence the packaged binary format is only runnable on Linux, this rule now gets ignored
for all other OSes.

Please note: If you want to enable automatic updates on Linux hosts that run on an
architecture other than x86-64 or x86, you have to explicitibly choose to deploy the
python script format, since the binary formats are not runnable on these architectures.
