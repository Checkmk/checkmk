The service list status views of Check_MK can now be sorted by the column "Perf-O-Meter".

The sorting of the perfometers is sorted by these values:

<ol>
<li>First sort by the optional perfometer group or perfometer ID</li>
<li>Second sort by the sort value of each perfometer</li>
</ol>

<strong>The Perfometer group / perfometer ID</strong>

Each perfometer declaration can have an optional element <tt>sort_group</tt>. This element
holds a string that can be used to group different perfometers (that visualize comparable values)
together.

In case no <tt>sort_group</tt> is defined, the internal ID of the perfometer definition is used.
This means that all perfometers which are rendered by the same logical function are sorted together
in a perfometer group.

<strong>The sort value</strong>

The sort value of a perfometer is calculated in different ways for each perfometer type based on
the current metrics of this service.

<ul>
<li><i>Logarithmic</i>: The single logarithmic value displayed by this perfometer is used</li>
<li><i>Linear</i>: The first segment of the displayed values is used</li>
<li><i>Stacked</i>: The sort value of the first stacked perfometer is used</li>
<li><i>Dual</i>: The maximum of both displayed value is used for sorting</li>
</ul>

The sorting only works for perfometers that are implemented as metric plugin
(in <tt>plugins/metrics/</tt>). The legacy perfometers that are implemented as perfometer
plugins can not be sorted.

Dear check developers: All perfometers that visualize equal types of values have to be
sorted together in a sort group. For example all checks that monitor fileystems should have
equal perfometers that can be compared to each other and should therefor be sortable by their
disk usage.
