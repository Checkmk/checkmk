Title: recurring updates of serial numbers of disabled ldap users fixed
Level: 2
Component: multisite
Version: 1.2.4b5
Date: 1390303011
Class: fix

If a user is disabled in LDAP, it gets locked in multisite and its serial number
is increased, so that the user gets kicked out. Before this change the serial
number was increased in every following sync. Now the serial number is only
increased the first time a disabled user is synced.
