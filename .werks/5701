Title: Windows agent: renew logging
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1517473402
Class: feature

The logging functionality of the Windows agent was rewritten. The key
features and changes are as follows:

 * The logs are built incrementally over time and rotated up to 5
   copies once the log size of 8 MB is reached.
 * The formatting of the log entries has been changed to include a
   numeric log level (0...7) and an absolute timestamp with the
   accuracy of milliseconds (instead of a relative time since the
   agent started).
 * The naming of agent logfiles has been changed: the agent logs to
   CHECK_MK_AGENT_INSTALL_DIR\log\agent.log which will then be rotated
   as agent.log.N, N={1...5}
 * Crash info as subsection [[[Check_MK Agent]]] within the section
   `<<<logwatch>>>` was removed. Now that the logs are persistent,
   information about past crashes can be obtained in the logs.
 * Debug log entries are enabled by setting crash_debug = yes in the
   global section of check_mk.ini.
 * The names of the various logfiles no longer appear in the output of
   section Check_MK when crash_debug = yes.
