Title: check_mk_agent.linux, check_mk_agent.openwrt: specify message digest for encrypted agent output explicitly

Class: fix

For encrypted agent output the default message digest algorithm of OpenSSL was
used before. Prior to OpenSSL 1.1 the default is MD5 which is what the Check_MK
server is expecting as well. Starting from OpenSSL 1.1. the default message
digest algorithm changed to SHA-256 which leads to problems in the
communication between hosts with a new OpenSSL version and the Check_MK server.
Now the message digest algorithm is specified explicitly as MD5 to circumvent
any ambiguity.
