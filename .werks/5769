Title: site_object_counts: New check which collects information about the amount of different host types or used check commands of OMD sites
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0b1
Date: 1520331000
Class: feature

To make this check work please install the {{mk_site_object_counts}}
agent plugin and specify host tags or check commands within the
{{site_object_counts.cfg}} configration file. The following options
are available:
<table>
<tr><td>{TAGS}</td><td>global host tags</td></tr>
<tr><td>{SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS}</td><td>global check commands</td></tr>
<tr><td>{SITES}</td><td>restriction to specified sites</td></tr>
<tr><td>{TAGS_$SITENAME}</td><td>site specific host tags</td></tr>
<tr><td>{SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS_$SITENAME}</td><td>site specific check commands</td></tr>
</table>

The agent plugin is executed if and only if OMD is installed and there's
a configuration file. Sites which provide an opened Livestatus socket
{/omd/sites/$SITENAME/tmp/run/live} are taken into account.

Without the restrictive option {SITES} all sites on that server are
considered which satisfy above conditions.

If more than one value is assigned they have to be separated by one space, eg.
<ul>
<li>{TAGS=prod snmp}</li>
<li>{SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS_sitename=kernel lnx_if}</li>
</ul>
