If a user gets a restriction to authorized sites, it will also restrict the notifications to these sites.
Previously, if no <i>Match site</i> filter was set as specific condition, the user rule matched on all sites.


With this change a user notification rule is only checked on the users authorized sites.


Furthermore, a user can no longer select foreign (non-authorized) sites in the <i>Match site</i> dropdown field.
