Title: Fixed Check_MK check helper crashes related to loading of precompiled checks
Level: 2
Component: checks

Class: fix

The latest versions no longer read checks as plain text python files (Werk 6046).
The operation which generates the precompilated file was not atomic, so a file could
be partially written, while being read by another process.
This caused various exceptions in multiple checks.
