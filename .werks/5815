Title: Background Job/User synchronization: Fixed text encoding bug / Fixed incorrect exception message

The user synchronsation background incorrectly reported an exception instead of a progress update.
However, this didn't affect the outcome of the operation, so no actual harm was done.


Furthermore, umlauts in info messages no longer cause exceptions.
