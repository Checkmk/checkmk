Title: New Feature: SLA reporting
Level: 3
Component: multisite
Class: feature
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
State: unknown
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1528996067

SLA reports are a continuation of the already existing availability reports.
The data from the availability feature can be additionally modified, before it is evaluated by the SLA requirements.

Currently these two SLA requirements are implemented
<ul>
<li>State Percentage: The service state OK/WARN/CRIT/UNKNOWN is lower/higher than x percent</li>
<li>Outage count: Maximum number of outages with a length of x minutes</li>
</ul>

Note: An upcoming SLA requirement will be "Minimum time between outages"



Before the availability data gets forwarded to the computation plugins (which check the actual requirements) it is
<ul>
<li>further shortened by applying timeperiods, for example "Only check weekdays"</li>
<li>cut into mulitple timeframes (daily/weekly/monthly), specified by period in the SLA definition</li>
</ul>

Each timeframe is computed separately, so you will get several SLA results, if the timerange you are interested in spans multiple SLA periods.




Configuration

First of all you need to configure a SLA definition. Just like views and reports, SLA definitions are configured per user,
so you can setup a SLA and publish it to other users.

SLA definitions are not inherently bound to services.
A SLA definition can be assigned to a service, via the WATO rule <tt>Assign SLA to service</tt>.
For views, the multisite GUI currently offers two different painters to display SLA information
<ul>
<li>SLA - Service specific: This painter renders SLA definitions, which were assigned by WATO rule. Therefore, one table
column in a view can display multiple SLA definition types. The timerange, however, is fixed for all SLAs and can be configured in the painter</li>
<li>SLA - Column specific: This painter renders the same SLA definition for all services in the table</li>
</ul>

There are several configuration options for both painters.
<ul>
<li>SLA timerange: The timerange specifies the start and end date you are interested in. A SLA definition only has a
recurring period (e.g. weekly). So if you have a SLA definition with a monthly period and set the timerange from
01.01.2018 to 31.03.2018, you will get three separate SLA results, one for each month</li>
<li>Layout options: With these options you can configure the content of the painter. You may also choose only to display
the SLA name, which means no actual SLA computation, hereby saving performance</li>
<li>Plugin display options</li>Allows you to configure the precision of percentage (float) values and additional layout options</li>
</ul>

There is also a SLA details page available. This page offers detailed information regarding the computation.
<ul>
<li>Availability rawdata used in computation</li>
<li>Aggregated results (the actual SLA outcome) over all computation plugins</li>
<li>Subresults for each used computation plugin</li>
<li>SLA specification: Includes all settings which were used to create this report</li>
</ul>


Please note that this feature is quite new and still under heavy development.
The goal in version 1.5 is to get some hands on experience and add some minor improvements and bugfixes over time.
Exporting the SLA data into PDF reports is currently only supported within views.
Later on, the SLA details page will also receive a "Export to PDF" button.
