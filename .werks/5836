Title: Event Console messages without a service level can be matched against service level 0 now.

Various message sources, e.g. syslog messages or SNMP traps, do not carry a
service level with them.  If an event console rule specified a matching
criterion including the service level value 0 (meaning "no service level
specified"), the rule didn't fire for such messages.  This behavior was
confusing and inconsistent with the rule matching for notifications.

Messages not carrying a service level have an implicit service level 0 now,
so EC rules can match for this case.
