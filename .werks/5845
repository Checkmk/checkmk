Class: fix

* fsc_fans and fsc_temp do not discover services anymore, if corresponding fsc_sc2_* data is available.
* snmp_scan_functions were made more readable using functions in fsc.include

Incompatible, because you may have to rediscover hosts formerly discovering both, either fsc_fans or fsc_temp AND their corresponding fsc_sc2_* checks.
