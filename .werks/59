Title: agent_vpshere: new option for supporting ESX 4.1
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.4b1
Date: 1387191682
Class: fix

The current fast implementation of the ESX vSphere agent for Check_MK does not
yet support ESX versions older than 5.0.  The most promiment such version is
ESX 4.1. There is now a new option <i>Support ESX 4.1 (using slower PySphere
implementation)</i> in the WATO rule for the ESX agent that forces using the
old pysphere-based agent.
