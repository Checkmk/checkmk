Title: Windows agent: Many WMI queries could lead to integer overflow
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: fix

Integer values returned by a number of WMI queries were handled incorrectly,
squeezing 64 bit integers into 32 bit representation. This lead to sporadical
erroneous results for a number of agent sections / checks. Potentially
affected were at least the checks wmi_cpuload and ps, but basically any checks
using information provided by WMI. The symptoms of this may have been varying
across different checks.
