The output of section MRPE was incorrectly formatted. A null character
at the end of the output string caused the output to be cut abruptly
and missing a newline character before the following section header.
Broken by commit d0ae246003d630f80ad5ff3fbe469552738141a9 that was
included in releases 1.5.0i3 and 1.5.0b1.
