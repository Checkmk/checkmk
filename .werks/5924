Title: Windows: Use WMI for process monitoring by default
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: feature

The option use_wmi has been available as an 'experimental' feature
for the section ps of the Windows agent since release 1.2.7i3. The
default setting has still been to use the 'native' WinAPI for obtaining
process information. As the native way seems to fail to obtain
information about all desired processes at times and the WMI option
seems to be working without significant problems, the default value of
the option is now changed to 'yes'.
