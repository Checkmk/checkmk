The plugin windows_updates.vbs has the tendency of running quite long.
The default execution timeout of 60s for Windows plugins is in most
cases not enough, resulting in the plugin being started every time
the Windows agent is contacted and always timing out after 60s without
delivering results. At its worst the plugin may cause high CPU load
repeated every minute.

Most users of windows_updates.vbs have been forced to configure a
timeout rule for the plugin in Agent Bakery. To simplify this process,
Agent Bakery now delivers windows_updates.vbs with a preconfigured
timeout of 10 minutes that should be enough for most users. The
already existing defaults for async execution and cache_age of 4 hours
were preserved.
