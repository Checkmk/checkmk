Title: Fixed broken HTTP header auth for not yet existing users

This was broken since ~1.5.0i3. When a user which has not been created
in Check_MK before is being authenticated using the optional HTTP header
authentication and logged in using the "default user profile", some
host- and service views were not working as expected. They were showing
some exception like `KeyError: u'<USER>'`.

A workaround in the affected versions is to create the user accounts
before the user try to access the GUI.
