The LDAP sync can lock users in Check_MK based on their locking property in the Active Directory.
When a user was locked in AD and Check_MK performed the next sync, the user login was disabled.
The inverse operation was not working.

Unlocking previously locked users has now been implemented correctly. Another change is, that
the locking property in Check_MK is now read-only for LDAP users.
