Title: Unified mk_oracle and mk_oracle.aix
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1523524818
Class: feature

The agent plugin {{mk_oracle.aix}} does not exist anymore.
Instead the {{mk_oracle}} plugin was refactored and now
supports AIX, too.

In order to use the new plugin please install it to the
well-known agent plugin path or use the agent bakery if
you have a enterprise edition.

The new option '--log' logs some steps to the related log file
which can be found in {{$MK_VARDIR/log/mk_oracle.log}} and
helps to find any errors. Please note that the shell command
'flock' has to be installed.
