Event console rules specify a service level, but it was a bit unclear what
that actually means.  Previously it was just a default value to use when the
incoming message did not carry a service level itself.  If it carried one
(including '0'), this part of the rule did not have any effect.

This behavior was a bit confusing and did not cover all use cases, so you
can now specify what should happen when the incoming message already has a
service level: Keep it (old behavior, the default) or overwrite it
unconditionally with the configured service level.
