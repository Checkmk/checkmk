Title: Fixed handling of expected regular messages
Level: 2
Component: ec

Class: fix

If expected regular messages did not arrive at the event console and the
resulting new event was not merged with a previous one, the EC could go into
an endless loop, logging Python exceptions all the time.  This has been
fixed.
