Title: Fixed creation of rule-based downtimes

Class: fix

Due to a bug introduced in 1.5.0i3, it was impossible to create new working
rule-based downtimes: Although the corresponding rules seemed to work fine, no
actual downtimes were created from them, as could be seen from the "Downtimes"
view. Furthermore, already existing rule-based downtimes were duplicated on
every core restart/reload.

Both bugs have been fixed, and the CMC takes care of removing any duplicate
downtimes at restart/reload.
