Title: chrony: Fixed incompatibility with RedHat 7.5
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
State: unknown
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1524491173

The SELinux rules shipped with RedHat 7.5 deny execution of chronyc like
our agent did before. We have changed the agent code to be able to also
work with RedHat 7.5 out of the box.
