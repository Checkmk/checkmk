When activating the changed configuration, the first step "Initializing activation" may
take a lot of time when there are a lot of files located below the "local" hierarchy of
the site.

This is caused by a backup mechanism that is executed in this step. It saves snapshots
of your WATO configuration (not the whole site nor the whole config of the site) to
archives which are located below "var/check_mk/wato/snapshots". These can be used for
reverting the changes in the GUI and for recovery of configuration files. This is not
primarily a backup mechanism, better use the Check_MK site backup for this task.

These archives were also containing the whole local/ hierarchy. In case there are a lot
of small files or some larger files in this hierarchy, this slowed down the activation
significantly. We've decided to remove those files from the config snapshot now.
