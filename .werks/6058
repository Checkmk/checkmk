Using the global setting "Escape HTML codes in plugin output" you can configure
whether or not HTML contained in the status output of hosts / services is
interpreted by the GUI globally.

In case you need the HTML of a specific check interpreted by the GUI, it is
better to use the new rulesets "Escape HTML codes in host output" or "Escape
HTML codes in service output". Using these rulesets you can selectively disable
the escaping for specific hosts / services.
