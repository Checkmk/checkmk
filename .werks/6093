Title: Bash completion: Make completion work on SLES
Level: 1
Component: omd
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
State: unknown
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1526457105

The completion file of the RPMs is now installed as /etc/bash_completion.d/omd.sh instead
of /etc/bash_completion.d/omd because SLES only interprets files ending with .sh.
