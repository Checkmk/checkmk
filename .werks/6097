The Check_MK service of multiple hosts may terminate without proper error
message resulting just in status output "(null)" in specific situations.

This happened when the precompiled host check files
(var/check_mk/precompiled/[host]) were executed by Nagios using the system wide
Python interpreter instead of the site specific interpreter.
