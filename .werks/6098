In case a host named "cmk" is being monitored, the "Check_MK" services of all hosts
terminate with an output of "(null)". When executing a precompiled host check file (var/check_mk/precompiled/[host]) manually
it terminates with an error message like this:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/omd/sites/beta/var/check_mk/precompiled/beta", line 7, in <module>
    
ImportError: No module named cmk.log
