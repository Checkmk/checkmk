Title: Fixed partial uninstall of Check_MK 1.5 versions (leaving sitecustomize.pyc)
Level: 1
Component: packages
Class: fix
Compatible: compat

Version: 1.6.0b1

The python delivered with Check_MK was not precompiling the lib/python2.7/sitecustomize.pyc
during packaging. It was then created during runtime on the target system. Since this file
is not under control of the RPM/DEB packages the file was left on the filesystem after
uninstall. The version was still visible after removal in "omd version" output until one
removed the /omd/versions/[version] directory.
