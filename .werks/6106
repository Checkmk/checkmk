When check specific configuration variables are set in the Check_MK configuration,
they could make the Check_MK checks of hosts that are not using these checks fail.

This resulted in Check_MK services showing an empty output. When executing the
precompiled host checks on the command line in debug mode, errors are shown. Like
this:

python /omd/sites/beta/var/check_mk/precompiled/[hostname] -v
Cannot read in configuration file /omd/sites/[site]/etc/check_mk/conf.d/wato/rules.mk: name 'fileinfo_groups' is not defined
