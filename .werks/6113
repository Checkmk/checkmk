Title: winperf_processor, esx_vsphere_hostsystem.cpu_usage: shift duplicate service detection from the special agent to the check
Level: 1

Class: fix

Previously, duplicate services for winperf_processor and
esx_vsphere_hostsystem.cpu_usage were recognized in the special agent. If
duplicate services would appear the corresponding entries in the special agent
were removed.

With the new option to configure multiple datasources for one host this logic
will not work since there is no possibility for the special agent to inspect
the section winperf_processor of the Check_MK agent. Therefore, the check
esx_vsphere_hostsystem.cpu_usage now recognizes duplicate services using
extra sections.

The transition from the old to the new logic should happen transparently, i.e.
no actions are required by the user.
