Previously, the agent bakery rulesets "Perform Real-Time Checks", "Agent
updater (Linux, Windows)", "ORACLE Databases (Linux, Solaris, AIX)", and
"Plugins, local checks and MRPE for non-root users" did not have the correct
matching behaviour. Now, the correct behaviour which is shown in the decription
for "Matching" in the GUI is used.

If you have multiple rules for any of those rulesets please make sure to bake
the agents again, and deploy the newly baked agents to the affected hosts.

This Werk also fixes a crash of "Bake agents" for rules with the matching
behaviour "Each parameter is defined by the first matching rule where that
parameter is set (checked)".
