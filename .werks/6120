Class: fix

Since Werk 5748 cisco_nexus_cpu is preferred over cisco_cpu on all Nexus
devices. As a result short peaks in CPU utilization might result in a WARN or
CRIT on devices that used cisco_cpu before, since the cisco_nexus_cpu check
does not deliver averaged values. To add the possibility of averaging to the
cisco_nexus_cpu check the ruleset "CPU utilization for simple devices" is now
used. With this ruleset it is possible to define arbitrary averaging periods.
The old ruleset "CPU utilization for Appliances" is not supported anymore for
the cisco_nexus_cpu check.

To accommodate for this change affected hosts have to be rediscovered and all
rules for devices that use the cisco_nexus_cpu checks have to be moved to the
new ruleset.
