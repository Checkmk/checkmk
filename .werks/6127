Astaro and Synology are Linux but should use hr_mem. Otherwise caches/buffers
are included in used memory generating critical a state.

To switch to hr_mem on these devices the services on the affected hosts have to
be rediscovered. After the rediscovery the ucd_mem service will become
undecided and the hr_mem services will be monitored. The undecided services
will only be shown for a short time and will automatically disappear when the
caches in Check_MK are updated. I.e. after the rediscovery now further actions
are necessary.
