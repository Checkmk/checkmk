Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: feature

Previously the {{mssql.vbs}} agent plugin did not send information
about the instance identifier. Thus all blocked session information
was processed by one service and the mapping of this information to
the right instance was missing.

In order to make the new check plugin work take the following steps:
<ul>
<li>Install the newest agent plugin {{mssql.vbs}}.</li>
<li>Remove the old deprecared ruleset {{MSSQL Blocked Sessions}}.</li>
<li>Enable new service description {{MSSQL Blocked Sessions}} in global settings, execution of checks</li>
<li>Perform a rediscovery on the affected hosts.</li>
<li>Apply the new ruleset {{MSSQL Blocked Sessions}}.</li>
<li>Activate changes.</li>
</ul>
