The calculation of the CPU utilization of processes on linux systems was not taking the number
of CPU cores into account for a long time. This results in CPU utilizations reported with more
than 100%, up to 100%*CPU-cores. For example in case 3 processes use 3 of 6 cores at 100%, this
resulted in a usage of 300%.

The intention of the change in 1.4.0p27 was to make the windows and linux ps checks both take
the number of CPU cores into account and cap the usage at 100%. The problem with this change is
that all possibly existing thresholds that have been configured for the old scheme will not
work anymore with the new scheme.

We have now reverted the changes version 1.4.0p27 introduced to get the old behavior back.

In a future release, we will finally make the switch to the new scheme. But this will be done
in a compatible way where the already configured thresholds will still work.
