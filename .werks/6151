Class: fix

When using SNMPv3 communication issues with some devices may occur. From the user point of
view timeouts are reported by Check_MK originating from Net-SNMP not receiving a valid response.

This kind of issue is related to a broken negotiation (related to the maximum message size) between
the monitoring and the monitored device.
