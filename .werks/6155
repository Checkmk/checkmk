It could happen that some active checks were not correctly shown in the tables
"active checks" or "disabled active checks". This was caused by specific
disabled services rules. For example when using this two rules:

1. Enable all services starting with "HTTP"
2. Disable all services

In this situation the HTTP service was not displayed on the discovery page.
