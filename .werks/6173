Title: Fixed possible crash in Check_MK and Check_MK HW/SW Inventory
Level: 1

When using pretty outdated "Do hardware/software Inventory" rules which
have been saved before 1.4, this could lead to crashing Check_MK and
Check_MK HW/SW inventory services with errors like this:

'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'

Workaround: Open this ruleset and save the rules in the relevant folders.
The configs will then be transformed and rewritten in the current format
which prevents this crash.
