Title: Dropped fping dependency (Removes check_fping)
Level: 1
Component: packages

Class: fix

The external fping package dependency has been removed from Check_MK. It is
a utility to send "fast pings". The active check "check_fping" needs this
package to work.

In Check_MK it is standard and recommended to use "check_icmp" for pinging
hosts using ICMP. It is used for the host checks of the Raw Edition and for
the active checks named "PING". The Microcore uses it's smart ping feature
for the host checks by default and falls back to "check_icmp" in some
situations.

The check check_fping is not used by default. In case you used it, it is
recommended to use one of the options mentioned above. If this is no option
for you for some reason, please let us know.
