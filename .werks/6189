OpenHardwareMonitorCLI, the executable wrapper for triggering
OpenHardwareMonitor by Check_MK Windows Agent, did not run on
some Win7 machines. Moreover, it was not possible to compile
OpenHardwareMonitorCLI with versions 4.x of Mono (tried with
Mono 4.6.2.0 / XBuild 14.0). Providing the build option
/p:TargetFrameworkVersion="v4.5" both fixed the build with Mono
4.x and made resulting executable compatible with all tested
Windows versions (tested on Win7 and Server 2016).
