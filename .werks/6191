Werk #3106 (Check_MK 1.4.0i1) introduced the possibility of configuring
additional eventlogs with the keyword 'logname'. However, this was not
supported by the Agent Bakery that only knew the keyword 'logfile'.

Now, additional, non-standard eventlogs that are not found in Windows
registry, can be configured for monitoring with the ordinary keyword
'logfile', e.g.
"logfile Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy/Operational = warn"
so that they can also be configured normally through the Agent Bakery.
Note that non-standard eventlogs also require the option vista_api to
be set to 'yes.'

Using the keyword 'logname' is strongly discouraged and that keyword
should be considered deprecated. It will remain functional only for
compatibility with old, manually configured check_mk.ini files.
