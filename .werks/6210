6210 Separate Checkgroups for 3par_capacity, 3par_volume und 3par_cpgs

3par_capacity, 3par_cpgs and 3par_volumes: Different rules for these three
checks can now be created.

The older more general rules will no longer match the services of
3par_capacity and 3par_cpgs. For these services new Rules under the names
"3Par Capacity (used space and growth)" and "3Par CPG (used space and growth)"
have to be created.
