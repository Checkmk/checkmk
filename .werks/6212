Title: MKPs: Set correct executable permission for active checks
Level: 1
Component: packages
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1534756411
Class: fix

Previously packaged Nagios plugins / active checks have not been made executable after being
 installed, which effectively prevented the automatic installation of active checks via the
 packaging mechanism.
This has been fixed.
