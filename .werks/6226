This allows to apply rules only on specific sites. Restricting
rules to sites can yield performance benefits in environments with
many sites. Beyond that, this is required to make the feature expect
regular messages work in a distributed environment with
config replication.

Example: If you have three centrally configured event consoles,
and you want a device to regularily report to one of them, you
previously had no way to configure that only the one site reports
missing messages. Instead, all sites the device doesn't send messages
to would repeatedly open events. This limitation can now be
worked around by specifying to which site expect rules should apply.
