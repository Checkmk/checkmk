Title: WATO GUI rule matching: Fixed broken evaluation of negated WATO rules

The rule matching algorithm failed, if there was a negated service or item specified.
Instead of a negative match, a positive match was returned. This has been fixed.
Note: This was a GUI only bug, it didn't have any effect on the actual monitoring.
