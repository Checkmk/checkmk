Title: Removed dangerous "omd uninstall" mode
Level: 1
Component: omd
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1530520594
Class: fix

This mode was only used during early development. When being executed
on a system where Check_MK is installed through OS packages, it left
the package manager in a bad state where the OMD files are gone but
package meta information are still left.
