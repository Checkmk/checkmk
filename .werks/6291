Input errors on the werk list page were not validated correctly. This could
lead to empty werk lists when using invalid values in the "Searching &
Filtering" form without displaying a helpful message.

The error handling of input issues has been improved by displaying error messages
above the form and highlighting the fields in question when an error occured.
