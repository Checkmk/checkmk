Title: sap_hana_filesystem, sap_hana_mem: Fixed wrong conversion of filesystem and memory values

In order to get correct calculated values in the service details
and graphs you have to install the latest {{mk_sap_hana}} agent plugin.
The plugin now sends values in bytes and the check plugin can handle them
correctly.

Before the plugin reports these values as GB which were rounded to two
decimal places. In turn the check plugin converts these values to
bytes, applies parameters and finally converts them to a user friendly
format. This whole process may produce unprecise results.
