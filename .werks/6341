When installing agent bakery RPMs/DEBs an error message "SyntaxError: invalid syntax" could occur.
This was caused by a pre-install script that should warn about incompatible Python versions. This
script was incompatible to older Python versions, like Python 2.4.

At least in case of the RPMs the installation did complete despite of this message.
