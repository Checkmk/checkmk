Since werk #4167 it was possible to prevent users from configuring specific
notification plugins by setting the notification plugin permissions to "no". As
a result all notification rules that use the not permitted notification plugin
were not visible anymore to this user.

This hiding of rules could be confusing and lead to bugs. We decided to show all
rules now but prevent modifications of these rules when the user is not permitted
to perform the modifications.

When cloning notification rules or creating notification rules with identical
parameters only one of the rules was shown. The others could be hidden, but
still be in existing.

In other situations, when a user with limited permissions on notification plugins
edits the notification rules, it could happen that all notification rules that
use other plugins were deleted by accident.

These problems were introduced with werk #4167.
