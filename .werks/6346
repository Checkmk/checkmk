During host rename an error "TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting" could
occur. This happened when the host was configured in at least one folder as parent.

In such a situation the host was renamed partially. The best way to recover from this situation
is to activate all pending changes and use the renaming feature again to change the host back
to it's original name. Then update to at least 1.5.0b9 and try renaming the host again.
