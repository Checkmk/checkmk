When a new monitoring site is create using WATO it was intended to
set the option "Sync with LDAP connections" to make the site not
perform an LDAP sync on it's own.

We assume that new sites will be added as WATO slave site in most
cases. In this scenario you normally don't want to let the slave
sites synchronize on their own because the synchronization would
produce pending changes on the slave site. These pending changes
will prevent future synchronizations from the master site and need
to be confirmed manually on the slave site to be able to sync again.

In previous versions the new sites were configured to synchronize
with LDAP on their own by default. It's recommended to change this
option to the intended default.

However, there are scenarios were it makes sense to set this option
to also perform the synchronization on the slave site with either
all configured LDAP connections or just some connections.
