Title: oracle_jobs: Bugfix for auto_drop=TRUE jobs

Class: fix

Oracle allows a definition of Scheduler-Jobs who are automatically
removed after the execution. They are ignored with this change.

Please update the mk_oracle plugin.

Incompatible Change: This change has an impact on existing Databases
because Oracle creates some jobs in SYS with auto_drop.
They are ignored with this Commit.
