Title: apc_inrow_system_events, liebert_system_events: Fixed handling of empty section
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1

Class: fix

If no events are reported for these two checks, the agent section
is empty and Check_MK marked the related services as 'vanished'.
An empty section is valid and these two checks can handle them
correctly.
