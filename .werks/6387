The VSphere special agent may provide piggyback data for other hosts.
Sometimes all piggybacked services on these hosts became stale because
the piggyback files were incorrectly detected as outdated.
Other piggyback hosts may also be affected.

Internal notes:
A piggyback host writes piggyback files and an additional status file.
The age of each piggyback file is compared to the age of the status file
in order to detect the validity of the piggyback file.
Wihtin the cachefile_age function the timestamp of 'now' is initialized
every time for every file. This may result in disregarded time deltas.
