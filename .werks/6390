Title: Check_MK service: The monitoring state for each missing section is configurable
Level: 1

Class: feature

Previously only the generic monitoring state was configurable
if {{some}} agent section were missing. But there was no
differentiation between these sections.

Now beside of setting the generic "Missing sections" state in the
ruleset {{State of the Check_MK services}} you can specify
a regex pattern to match specific section names and give them
an individual state in case they are missing.
Note that the first match is used.

The section name can be found in the {{Service check command}} row in
the details view of a service:
Without the prefix {{check_mk-}} and the suffix after the dot (incl.).

For example the section name of the service check command
{{check_mk-cpu.loads}} is {{cpu}}.

This applies only for passive check types.
