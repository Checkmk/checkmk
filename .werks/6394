Title: winperf_processor: Changed CPU utilization default levels to 90, 95 percent
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1533273978
Class: feature

Previously the default levels were set to 101, 101 percent
which is in most cases equivalent to 'no levels'.

These levels are configurable via the WATO rule
{{CPU utilization for simple devices}} and can be
disabled, too.

A rediscovery is required for affected hosts.
Please open and re-save the affected rules to avoid ineffective rulesets
in some particular cases.
