Title: Fixed 'Unhandled exception 452' in master control snapin if EC Daemon was disabled via 'omd config'
Level: 1
Component: omd
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1533709463
Class: fix

Workaround:
After setting MKEVENTD option in 'omd config' run 'cmk -U' in order
to update the core config.

Internal notes:
After disabling MKEVENTD via 'omd config' and 'omd start'
the tactical overview fails while contacting the mkeventd via
the socket tmp/run/mkeventd/status in order to gather information
about open and acknowledged events.

This happened because the core config was not updated via 'cmk -U'.
