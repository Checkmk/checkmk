Beginning from firmware version 8 the tx/rxwords are no longer available. Therefore,
the values from FCMGMT-MIB are used for the calculation of the received and transmitted
bytes per second in this case. However, the conversion of the octet string delivered
by SNMP was not performed properly and a conversion factor for the transition between
octets and words was missing. This lead to unrealistic values in the order of TB/s on
some devices. This werk corrects the conversion of the octet string and introduces the
missing conversion factor so that the correct port speeds are reported for new firmware
versions as well.
