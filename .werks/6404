Class: fix

In previous versions of oracle_undostat services for error messages could be
discovered. If e.g. the error message 'the account will expire soon; change
your password' was returned by mk_oracle two additional services were
discovered. Because mk_oracle did not deliver valid data for these services
the oracle_undostat check crashed for these additional services. With this
werk a check for the data delivered by mk_oracle is introduced which
will prevent the discovery of the invalid services.
