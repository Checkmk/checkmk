Title: mk_postgres, postgres_instances: output missing instance data

In the agent plugin mk_postgres a command line option for the output
of the postgres_instances check was missing. This resulted in missing
data for the postgres_instances checks.
To apply this fix the mk_postgres plugin on the affected hosts has to
be updated.
