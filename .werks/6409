Title: wmi.include: don't throw exepctions in the parse function

Class: fix

In previous versions the parse function provided in wmi.include
(used in different WMI checks like e.g. wmi_cpuload) raised
a MKCounterWrapped exception if a WMI timeout occured. This
leads to a crash during the service discovery when a timeout
occurs.

Now the parse function always returns valid data. If a timeout
occurs an empty table is added to the parsed data. The inventory
function can then easily check for empty tables. If on the other
hand the check function tries to access an empty table a
MKCounterWrapped exception is raised.
