Title: mknotifyd: set a default timeout if no value is given for a method

If the option "Timing settings for specific methods" was used for a notification
method and no explicit timeout was given an exception was raised in the mknotifyd
if a timeout occured. As a result notification processes that run in a timeout
are not killed, the list of notifications that are in progress are not updated
as long as the timed out process exists and the output of the timed out process
is discarded.

The issue is now fixed and the default timeout of 60s is set if no timeout
is specified in the global settings.

If you use the option "Timing settings for specific methods" in versions prior
to 1.5.0p8 please set a timeout explicitlyto circumvent this issue.
