Title: agent_3par: Prevent InsecureRequestWarning error when ignoring SSL cert issues
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
State: unknown
Version: 1.6.0b1

In previous 1.5 releases the 3par special agent could report errors like
this:

CRIT - [special_3par] Agent exited with code 1:
/omd/sites/debsg/lib/python/requests/packages/urllib3/connectionpool.py:852:
InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS request is being made. Adding
certificate verification is strongly advised. See

When a special agent is told to ignore SSL issues (like it's done always for
this agent) such warnings should be suppressed.
