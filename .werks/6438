When event canceling is used in a rule where it is possible that both, the
positive and canceling conditions match for a message, this resulted in a new
event in all previous 1.5 versions. However, the versions up to 1.4 always
treated this situation as a cancel event situation. The original behavior has
now been restored in this case.

This regression affects all previous 1.5 releases.
