With werk #5535 we changed the tag group "Agent type" to be a builtin tag
group. When a pre-1.5 site modified this tag group before updating to 1.5, this
tag group was left untouched.

In this situation hosts that were marked as "No agent" (ping only hosts) were
suddenly set to "Check_MK Agent (Server)" which resulted in error messages
in the monitoring after activating the configuration, because these hosts got
a Check_MK service and tried to contact the agent while there is none on the
affected hosts.

We have now changed the migration logic to extend the locally modified "Agent
type" tag group with the options Check_MK 1.5 needs. This change should make
your "No agent" hosts now stick with the intended configuration.

In case you are affected by this issue,  you may notice that the choices of the
"Agent type" are now extended with some new options which may be confusing in
the first moment. You can now navigate to the "Host tags" page in WATO and edit
the tag group "agent" to sort the new options according to your needs.

The tag choices in the tag group "Agent type" that are available in your site
after the update (that are not part of the 1.5 standard) are displayed with the
"Legacy: " prefix. This can be useful in the moment you want to clean them up.

To migrate the legacy choices you need to clean up all objects referring these
choices before they can safely be removed. Examples:

<ul>
<li>The legacy "No Agent" choice was using the Tag ID "ping". The new one uses
   the "no-agent" tag ID. You can now delete the legacy choice from the tag
   group and hit save. The GUI will then inform you about all hosts, folders
   or rulesets using this tag choice. Navigate to all objects and change the
   old setting to the new one. After that you can safely remove the legacy
   choice.</li>
<li>For the snmp-only, snmp-v1 and snmp-tcp options it's a bit more complicated
   because it involves now two tag groups (SNMP + Agent type). To use the new
   scheme you need to set the configuration like this:
   <ul>
   <li>snmp-only: Agent type = "No agent" and SNMP = SNMP v2 or v3</li>
   <li>snmp-v1: Agent type = "No agent" and SNMP = SNMP v1</li>
   <li>snmp-tcp: Agent type = "Contact either Check_MK Agent or use datasource program" and SNMP = SNMP v2 or v3</li>
   </ul>
</li>
</ul>
