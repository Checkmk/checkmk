Werk #6556 introduced a new option "use all enabled datasource programs" that can
be used to disable the TCP Check_MK agent and use all special agents / data source
programs to fetch the monitoring data for a host.

This new option was not applied correctly. The hosts using this option were monitored
like they had the option "Contact either Check_MK agent or use data source program"
configured.
