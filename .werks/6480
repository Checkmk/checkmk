Title: mk_oracle: Support for Container Database (Multitenant)
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1535002617
Class: feature

Oracle introduced the Containerdatabase (CDB) with 12c.

Important information for the monitoring user:
It is mandatory to create a specified user in Oracle.
Be aware that the prefix c## is only usable in a CDB and
it is not possible to use this user in non CDB (old setups!)

For Databases with CDB:
* <tt>create user c##check_mk identified by "secret";</tt>
* <tt>alter  user c##check_mk set container_data=all container = current;</tt>
* <tt>grant create session, select_catalog_role to c##check_mk container=all;</tt>

For Databases without CDB:
* <tt>create user check_mk identified by "geheim";</tt>
* <tt>grant create session, select_catalog_role to check_mk:</tt>

Incompatible Change:
The plugin is compatible against non CDB environments.
There was a work arround for monitoring 1 PDB inside a
CDB with the old version of mk_oracle. This will not
work anymore, because the plugin creates new output and
the checks creates new services.
Plese do a services Discovery in environments with the
work arround. Don't forget to change rules for changed
services.

Affected Services:
* oracle_instance
* oracle_jobs
* oracle_performance
* oracle_recovery_status
* oracle_sessions
* oracle_tablespaces
