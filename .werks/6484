In order to decide which check is used for which data source
we have to filter the found check plugins. This is done via
the check_info key "management_board". There are three values
with the following meanings:
- MGMT_ONLY
    These check plugins
    - are only used for management board data sources,
    - have the prefix 'mgmt_' in their name,
    - have the prefix 'Management Interface:' in their service description.
    - If there is an equivalent host check plugin then it must be 'HOST_ONLY'.

- HOST_PRECEDENCE
    - Default value for all check plugins.
    - It does not have to be declared in the check_info.
    - Special situation for SNMP management boards:
        - If a host is not a SNMP host these checks are used for
          the SNMP management boards.
        - If a host is a SNMP host these checks are used for
          the host itself.

- HOST_ONLY
    These check plugins
    - are used for 'real' host data sources, not for host management board data sources
    - there is an equivalent 'MGMT_ONLY'-management board check plugin.


Migration from 1.4 to 1.5:
in 1.4 TCP hosts with SNMP management boards discovered TCP and
SNMP checks, eg. uptime and snmp_uptime.  During checking phase
these checks should be executed
further on.
In versions >= 1.5 there are management board specific check
plugins, eg. mgmt_snmp_uptime.
After a re-discovery Check_MK finds the uptime check plugin for
the TCP host and the mgmt_snmp_uptime check for the SNMP
management board. Moreover Check_MK eliminates 'HOST_ONLT'
checks like snmp_uptime.
