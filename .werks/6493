The OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.5951.4.1.3.1.1.1 (vsvrName) is used
for the server names. At a certain length the names are
cryptic and therefore unreadable.

In order to get readable names we preferable use the OID
.1.3.6.1.4.1.5951.4.1.3.1.1.59 (vsvrFullName).

After a rediscovery the full server names will be used.
In general the server names and full server names are
equal below a certain length.
