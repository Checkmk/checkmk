Title: check_mk_agent.linux: Moved piggybacked docker container sections to plugin 'mk_docker_container_piggybacked'

In order to monitor docker containers the {{check_mk_agent}}
collects the following information of each docker container
as piggyback data:
<ul>
<li>The state, node name, labels and network information</li>
<li>Execution of the {{check_mk_agent}} within running containers</li>
</ul>

Moreover you have to create piggybacked hosts in Check_MK for each docker
container. The piggybacked host name is the docker container ID.

Due to a long running time of these sections they are transferred to the
plugin {{mk_docker_container_piggybacked}} which also can be executed
asynchronously.

That means that these sections were removed from the {{check_mk_agent}}
and you have to install the plugin to the plugins folder on the client.
