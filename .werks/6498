File group statistics such as
<ul>
<li>count</li>
<li>size</li>
<li>largest size</li>
<li>smallest size</li>
<li>oldest age</li>
<li>newest age</li>
</ul>
can be checked by upper and lower thresholds which consists of two values: warn
and crit. These levels are independent of each other.

In order to check dependent file group statistics you can configure
conjunctions of single levels now. A conjunction consists of a monitoring state
and any number of upper or lower levels. If all of the configured levels within
a conjunction are reached then the related state is reported.
