Title: Dropped libmcrypt / php-mcrypt dependency
Level: 1
Component: omd
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1

Class: feature

The libmcrypt library and the mcrypt php module is not necessary for Check_MK
and it's major components. We drop it because it is the last dependency on
RedHat distros that is fetched from the EPEL repositories. This means that we
can now skip this step during initial installation and thus simplify the
installation process on these systems a bit more.

The only component left that uses libmcrypt is the fairly old NSCA receiver
which is still shipped with Check_MK. We keep this component for the moment
since it's used by several installations and we currently have no 1:1
replacement for it. In case you need to use NSCAs encryption, which is highly
recommended when you use NSCA, you may have to install libmcrypt by hand to
make it work.
