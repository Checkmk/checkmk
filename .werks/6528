The hook as removed during 1.5 development (#5170). Since it is
useful to disable TMPFS especially when Check_MK sites are used
in container environments.

E.g. when using Docker tmpfs mounts in containers are only possible with
privileged containers or SYS_ADMIN capability. In this situation it is
better to turn off the TMPFS in the site and tell docker to mount a
tmpfs in the sites tmp directory during container creation
(e.g. using docker run --tmpfs /omd/sites/[site]/tmp).
