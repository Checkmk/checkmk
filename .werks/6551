Users with reduced privileges that have access to WATO e.g. for managing their
own hosts in specific folders have access to the "Activate changes" page for
activating their config changes. On that page there is a button "discard
changes" which can be used to undo the configuration changes that have been
made since the last activation.

A limitation of this feature is that it can only revert the whole configuration
at all, not only the configuration made by this user. A permitted user would
discard all changes, even the ones made by others in the moment he clicks on
discard changes.

The activation mechanism is aware of the situation where others have made
changes. Users that are not permitted to activate foreign changes are not
able to activate their changes in this situation and get a warning message
about this.

However, the discard changes action was missing such a check which allowed
those users to discard the changes of others while they should not be allowed
to do so.

The discard changes action is now using the same logic as the activate changes
action for checking whether or not a user is allowed to do this.
