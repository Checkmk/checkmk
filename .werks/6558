The global setting "View action defaults" can now be used to configure a default
expiration time for acknowledgements.

Please note that once you set a global default value other than 0, all acknowledgements
created in the future will have an expiration time unless the user overrides the
expiration time with 0 manually when setting an acknowledgement.
