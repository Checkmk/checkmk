During an "omd update" it is possible to switch between Check_MK Editions.  For
example to upgrade from Check_MK Raw Edition to Check_MK Enterprise Editions.
It happened that users were accidentally updating Check_MK Enterprise Edition
based sites with Check_MK Raw Editions which e.g. results in reduced
functionality and performance.

During updates OMD is now comparing the old and new Check_MK Editions and asks
the user for confirmation once a change of the edition is detected.
