All previous 1.5 releases used a partially broken counter / rate computation in
various checks in specific situations, e.g. inotify checks. Not all check
results were computed wrong, only the ones based on counter / rate
computations.

When a single check monitors several services on a host, only the first of
these services was affected by this issue.
