Title: mk_logwatch: options are no longer applied globally

Class: fix

Until this fix, a specified option had overwritten any previously defined values
 for said option, and was applied globally.
This has now been fixed: The scope of an option is limited to the files on the same line.
In case the same file is referenced in different lines, the options for this specific
 file are updated with the new ones, keeping the allready defined ones.
