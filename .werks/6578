Title: Agent access config can now be monitored
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1538054461
Class: feature

The functionality of the service "Check_MK Agent Access" has
been incorporated in the "Check_MK" service.
The corresponding global config option "check_mk_only_from_default"
will no longer work; please remove it from your main.mk file if
you have been using the service "Check_MK Agent Access".
From now on this feature can be configured via WATO using the
ruleset "Allowed IP addresses for agent access" - the same rule that
will be used for the agent bakery (if available).
The check state will be displayed as part of the "Check_MK" service.
