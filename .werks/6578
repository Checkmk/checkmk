Level: 1
Component: checks

The functionality of the service "Check_MK Agent Access" (which could be
enabled manually using the global setting check_mk_only_from_default, see
check_mk.only_from check) has been incorporated in the "Check_MK" service.

The corresponding global config option "check_mk_only_from_default" will no
longer work; please remove it from your main.mk file if you have been using the
service "Check_MK Agent Access".

From now on this feature can be configured via WATO using the ruleset "Allowed
IP addresses for agent access" - the same rule that was already available to
Agent Bakery users for configuring the IP restrictions for baked agents. This
ruleset is now available in all Checkmk Editions
The check state will be displayed as part of the "Check_MK" service.
