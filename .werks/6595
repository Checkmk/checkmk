The recognition works correct but not in the following situation
where the wrong network interface data is checked.
<ul>
<li><tt>Use desciption</tt> or <tt>use alias</tt> is configured in the
ruleset <tt>Network Interface and Switch Port Discovery</tt>.</li>
<li>Two or more network interfaces exist with same description or alias.</li>
<li>Only one network interface with this description or alias is discovered.</li>
<li>The discovered network interface does not rank first.</li>
</ul>

Now the index is attached if an alias or description exists at least twice.
