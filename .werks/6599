The active check {{Check_MK HW/SW Inventory}}, the
inventory history and the shell commands <tt>cmk -vi</tt>
and <tt>cmk -vii</tt> show the number of found entries.
This number also includes the amount of nodes. Example:
<tt>Hardware > System > Family: Thinkpad</tt>
gives 3 entries. This may be confusing.

Now only the real entries are counted. Example:
<tt>Hardware > System > Family: Thinkpad</tt>
gives 1 entry.
