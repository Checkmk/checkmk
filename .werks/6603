Title: CRE: Fixed Check_MK service crash if a check plugin is unknown to the check context
Level: 1
Component: checks

A host has discovered a set of check plugin names which are triggered by the
Check_MK service. If the agent type of this host changes without performing a
rediscovery afterwards and the configuration changes are activated then there
may be new or vanished check plugins which are unknown to the current check
context. This leads to a KeyError of the Check_MK service.

Now if a check plugin is unknown to the current check context Check_MK ignores
this check plugin. Aside from that the Check_MK Discovery service reports about
vanished or unmonitored serices.
