Class: fix

While parsing the winperf interface section only trailing spaces were stripped
off. There may also be leading spaces. Without cutting them off additional
information like NetConnectionID, GUID or MAC address of the interfaces were
not found. In this case the instance name of the interace was used as alias
(fallback) instead of the NetConnectionID.

Now if one has configured <tt>Use alias</tt> in the
<tt>Network Interface and Switch Port Discovery</tt> ruleset new services
may be discovered and old ones will be vanished.
In order to obtained the already used iterface names please use
<tt>Use description</tt> in the <tt>Network Interface and Switch Port Discovery</tt>
ruleset.
