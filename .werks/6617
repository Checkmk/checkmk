Besides the traditional operating system packages we are now providing Check_MK
as Docker container image to improve the support of using Check_MK in containerized
environments.

For the moment the Docker images are published together with the other Check_MK
packages on the versions download pages for manual download.

Future releases of the Check_MK Raw Edition will be published on Docker Hub
(https://hub.docker.com/r/checkmk/check-mk-raw/). On this page you can already
find some information on how to use the images. These instructions apply to all
Check_MK Editions.

The Enterprise and Managed Services Edition containers will also be available through
a docker image repository in the future. For the moment you will have to download and
import the images manually using <tt>docker load</tt>.
