Title: Add permission to prevent users from editing "Deploy custom files with agent" rule set

Using the rule set "Deploy custom files with agent" it is possible to select custom files
to be distributed with the agents built using the Agent Bakery. As this is rule set may
add custom executable code to the agents it makes sense to be able to control the permission
for this more explicitly.

If you want to make sure that administrative users can not add those custom files to the
agents, you can now use the rule set "Configure custom agent file deployments" to revoke
this permission.
