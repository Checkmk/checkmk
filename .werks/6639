Class: feature

It is now possible to for Check_MK to send notifications about state
changes of hosts and services into a Slack channel.

Slack needs to be first configured to recieve messages from Check_MK. This
can be done by setting up a Webhook <a href="https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/" target="_blank">here</a>,
where you specify which channel will recieve the notifications. In Check_MK,
under "WATO - Notifications", create a new notification rule. And select under
Notification Method Slack. Copy the URL that Slack gives you after completing
the configuration into the Slack Webhook-URL field. Optionally if you want sent
messages to include hyperlinks to Check_MK, enable the field URL prefix for
links to Check_MK.
