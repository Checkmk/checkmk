Class: fix

The process information delivered by the agent has been upgrated multiple times by requirements of users or information available from the OS. The ps agent tracked the memory outilization of a process by its name, but could not access information of process id and the time of life(elapsed time) of a running process, as such information was misplaced by the agent and thus ignored by the check. This fix brings this data into consideration by the check.
