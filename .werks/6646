Processes that where monitored on CPU utilization did not have a consistent
behavior. On windows systems 100% CPU utilization implied all cores in the
system where at max load. On other systems every core contributed with a
100% at full load, thus the maximum load was <b>N</b>*100%.

This was also inconsistent with the system wide CPU utilization check
where, 100% is all cores at full load.

Consistency is brought is this werk, where 100% is all cores at full load
by default. For backwards compatibility with previous configurations, where
threshold rules were explicitly configured, the old behavior continues to
be used until the user explicitly chooses a particular behavior. This will
be reminded in the rules overview.

This option is available under CPU rescale maximum load in the process
discovery rules and in state and count of processes.
