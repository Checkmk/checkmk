Check_MK now support native integration with Pager Duty and can send
notifications about state changes of hosts and services into a configured
Pager Duty service.

In Pager Duty a new integration service has to be set up. Select as
"Integration Type" Check_MK and configure your service as better suited for
your use case. Save the returned "Integration Key".

In Check_MK, under "WATO - Notifications", create an new notification rule
and select PagerDuty. Copy the "Integration Key" from Pager Duty as
parameter. Optionally you can save the integration key in Check_MK's
password manager and retrieve it here.  If you want incidents in Pager Duty
to include hyperlinks back to Check_MK, enable the field URL prefix for
links to Check_MK.
