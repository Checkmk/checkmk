Title: BI configuration: WATO slave sites without user login now also receive BI configuration changes

If a WATO slave site had no direct login access configured, it also did not receive any changes
within the BI configuration. As a result, BI checks running on the slave site never received
configuration updates in time. This has been fixed.
