Title: Introducing BI datasource program and get_bi_aggregations API call
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1541775502
Class: feature

This werks introduces the
<ul>
<li>Thew new Web API interface get_bi_aggregations</li>
<li>A datasource program, which uses this interface</li>
<li>Two checks bi_aggregation and bi_aggregation_connection, which evaluate the data</li>
</ul>

Monitoring of BI aggregations was already available with the active check <tt>Check state of BI aggregation</tt>.
This active check could only monitor one aggregation at a time and furthermore drastically slowed the Web GUI when
configured for multiple hosts. In some rare instances, when configured for hundreds of hosts it could also lock down
the GUI by occupying all available apache workers.

The purpose of this datasource program is to fetch all data in one call and distribute it to specific hosts via piggyback.
The use of the BI datasource program is the new recommended way when monitoring BI aggregations.


<h3>New API Interface: <tt>get_bi_aggregations</tt></h3>
Calling this API interface without any extra options returns a dictionary, which includes
a list of all aggregation and some additional information about unresponsive sites and unavailable aggregations
You can specify a filter dictionary which currently may have two different kind of filter types.

For example
<tt>"filter": {"names": ["Aggr HostA", "Aggr HostB"]}</tt><br>
<tt>"filter": {"groups": ["AggregationGroup1", "AggregationGroup2"]}</tt><br>
<tt>"filter": {"names": ["Aggr HostA"], "groups": ["AggregationGroup1"]}</tt>

You can find more information in our official documentation soon.


<h3>New datasource program: <tt>Check BI Aggregations via Web Interface</tt></h3>
The datasource program is configurable in WATO. It is able to contact multiple monitoring sites at the same time.
Each site can be configured indepedently. The configuration offers the following options
<ul>
<li>Filter fetched aggregations by regex and aggregation groups</li>
<li>Assign fetched aggregations to specific hosts via piggyback, for example all hosts which are affected by this aggregations</li>
<li>Rewrite of aggregation states, e.g. State if aggregation is in downtime, State if aggregation is acknowledged</li>
</ul>

<h3>New checks</h3>
There are two new checks.

<tt>bi_aggregation</tt> simply displays the state of the aggregation. It is not configurable
<tt>bi_aggregation_connection</tt> shows connections problems with the monitoring site(s).
