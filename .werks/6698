Title: The "Activates button" no longer cause performance issues when there are hundreds of open changes
Level: 1
Component: wato
Class: fix

If there are more than 10 changes in the WATO configuration the button simply states <tt>10+ changes</tt>,
instead of digging through the whole configuration till it gets the exact number.
