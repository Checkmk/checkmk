Title: Introduced various performance improvements for cmc config generation (e.g. multiprocessing)
Level: 2
Component: cmc
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1548418345
Class: feature

Previous versions only used one CPU core for the config generation.
The time to generate the config highly depends on the number of hosts, services and especially rulesets.

Lots of the underlying computation code has been changed, caches and functions were optimized.
As a result Check_MK is now able to distribute the work load of the config generation over several CPUs.

Per default, this feature is activated. Unless configured otherwise, it uses up to 75% of the available
CPUs during the config generation, leaving some CPUs for running monitoring core.
A new configuration option <tt>Generate monitoring configuration via multiprocessing</tt> has been introduced.
You can either switch of multiprocessing or configure the number of used CPUs manually.

Tests have shown that the performance can increased by a factor of 5-10 on a 8 CPU core setup.
