The SLA information is no longer shown per default, since its empty most of the time.
If you want to reenable this painter, just edit the view and add one of the following columns.

<ul>
<li>Host/Services: SLA column specific</li>
<li>Host/Services: SLA service specific</li>
</ul>

Keep in mind that you still have to configure a SLA configuration before this column can display any meaningful data.
