Different check_types may have the same service description, for example <tt>CPU utilization</tt>.
If you created a <tt>Disabled check</tt> rule for some SNMP based CPU utilization check and
used the service discovery page, a <tt>Disabled service</tt> rule was automatically created for this SNMP
based check. As a side effect, the TCP based CPU utilization check was disabled as well..
