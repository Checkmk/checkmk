The crash reporting functionality of the GUI, which shows a lot of detailed
information about the internal state of the GUI, has been limited to be shown
only to permitted users.

The crash report could be used by attackers to get internal information about
the application state and secrets processed by the GUI.

All not permitted users will now only see a short message about the occurred
crash. Some more information is written to <tt>var/log/web.log</tt>.

Only authenticated administrative users are allowed to see and submit crash
reports by default.

If you like to give all your users the right to see and send crash reports give
them the permission "See crash reports"

A problem with this change may be that some crashes occur only in very specific
situations, for example for specific users. In such a case it may be hard to
get detailed information about the situation when the crash reporting is not
available. We plan to add an improved crash reporting in future versions to
make all occurred crashes available to the Check_MK administrator for later
debugging.
