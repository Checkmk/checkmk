A new option "SNMP trap processing" has been added to the Event Console log setting.

This setting is currently used in the following ways:

<ul>
<li>It controls the log level of all SNMP related log messages. Previously some
of the SNMP messages were controlled through the "Processing of incoming
events" setting.</li>
<li>Nothing is logged in <i>Informational</i> log level</li>
<li>When set to <i>Verbose</i> it shows details about which traps are received
by the Event Console and how they are handled on protocol level (whether they
are accepted or dropped).</li>
<li>When set to <i>Debug</i> it tells the underlying SNMP library (PySNMP) to
write it's debug output to the <tt>var/log/mkeventd.log</tt>. Please be careful
with this level. It may result in a lot of log output when you set it to debug
for instances which receive a lot of SNMP traps.</li>
</ul>
