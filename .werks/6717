Check_MK contains a lot of open source software. The licensing and copyright of
each package can now be found in a central CSV file. This file is located in
<tt>share/doc/Licenses.csv</tt> in each released version. You can find the file
of your local default version e.g. at <tt>/omd/versions/default/share/doc/Licenses.csv</tt>.

The latest file is always available in the git at <tt>omd/Licenses.csv</tt> which
is also available via the git browser
<a href="https://git.mathias-kettner.de/git/?p=check_mk.git;a=blob;f=omd/Licenses.csv">here</a>.
