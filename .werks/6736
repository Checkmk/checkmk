Status data inventory is not executed for Check_MK clusters
because they do not have own data sources for which status data
inventory is reasonable.
If status data inventory should be done for the related nodes
then you enable {{Status data inventory}} wihtin the ruleset
{{Do hardware/software Inventory}} for these nodes.
