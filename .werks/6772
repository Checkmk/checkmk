The LDAP synchronization was rewriting the user configuration during
every synchronization, even when no change has been made to the user
configuration.

This needless operation resulted in subsequent load because some
processes, like the Check_MK alert and notify helper were reloading
their configuration in case of a changed Check_MK config file.
