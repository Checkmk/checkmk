When requesting pages from the GUI a <tt>Content-Security-Policy</tt> is now been set in the HTTP
response. Using this mechanism the application can tell the browser which things are allowed to
be done by the web page in the context of the browser.

We are now, for example limiting the URLs where AJAX calls can be made to or the URLs which can
be used as form targets. This helps to prevent some XSS and other injection attacks.

The configuration of this policy is made in the apache configuration file
<tt>etc/apache/conf.d/security.conf</tt>. In case you want to have a look at the details or
want to extend the policy somehow you may edit the file in the context of your site configuration.
To apply the changes you need to restart your site apache using <tt>omd restart apache</tt>.

In case of trouble please let us know. We can probably adapt the default configuration to solve
common issues with this policy for all users.

One thing that may affect users that include Check_MK pages on other web pages using frames or
iframes: We set the <tt>frame-ancestors</tt> option to <tt>'self'</tt> which means that only pages
with the same protocol, url and port as the Check_MK page may refer to Check_MK pages. You can
extend this statement with the URLs you want to allow.
