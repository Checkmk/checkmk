Title: Notification spooler: Fixed file path traversal vulnerability
Level: 2
Component: notifications
Class: security
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
State: unknown
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1539847243

The notification daemon of one site connects to the notification daemon of another site
to exchange notifications between both sites.

The notification daemon was not validating the incoming data correctly which made it possible
for an attacker that has access to the notification sending site to compromise the receiving
site.

Using this vulnerability it was possible to write write files in directories that are writable
by the receiving site user. This could be used to gain access to the site.
