Title: Allow overriding of active and custom checks by more specific rule
Level: 1

Class: fix

If you define an active or custom Check via WATO in the main folder and
then want to override this check in a subfolder, that was not possible up
to now. Now if you define an active check <b>with the same type and service
description</b> by a more specific rule, then that rule will override the
more general ones (i.e. those coming later).
