Title: HW/SW Inventory history: Display the whole row if there are any changes

The HW/SW Inventory history shows new, changed or removed entries. If there are
changed entries in one row in a list Check_MK version 1.5.0p9 only shows these
changes. This is a regression because the previous stable version 1.4.0
displayed not only the changed entries, but also the unchanged entries in order
to refer to the right row.

Example:
Check_MK 1.4.0 displays all entries of a changed row in the package list:
{{libtiff5, 4.0.8, x86_64, deb, 2+deb9u2 -> 2+deb9u4}}

but Check_MK 1.5.0p9 only shows {{2+deb9u2 -> 2+deb9u4}}.
