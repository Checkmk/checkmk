Title: df mounts: Skip squashfs filesystems
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1539336597
Class: fix

The filesystem squashfs is a read-only filesystem and is therefore not monitored.
This makes the df and mounts checks ignore e.g. the mounts that are created for
snaps in newer Ubuntu versions.
