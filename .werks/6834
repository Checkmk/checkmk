Class: feature

Add an option to exclude space reserved for the <tt>root</tt> user from
the calculation of used space, to produce metrics matching the ouput of
the unix df command.
By default Check_MK treats space that is reserved for the <tt>root</tt> user on
Linux and Unix as used space. Usually, 5% are being reserved for root when a new
filesystem is being created.
With this new option in the ruleset "Filesystem (used space and growth)" you can
have Check_MK exclude the current amount of reserved but yet unused space from
the calculations regarding the used space (absolute and percentage).
