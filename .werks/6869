Some Windows checks may produce invalid UTF-16 symbols or symbols
which are difficult to convert into UTF-8 using standard library. 
As a result the Agent may crash with exception 'range_error' during 'to_bytes' call.

Now in such cases the Agent uses native Win32 API call avoiding the crash.
Provided output from above mentioned Win32 API call  conforms to the UTF-8 standard.
