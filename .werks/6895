Title: hp_msa_volume: Use volume-name as item identifier
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1542637650
Class: fix

Previously the durable-id has been used as identifier of items for the
check hp_msa_volume (and its sub checks io and df). The durable-id is not
guaranteed to be unique for different controllers of a volume. This werk
changes the unique identifier for items from durable-id to volume-name.
As soon as a discovery is executed the hp_msa_volume check items appear
with volume-name.
