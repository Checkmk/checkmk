To enable components to connect to external resources in proxied networks
more easily it is now possible to configure several HTTP proxies using the
global setting "HTTP proxies".

Imagine a scenario where your monitoring server is located in your company
internal network and you need to make a connection to a external HTTP server
in the internet while you can only connect to this server using a proxy server.
In the past the most spread option is to set the HTTP(S)_PROXY environment
variables for such a call and hope that the program you use for the connection
supports these envrionment variables.

Now it is possible to configure the proxies using the GUI in a central place
and refer to these settings from different parts of your configuration.

These proxies will be usable by e.g. special agents, notification scripts and
active checks, which need to use a proxy for their work.

As example the pushover notification script has been migrated to support the
global proxy settings.

Note to notification script developers: You have to name the
notification proxy element of the Dictionary parameters valuespec
"proxy_url" to make it work as expected with globally configured
proxies.

Note to special agent and active check developers: There is a new
function available get_http_proxy(http_proxy). Pass the
"http_proxy" value a user configured using the HTTPProxyReference
valuespec to this function an you will get back the proxy URL as string
or None in case no proxy should be set via command line (see "pydoc
cmk_base.check_api.get_http_proxy_for_cmdline" for further information).
