The service discovery page of the configuration GUI could end up
in timeouts when working with devices that need a long time to
process the discovery process. This mostly affected either large
or slow responding SNMP devices.

The discovery page is now initially loading almost immediately
and then starts fetching the content in the background. The
potential long running tasks (full scan or autmatic refresh) are
performed in the background. While these actions are performed,
the GUI shows the already known check table in a read only mode.

Discovering services of hosts monitored by remote sites using a
pre 1.6 version is possible but can still end up in timeouts. The
new logic is only used by sites using version 1.6 or newer.
