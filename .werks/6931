Title: cmk-update-agent.exe: Fix problem with missing Runtime Library
Level: 1
Component: agents
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
State: unknown
Version: 1.4.0p38
Date: 1542885280

Regression since 1.4.0p37 and 1.5.0

On some older Windows Systems and on Systems without a VC++ Runtime Library 2008 (or newer)
installed, the cmk-update-agent.exe may crash, showing an error like <code>Error loading Python DLL</code>.

We intend to ship a correct version of the needed runtime library within the executable, but this mechanism
got broken, caused by a sublte change in our build system.

With this werk, the correct DLLs get packaged within the executable and <code>cmk-update-agent.exe</code>
will work again as intended on affected systems.
