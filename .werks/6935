This werk introduces some improvements in the postinstall- and postuninstall-routines
for Solaris agent packages that come from the agent bakery:
<ul>
<li>Properly remove the installed inetd service. This has been done incompletely
before, which could lead to problems on reinstallation.</li>
<li>simplified syntax in order to avoid errors like <code>/var/sadm/pkg/check-mk-agent/install/postinstall: !: not found</code>
on some Solaris systems.</li>
<li>some improvements in timing and robustness.</li>
</ul>
