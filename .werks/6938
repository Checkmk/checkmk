Title: cmk-update-agent: Handle failing package manager
Level: 1
Component: agents
Class: fix

This werk fixes two bugs that occur on Unix and Linux
when the invoked package manager fails to install an
agent package:

The agent updater saved the agent hash to its state file
immediately before the update takes place. As a result, an
agent package got recognized as installed even if
its installation failed.

(Regression since Check_MK 1.5) Due to inproper handling
of the stderr and stdout streams coming from the invoked
package manager, the agent updater crashed on a package
manager failure instead of forwarding the error messages
to the user or log.
