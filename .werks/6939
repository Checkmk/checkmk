Title: Improve agent updater start script compatibility on Solaris
Level: 1
Component: agents
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1548240334
Class: fix

The agent updater start script (located at /usr/bin/cmk-update-agent)
is now compatible to older shells like the default sh on Solaris 10.

Please note that you still need a python 2.7 installation and corresponding
packages "requests" and "pyOpenSSL" in order to run the agent updater
on Solaris. You can obtain these software packages e.g. via the
"OpenCSW" project using the "pkutil" tool.
