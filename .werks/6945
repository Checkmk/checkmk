Title: mk_filestats: Plugin to monitor files (Count, Age, Size)
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1544539302
Class: feature

A new plugin is introduced with a functionality similar to fileinfo.
It reports count, size and age of sets of files specified using a
globbing pattern.
However, this plugin is designed with large filesets in mind.
It therefore provides different options to reduce the data reported to
the Check_MK server and/or to avoid unnecessary stat calls on the client.
For more information, please refer to the "--help" option of the plugin
and the example configration file in agents/cfg_examples.
