Level: 2
Component: deb
Compatible: compat

Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1544098646
Class: fix

Caused by a recent change, the .deb packages inadvertendly contained some
build artifacts, resulting in some files being installed below /bauen.  The
1.5.0 releases p8 and p9 were affected, but not p7 and earlier.  This has
been fixed.
