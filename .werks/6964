Livestatus and CMC can use one of two regex engines: Either then one from
the C++11 standard library or the one from the RE2 library.  Normal builds
ship the latter, only a manually built Livestatus should ever use the
former.  Nevertheless, both should work, but the C++11 variant had a quoting
bug, resulting in incorrect matching. This has been fixed.
