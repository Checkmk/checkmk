Title: Fixed macro expansion in Livestatus

Unterminated dollar signs were handled incorrectly: The part of the text
before such a dollar sign was repeated, e.g. "foo$bar" was incorreclty
expanded to "foofoo$bar", although it should remain unchanged.  This
affected only the Livestatus NEB, not the CMC.
