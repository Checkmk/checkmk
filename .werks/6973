<ul>
<li>If you only had fileinfo config files below fileinfo.d/, but not
fileinfo.cfg, the former ones were ignored.</li>
<li>Spaces in the paths to the config files and within the patterns itself
did not work.</li>
<li>Brace expansion and tilde expansion in patterns did not work.</li>
<li>The config files can now contain comment lines in the usual syntax, i.e.
lines starting with some optional whitespace, optionally followed by a hash mark
and a comment.</li>
<li>Date variables work in all agents now.</li>
</ul>
