Title: docker_node_disk_usage, docker_node_info, docker_node_images, docker_node_network: Extract sections to plugin

Due to poor performance of commands such as <tt>docker system df</tt> in some environments, the
check_mk_agent would be slowed down to the point of unusability. To address this, these sections
have been extracted into the <tt>mk_docker_node</tt> agent plugin, allowing them to be run asynchronously.

If you update the agent and you need these sections, you will have to deploy the plugin to continue
monitoring docker node information.
