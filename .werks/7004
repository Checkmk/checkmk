Title: oracle_tablespaces: added support for temporary Tablespaces
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1547114074
Class: feature

It is possible to define rules for temporary Tablespaces. Please use the most
current mk_oracle plugin, because old versions are not working. Be warned that
monitoring of temporary Tablespacess could create some trouble, due to
asynchronous execution of the Tablespace usage.
The check ignores by default all temporary Tablepspace.

Add 'temptablespace': True to the dictionary of the rule.
