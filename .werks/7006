Title: mk_oracle: Support for policy managed Database
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1547539497
Class: feature

The plugin is able to work with Grid-Infrastructure and Oracle Restart for
Version 12.2+. There is no guarantee that the oratab has valid entries anymore.
In most configurations the data for ASM and instances are missing from 18c
onwards. The plugin reads the ORACLE_HOME from the cluster registry. This also
makes the plugin compatible for Clusters with policy managed databases, which
was not supported in previous versions. Mostly known in environments with '_1'
at the end of the ORACLE_SID in oratab.

Incompatible Change:
Please be aware that this feauture must be disabled in installations with
Oracle Grid Infrastructure and custom scripts for Failover Clusters. These type
of installation is rare and need a valid configuration in oratab and as a
result the automatic gathering of ORACLE_HOME from the cluster repository must
be disabled. Please set the variable OLRLOC in mk_oracle.cfg to a non existing
file or /dev/null to disable this feauture. Real Application Clusters or Oracle
Restart with version 11.2+ are not affected. Please disable it for CRS
10.1-11.1 as well. This change can be ignorred in normal single Instance
installations without Grid Infrastructure or Oracle Restart - mostly known as
installations without ASM.
