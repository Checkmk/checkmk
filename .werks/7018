Title: Livestatus can now be configured to connect via IPv6
Level: 2
Component: multisite

Class: feature

In previous versions it was not possible to connect the GUI to a remote site
via Livestatus using IPv6. This is now possible and can be configured from the
"Distributed Monitoring" configuration.

Technically this was prevented by several smaller things.

The internal Livestatus xinetd configuration now allows ::/0 besides 0.0.0.0 by
default. In case you have modified this setting and want to use IPv6, you may
have to add the IPv6 addresses of your choice to this option.

The site configuration GUI is now able to handle IPv6 addresses properly.

The internally used livestatus.py Livestatus client implementation supports
IPv6 now. Livestatus proxy can now connect to Livestatus via IPv6 and also the
cascading proxy feature, which is used to make the local unix socket of a site
available via the network, can now be used with IPv6 in addition to the already
existing IPv4 support.
