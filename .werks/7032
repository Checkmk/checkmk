Title: logwatch: Optional shared log pointer for several ip addresses

Class: feature

Previous Check_MK versions potentially showed duplicate log file entries
in case the monitoring setup used a failover cluster configuration (cluster
consisting of at least 2 cluster nodes, each running a Check_MK instance
and providing Check_MK via virtual host).

This werk adds support for an optional shared log pointer between several
requesting IP addresses. This prevents from potentially duplicate log file entries.

The mapping of cluster node IP addresses to a cluster name may be configured
either manually by editing the logwatch configuration file or via the agent bakery.

Users of the configuration file logwatch.cfg and/or files logwatch.d/*.cfg may
configure a mapping according to the syntax described in
agents/cfg_examples/logwatch.cfg for configuration.

Users of the agent bakery may use the ruleset "Text logfiles (Linux, Windows)"
option "Specify a mapping of cluster node IPs to a cluster name (failover cluster)".
