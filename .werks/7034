Class: fix

Previously the configuration of logfile patterns (like e.g. /var/log/*) which
matched directories lead to errors during parsing of logfiles because directories
have not been skipped. This werk adds filtering of directories and limiting of parsing
to files (inlcuding soft linked and hard linked ones).
