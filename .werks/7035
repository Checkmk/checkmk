Title: lnx_thermal: Fixed crash caused to unusual outputs
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1550502831
Class: fix

Previously the check crashed in case the agent delivered thermal zone data with
various degrees of details. This werk takes into account that these
heterogeneous formats can occur and prevents the check additionally to crash
due to invalid or currently unknown data formats.
