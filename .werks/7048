Title: mem.linux: Optional levels for corrupted memory configurable
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1552403287
Class: feature

Previously the check status was either OK in case no RAM was corrupted or a
custom check status (default: CRIT) in case RAM was corrupted dependent on the
configuration of WATO rule Memory Swap usage on Linux, value Handle Hardware
Corrupted Error. Now it is possible to configure the WARN and CRIT levels
for the corrupted memory with the renamed WATO value Hardware Corrupted.
Existing configurations of WATO rule value Handle Hardware Corrupted Error are
converted to WATO rule value Hardware Corrupted (1, 1) for consistent behaviour.
