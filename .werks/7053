On some systems the ss command used for the tcp_conn_stat check
introduced latency problems. To resolve this issue by default
now "cat /proc/net/tcp /proc/net/tcp6" is used again. ss is only
used as a fallback if cat runs into a timeout.

Additionally, the maximum waiting time for cat is reduced from
10s to 5s and SIGTERM is sent by waitmax instead of SIGHUP.
