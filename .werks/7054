Title: agent_vsphere, esx_vsphere_hostsystem.multipath: use new API endpoint
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: feature

For ESX versions above or equal to 6.5 the API endpoint "multipathState"
does not deliver sufficient data for the subcheck esx_vsphere_hostsystem.multipath
which may lead to a wrong output of the subcheck. Therefore, the subcheck now
uses the "multipathInfo" API endpoint instead.

For ESX versions below 6.5 which already use the ID of a LUN as an item
no further actions are necessary. For new ESX version which use an item
like e.g. "L0 physical" a service rediscovery is necessary. After the
rediscovery new ESX versions will use the ID of a LUN as an item as well.
