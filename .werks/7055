Werk 6901 introduced an additional word "MBean" in the item of
jolokia_generic checks. This changed the service description
to "MBean text1 MBean text2". This werk reintroduces the old
service description "MBean text1 text2".

If you have services that contain two times the word "MBean"
a service rediscovery is necessary to obtain the old format.
