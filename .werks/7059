Title: Add an option to reduce the logging in the notify.log

Class: feature

By default two lines are added for every notification rule in the
notify.log. They contain a short description of the rule and
information why the rule does or does not match. In setups with
a large number of notification rules this may result in up to
hundreds of lines in the notify.log for every incoming raw
notification. To optionally reduce the amount of logging this
werk introduces a new log level that only adds lines for matching
rules. The new option can be selected in the Global Settings under
"Notification log level". Be aware that with this option the
notify.log does not conain information about rules which do not
match which makes it much harder to analyze why a certain rule
did not match retrospectively.
