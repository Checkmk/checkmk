When using the environment option CMK_PASSWORD to set an initial password,
the previous docker containers showed the default "welcome message" after
site creation with a random initial password. The initial password was set
afterwards leaving the missleading password in the log.

The initial password is now set during site creation which makes the output
don't show the wrong password anymore.
