Since werk #5224 (1.5.0i1) it was possible to configure the HTTP active check
to print out verbose output. The intention was to let it write it's information
to the long output.

The problem is that the verbose output of the check_http active check does not
work this way. Instead of producing long output, it prints out it's verbose output
before the regular check result output. For this reason the verbose output will be
treated as regular plugin output. This can result in random performance data which
is then processed by the core and results in garbage RRD data filling up the disk
space.
