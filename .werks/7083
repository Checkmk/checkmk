The site apache reports information about the running software and platform to
the HTTP clients with each HTTP response using the "Server" HTTP header. It is
common practice to minmize this information using the apache configuration
option "ServerTokens Prod" which we do now for the site apache by default.

We don't modify this setting for the system wide apache. You'll have to
configure the system apache on your own in case you want to configure it to
work in the same way.
