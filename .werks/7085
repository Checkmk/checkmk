Title: Fixed parsing of special syslog messages which don't contain a host name
Level: 1
Component: ec
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1550050614
Class: fix

The Event Console is now able to process syslog messages that don't contain the
host name field. An example for such a message is this one:

C+:
Feb 13 08:41:07 pfsp: The configuration was changed on leader blatldc1-xxx to version 1.1366 by blatldc1-xxx/admin at 2019-02-13 09:41:02 CET</tt>
C-:

In previous versions messages like this resulted in log messages like this in
the event console log (var/log/mkeventd.log):

C+:
2019-02-13 09:41:07,338 [40] [cmk.mkeventd.EventServer] Got non-syslog message "Feb 13 08:41:07 pfsp: The configuration was changed on leader blatldc1-xxx to version 1.1366 by blatldc1-xxx/admin at 2019-02-13 09:41:02 CET" (need more than 1 value to unpack)

A fallback event was created that had no syslog fields set and contained the
whole unparsed syslog message in the text field.  If you have EC rules matching
on this fallback event, you will have to change these rules to match the parsed
event fields.

Now that the parsing has been added, events created by such a syslog message now
have the fields set as follows for our example:

C+:
application: pfsp
core_host:
facility: 1
host: 127.0.0.1
host_in_downtime: False
ipaddress: 127.0.0.1'
pid: 0
priority: 5
text: The configuration was changed on leader blatldc1-xxx to version 1.1366 by blatldc1-xxx/admin at 2019-02-13 09:41:02 CET
time: 1550043667.0
C-:

Please note that the EC uses the sender IP addresse of the syslog message to populate the host field.
