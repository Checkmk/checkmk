Locally installed localization files (local/share/check_mk/locale) may
now extend the builtin localizations instead of overriding them.

In previous versions the local locale file had to contain all texts that
we ship with our standard localizations, for example the german localization
in case one wanted to extend / change a single text.

Now both, the builtin and local localization files are loaded. All texts
are searched in the local file and looked up in the builtin file as fallback
in case the text can not be found in the local file.
