Extension packages (MKPs) can now ship their own localization files in addition
to the standard localization file. With this change it is possible to split
different localization parts into separate files.

The GUI now recognizes the following localization file paths:

C+:
share/check_mk/locale/[LANG]/LC_MESSAGES/multisite.mo - Builtin, shipped with Check_MK.
local/share/check_mk/locale/[LANG]/LC_MESSAGES/multisite.mo - Site specific override, extension of builtin localization
local/share/check_mk/locale/packages/[PKG_NAME]/[LANG]/LC_MESSAGES/multisite.mo - Extension localization
C-:

The GUI searches these localization files from bottom to top when it searches for
a text to be localized.
