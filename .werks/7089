Title: Docker container: Simplified update procedure

The update procedure of the official Check_MK containers was a bit complicated
compared to the update procedure on other servers. The root cause for this was
that the update always required both, the old and the new versions, while the
containers are only allowed to have one version installed. This made it
necessary to create an intermediate container for the update.

The werk #7088 made it possible to perform an update without having access to
the old version. Once we have this functionality it is now possible to replace
one container with a another container. In case the version has changed, the
container is performing the update during startup of the new container.

The simplified update procedure can be used for Docker container updates to
version 1.6 or newer when the previous version is 1.5.0p13 or newer.
