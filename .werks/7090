Title: Automatically lock users after 10 subsequent logon failures

Sites created with Check_MK 1.6 will be configured to automatically lock user
accounts that fail to log in 10 times in a row. Existing sites will not be
affected by this change.

Check_MK already had the option to configure this feature for a long time. It
can be customized using the global setting "Lock user accounts after N logon
failures". If you have configured this in your setup, your setting is left
untouched.

To unlock automatically locked users, you need to login as administrative user
and disable the option "Disable password" for this user. In case your
administrative account was locked out, you will have to reset the password
of your account (using <tt>htpasswd -m ~/etc/htpasswd [user-id]</tt>).
