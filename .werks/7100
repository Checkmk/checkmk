In order to make the SAP HANA checks work you have to install

If you have installed the old agent plugin then you have to
replace it with the new agent plugin and perform a rediscovery
of these hosts.

The old check plugins are not discoverable any more and show
the message WARN - "This check is deprecated. Please rediscover the
services of that host."
