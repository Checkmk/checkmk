SNMP scan functions have the task to filter out SNMP hosts
for which it's not worth trying to discover related services.

In order to achieve this every scan function tries
to find out the right device type by reference to
SNMP SysObjID and/or SNMP SysDescr.

The stormshield scan functions were not restrictive enough and
the result was that for every SNMP host the SNMP table
below .1.3.6.1.4.1.11256 was requested. This might led to
losses during service discovery of all SNMP devices.
