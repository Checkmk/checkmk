Normally each node is part of a single cluster host in Check_MK. Using the
ruleset {{Clustered services for overlapping clusters}} you can assign services
found on a node to different independent cluster hosts, so called overlapping
clusters. This was unregarded while executing clustered services checks on the
related clusters. This may result in wrong check results.

Example:
Each of the two clusters {{cluster1}} and {{cluster2}} has the nodes {{node1}}
and {{node2}}. On each node we have discovered a process {{Process ABC}}.
Within the ruleset {{Clustered services for overlapping clusters}} we assign
the service {{Process ABC}} from node {{node1}} to {{cluster1}}.

Now the service {{Process ABC}} which is assigned ot the cluster {{cluster1}}
processes the data of both nodes and may return a wrong check result in the
moment where {{node1}} AND {{node2}} have data for {{Process ABC}}.
