Title: mk_jolokia: connection timeout is now configurable
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: feature

Previously the connection timeout was hardcoded to 1 second, based on the assumption that the jolokia server is most likely the local host.
This assumption has been dropped, and the timeout can now be configured using the agent bakery or by adding (e.g.) "timeout=23.0" to your configuration file.
