Title: mk_docker.py: A new docker monitoring plugin
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1550048642
Class: feature

We introduce a new plugin for docker monitoring, 'mk_docker.py'.
It combines the functionality of the two deprecated plugins
'mk_docker_node' and 'mk_docker_container_piggybacked', while
adding more configuration options.

If you where using both plugins, you can use the new plugin in its
default configuration to replace them. If you have been using only
one of them, you can disable the opposite parts of the new plugin,
either by using the bakery rule "Docker node and containers" or via
the configuration file (please refer to the example files in
agents/cfg_examples for more details).

The previous rule "Piggybacked docker containers" is deprecated -
please set up a corresponding new one.

To deploy this plugin you must have the 'docker-py' python library
installed on the monitored system. You can install it using the
python package manager pip (using the shell command
"pip install docker-py").
