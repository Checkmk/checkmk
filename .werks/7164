Title: cmk-update-agent: Add timeout handling for connection to server
Level: 1
Component: agents
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1550475651
Class: fix

Previously, the connection from the agent updater to the Check_MK Server did
not handle timeouts. This could lead to situations where the agent updater
would run forever waiting for a response.

This was particularly noticeable when running the agent updater under Windows,
because the agent updater would fail to start over again, showing an error
like <code>copying plugins\cmk-update-agent.exe to temp\cmk-update-agent.exe failed</code>.

The agent updater now will cancel the connection if it freezes. The timeout
limit is set to 120 seconds. This handling does not limit the overall connection time.<br>
For a detailled explenation have a look at the <i>Timeouts</i> paragraph at the
<a href="http://docs.python-requests.org">requests documentation</a>!

Please note: This timeout is only active for connections handled by python-requests.<br>
This fix won't apply if you are running the agent updater using cURL.
(i.e. you are running the Check_MK Agent Updater 1.4 on a Linux/UNIX host and
there is no python-requests module installed.)
