Title: cmk-update-agent: Improved error handling
Level: 1
Component: agents
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
State: unknown
Version: 1.6.0b9
Date: 1567684715

Previously, the agent updater might crash with a meaningless error
like <pre>ERROR compile() expected string without null bytes</pre>
when it tries to read from a corrupt config or state file.

This is now mitigated by showing a meaningful error that refers to
the file that caused the problem.
