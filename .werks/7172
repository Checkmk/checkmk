This werk fixes the following bug:

Automatic agent updates are failing on Solaris. The agent updater will remove the old agent
package and fail to install the newly downloaded package, leaving the Checkmk agent uninstalled.
Along with some further information, you can find the message
<pre>pkgadd: ERROR: unable to determine the current working directory, errno=2</pre>
at <code>/var/lib/check_mk_agent/cmk-update-agent.log</code>.
This only affects automatic updates, i.e. <code>cmk-update-agent</code> is invoked as
a plugin. Manually triggered updates are not affected by this bug.

Providing that the agent didn't get uninstalled accidentely, you can fix the automatic agent
updates functionality by triggering an update to a newly baked agent manually by invoking
<code>cmk-update-agent -v</code> on the affected hosts.
