Title: Apache: Disable TRACE and OPTIONS methods
Level: 1
Component: omd

The HTTP method TRACE makes some kind of reflection attacks possible and is not
used at all. It has been enabled for the site apache using the option
<tt>TraceEnable Off</tt> in etc/apache/conf.d/security.conf.

The similar TRACK method is not supported by the site apache at all, so it does
not have to be disabled.

A lot of guides recommend to also disable the OPTIONS method for production
servers.  This HTTP method basically reports which HTTP Methods that are
allowed on the web server. In reality, this is rarely used for legitimate
purposes, but it may grant a potential attacker a little bit of help and it
can be considered a shortcut to find another hole. For this reason we also
disabled the OPTIONS method.
