When adding a new metric to a service, the metric system automatically renders this metric
as single graph until a graph definition is added that renders this metric. In this moment
the automatically rendered metric is hidden.

This logic only worked for metrics that already have a metric_info definition. Now, if
you add a new metric without specifying a metric_info for it, but add it to a graph_info,
the automatically created single metric graph will now also be hidden.
