There was a bug in the permission checking logic of the get_all_hosts API call. In case one
tried to create a "read only" for exporting all hosts, this was not possible without the write
permission.

The following permissions should be needed:

<ul>
<li>Use Multisite at all</li>
<li>Access to Web-API</li>
<li>Use WATO</li>
<li>Read access to all hosts and folders</li>
</ul>

In previous versions the permission "Write access to all hosts and folders" was needed in
addition.
