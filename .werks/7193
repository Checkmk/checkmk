Title: Background jobs: Fixed possible "pid" KeyError exception

When background jobs terminated during initialization, the status
information of the job was missing necessary information which
led to exceptions in the status overview of the jobs and the
job cleanup code.

In case you experienced such an issue in previous versions, you
could remove the state files from <tt>var/check_mk/background_jobs/[job]/jobstatus.mk</tt>
to temporarily fix the problem.
