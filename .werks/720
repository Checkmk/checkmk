Title: Fix timeperiod computation with CMC and flexible notifications
Level: 1
Component: notifications
Version: 1.2.4p1
Date: 1393342421
Class: fix

If you used the Check_MK Micro Core and flexible notifications and
used the state of a timeperiod as a notification condition then
this condition would fail. Timeperiods would be computed just once
after every configuration restart. This has been fixed now.
