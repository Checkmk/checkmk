7202 Elasticsearch Monitoring

A special agent and first checks to support monitoring of Elasticsearch cluster, nodes and indices.

With this werk it is possible to monitor the cluster and node states of an elasticsearch instance.

LI: elasticsearch_cluster_health: State of the cluster (eg. green/yellow/red), Name, Number of nodes, Number of data nodes
LI: elasticsearch_cluster_health.shards: Number of shards in different states
LI: elasticsearch_cluster_health.tasks: Pending tasks, Task max waiting, Time out of tasks
LI: elasticsearch_nodes: Total virtual memory, CPU usage, Number of open file descriptors of nodes

For each check it is possible to set parameter in the associated WATO rule.
Checks for Cluster, Indices and Shard statistics follow soon.

Thanks to Fabian Binder for creating the initial version of the agent and checks!
