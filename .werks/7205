Title: jolokia_jvm_threading: new check for JVM threads
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1

Class: feature

The new check jolokia_jvm_threading is introduced. It creates the services
"JVM <instance> Threading" and optionally "JVM <instance> ThreadPool <pool name>",
replacing the former checks jolokia_metrics.threads and jolokia_metrics.tp.

The new "JVM Threading" check now allows to set rules on the thread count as well as on
the rate at which new threads are created. Additionally levels for the daemon threads
can be configured.
Unlike for the old check 'jolokia_metrics.threads', no default levels are imposed
on the thread count.
Users who had a rule in place for the ThreadCount metric of the old check
need to set up a new rule "JVM threading".

The "JVM ThreadPool" check applies the same rule as the previous check did.

A rediscovery is required for affected hosts.
