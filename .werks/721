Title: Use hard states in BI aggregates

Class: feature

Check_MK BI is now able to base the computation of the state of a BI aggregate
on hard states of hosts and services. This is a new option at the top level
of a BI aggregate. In WATO this is a new check box in each aggregation called
<i>Base state computation on hard states</i>.

When you edit your BI aggregates with a text editor then simply prefix
your aggregation entries with the keyword <tt>HARD_STATES</tt>. Here
is an example:

F+:etc/check_mk/multisite.d/mybi.mk
host_aggregations += [
  ( HARD_STATES, 'Hosts', FOREACH_HOST, ['tcp'], ALL_HOSTS, 'host', ['$1$']),
]
F-:

<b>Note 1</b>: Hard state only make sense if you have changed the <i>Maximum
Number of Check Attempts</i> of a host or service from the default value
of 1 to a higher value. If you have set the number of attempts to three
then the hard state of service remained OK until the service has been checked
three times in a row with a non-OK state.

<b>Note 2</b>: Please make sure that all of your monitoring sites are
updated to the same Check_MK version as your Multisite server. This new
BI features needs an up-to-date Livestatus implementation.
