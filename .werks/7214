Title: Interface checks: Introduce scan function API
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1552033415
Class: feature

In the past conflicting check plugins with services called "Interface <ITEM>"
could lead to a "duplicate services" warning on the discovery page.

To avoid this issue in the future, an API is now provided:

If you add a new "Interface <ITEM>"- service, please add register the
scan function by decorating it with the line
<tt>@network_interface_scan_registry.register</tt>.
The matching devices will then be automatically excluded from the generic
if and if64 check plugins.
