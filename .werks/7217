Class: fix

The order in which the HW/SW inventory plugins are executed is now deterministic.
Previously dependencies between inventory plugins could lead to missing data if
the plugins happend to be executed in the wrong order.

Plugins are now executed in alphabetical order by default. You can force a plugin
to be executed after another plugin by setting the <tt>depends_on</tt> key in
the inventory info variable <tt>inv_info</tt>. For instance writing
<tt>inv_info['plugin_a'] = {
    ...
    'depends_on' = ['plugin_b'],
}</tt>
will enforce "plugin_b" to be executed before "plugin_a".
