If users had the active check "Check HTTP" configured to check a certificate
via a proxy, the option "TCP Port" had wrongly been used as the proxys port
instead of the certificate servers port.

The port defined in the option "TCP Port" is now applied to the certificate
server, regardless of whether a proxy is used.

If you relied on the wrong behaviour, remove the option "TCP Port" and include
the port for the proxy in the proxy settings.
