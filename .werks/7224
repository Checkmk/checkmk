Class: fix

The "omd backup" mechanism recursively backups all site related
files of a Check_MK site. When files in a site directory, that
is currently being processed vanish, this could lead to failed
backups with errors like this:

C+:
Site backup failed: Traceback (most recent call last):

After this change the backup continues in such a situation
excluding the just vanished file.
