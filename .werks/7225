Title: Livestatus proxy: Transport site connect error to GUI
Level: 1
Component: liveproxy
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1551686561
Class: feature

Instead of always showing a plain "Site connection not initiated yet" message,
the GUI is now able to show a little more detailed connection error messages
from the livestatus proxy. This should make debugging of connection errors a
little easier.
