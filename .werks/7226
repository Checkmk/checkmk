Title: LXC: Add basic support for Linux containers
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1551686646
Class: feature

The agent is now detecting when it is executed in a Linux container
context and changes it's behaviour depending the environment.

In containers the agent currently does the following:

<ul>
<li>lxc_container_cpu: This check is used instead of the normal CPU
utilization check</li>
<li>zfs filesystems are not excluded for the df section anymore</li>
<li>kernel section is not processed, because it's the host systems
kernel the agent reports information for</li>
<li>drbd section is not processed for the same reason</li>
<li>lnx_thermal section is not processed for the same reason</li>
</ul>
