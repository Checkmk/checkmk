When "Use GIT version control for WATO" is enabled to keep track of the changes
that have been made to the Check_MK configuration, the history of the rules.mk
files was problematic because several contents of that file were not saved in a
deterministic way. This means that loading and saving the configuration without
chaning anything resulted in a changed file, e.g. because attributes of
dictionaries were not sorted.

The rules.mk is now stored in a deterministic way when "Use GIT version control for WATO"
is enabled.
