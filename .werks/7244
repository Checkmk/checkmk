Title: Restricted WATO sidebar snapin only show up to 10+ changes

The sidebar snapin and the WATO main page now use the same infotext to display the number of pending changes.
This infotext currently displays only up to 10 changes in detail. Any number above 10 is abstracted with the text <tt>10+ changes</tt>.
The reasoning behind this is, that there may be some sites with thousands of pending changes.
Determining the exact number generally takes some time, hereby slowing down the rending of any page showing this infotext.


The <tt>10+ changes</tt> limit may be lifted in the future, once a more performant changes measurement functionality has been introduced.
