Piggyback data is currently only read when the host has a Check_MK service.
For some systems, the existance of the Check_MK service solely depends on the
existance of piggyback files for the given host.
During the config generation phase of the monitoring core, race conditions could apply,
where a host might receive no Check_MK service.


This werk introduces an explicit piggyback host tag, which allows you to enforce/disable the use of piggyback data.
Per default this option is currently set to <tt>Automatically detect piggyback usage</tt>, to be compatible with the previous
behaviour.


You should explictly set the <tt>Use piggyback data</tt> option if you have a ping only host,
which receives additional piggyback data from another host. This actively prevents beforementioned race conditions.
