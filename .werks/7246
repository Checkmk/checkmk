Hosts using snmp as well as tcp checks may run into a scenario where discovered snmp checks share the same service description as the tcp based checks.
One example is the service description <tt>Uptime</tt>, which is created by the <tt>snmp_uptime</tt> and <tt>uptime</tt> check.

In case of identical service descriptions, the tcp based check wins and the snmp based check is ignored.
