The ps check regularly creates counter values with dyamic names and save them into the counter state file.
There is a cleanup routine which removes outdated counters.

This cleanup routine failed at cleaning up counter values from the deprecated ps.perf check.
As a result the check counters file did steadily grow. This has been fixed. The cleanup now also
checks for outdated ps.perf counters.
