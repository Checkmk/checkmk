The <tt>Check_MK Discovery</tt> check for a cluster was able to identify new/vanished services.
However, the automatic discovery mechanism in the background failed to integrate them into the configuration.


This has been fixed. There is still some constraint which makes this werk incompatible.
The <tt>Periodic service discovery</tt> rule allows you to configure <tt>Automatcally activate changes</tt> for the specified host.
If you want automatic activation of new services for cluster hosts, you have to configured a rule on the nodes instead of the cluster hosts.
So any <tt>Periodic service discovery</tt> rules of clusters should be duplicated onto the nodes.


This requirement is currently necessary because of the internal configuration.
Clusters never have an explicit configuration file, the actual clusters configuration is compute on demand.
