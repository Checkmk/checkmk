You can navigate to the new visualization through an icon, which is shown in the classical view.
The new visualization enables you to view aggregations in a different perspective.

A more elaborate documentation will be provided later on. Some first notes.

You can create layout templates for a group of aggregations. These templates can be assigned in the aggregation configuration.
You can also specifically assign a layout to one aggregation.
