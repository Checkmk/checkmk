Title: BI aggregations: Introduced aggregation ID

Component: bi

Class: feature

In previous versions aggregation templates were identified by the pack name and an automatic index number.
The index number however did not work well when multiple users modify aggregations at the same time.
In a worst case scenario, the wrong aggregation was edited/deleted.

This werk introduces a mandatory id for each aggregation.
Upon saving, old configurations automatically get an ID assigned.
