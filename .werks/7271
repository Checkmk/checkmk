Monitoring systems with multiple thousand folders had performance problems loading the configuration on the command line.
This included operations like service discovery, core config generation or simple commands like <tt>cmk -l</tt>.
On large setups (10k+ Folders) an operation might now finish in 20 instead of 120 seconds.
