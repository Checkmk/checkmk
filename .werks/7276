Title: check_smtp: WATO GUI was unable to display integer based reponse time
Level: 1
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0
Date: 1568819488
Class: fix

Earlier versions stored the response time levels as integer value. Later versions required a float value.
The result was a warning box in the edit rule page, stating that the default settings would be used again.
