Due to an incorrect old configuration conversion routine the snmp datasource setting for a host was incorrectly set/reset to <tt>No SNMP<tt>.
This could be observed on the edit host page, for example. It only applied to hosts where the agent tag group was explicitly set.

This incorrectly transformed snmp setting was written back to disk, when the host itself was saved or when there were any changes made in the host tags configuration.
Changes in the host tag configuration had a greater impact because they forced a complete rewrite of all host configurations.
