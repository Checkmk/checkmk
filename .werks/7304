Solaris uptime check was not working correctly since not all versions of
Solaris and within global and local zones return consistent information.

This fix reverts Werk 4623, which fixed the problem for some setups but
broke it for others.

Currently Solaris agent will deliver more system information about
uptime. The check performs a cross validation of data, if values are
consistent uptime is returned. For inconsistent values, check goes into
UNKNOWN state and user is required to fix/patch their Solaris
system. Additional information of conflicting data is given to the user.

An agent update is needed.
