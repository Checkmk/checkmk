Title: check_bi_aggr: Improve GUI application error handling
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1553167995
Class: fix

When the webservice detects an error -- such as an authentication problem -- it
does not output the expected data structure, but a string starting with
"ERROR:". This is now correctly being detected and the error is output as check
output, rather than a nasty parsing exception.
