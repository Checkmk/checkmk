As written in the documentation
(https://mathias-kettner.com/cms_wato_hosts.html) Check_MK is keeping an
internal DNS cache for the hosts that have configured no static IP address in
Check_MK:

---

With the host name method Check_MK uses cached data in order to minimise
repeated DNS requests during an Activate Changes â€“ which is very important for
accelerating the activation procedure. Furthermore, the cache ensures that a
changed configuration can still be activated if the DNS stops working.

The catch is that Check_MK doesn't automatically notice the change to an
address in DNS. For this reason, in the host details there is the button which
deletes the entire DNS cache and forces a new resolution at the next Activate
changes. This file is found under ~/var/check_mk/ipaddresses.cache in your
instance, by the way. Deleting this file has the same effect as the button as
described above.

---

The problem was that previous versions did not really delete the entire cache,
but only updated it. We have now changed this to make the cache invalidation
work as intended.
