Title: Deprecate inventory_services ruleset
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre

Class: fix

If you have always used WATO to configure your Check_MK you are not affected
by this change.

There have been two rulesets for configuring windows service discovery rules
for a long time. The old one, <tt>inventory_services</tt>, and the newer WATO compatible
ruleset <tt>inventory_services_rules</tt>. The second one has replaced inventory_services_rules
in version 1.2.2 of Check_MK. The old ruleset was still working for compatibility
but has been removed now.

If you have configured such rules in your configuration, it will still load,
but print out a warning message like this: "WARNING: Found rules for deprecated
ruleset 'inventory_services'. These rules are not applied anymore. In case you
still need them, you need to migrate them by hand. Otherwise you can remove
them from your configuration."
