If you have always used WATO to configure your Check_MK you are not affected
by this change.

There have been two rulesets for configuring process discovery rules for a long
time. The old one, <tt>inventory_processes</tt>, and the newer WATO compatible
ruleset <tt>inventory_processes_rules</tt>. The second one has replaced
inventory_processes a long time ago. The old ruleset was still working for
compatibility but has been removed now.

If you have configured such rules in your configuration, it will still load,
but print out a warning message like this: "WARNING: Found rules for deprecated
ruleset 'inventory_processes'. These rules are not applied anymore. In case you
still need them, you need to migrate them by hand. Otherwise you can remove
them from your configuration."

The same applies to the ruleset <tt>inv_domino_tasks</tt> and
<tt>inv_domino_tasks_rules</tt>.
