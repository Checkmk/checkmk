Title: Deprecate logwatch_patterns configuration option

If you have always used WATO to configure your Check_MK you are not affected
by this change.

There have been two configuration options for configuring logwatch pattern on
Check_MK server side rules for a long time. The old one,
<tt>logwatch_patterns</tt>, and the newer WATO compatible ruleset
<tt>logwatch_rules</tt>. The second one has replaced the first one a long time
ago. The old config optionswas still working for compatibility but has been
removed now.

If you have configured such rules in your configuration, it will still load,
but print out a warning message like this: "WARNING: Found rules for deprecated
ruleset 'logwatch_patterns'. These rules are not applied anymore. In case you
still need them, you need to migrate them by hand. Otherwise you can remove
them from your configuration."
