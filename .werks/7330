When switching to the site user context we now enforce a non localized
environment. The reason for this configuration is that the parameters and
outputs of the monitoring plug-ins are localized. If they are called from the
core, they are always language-neutral. During manual testing, the plugins may
behave differently depending on the localization of the user's environment
variables. This can lead to confusion during tests.
