In the rule-based configuration of Check_MK ("Host & Service Parameters" and
"Manual Checks") it often happens that rules with the same conditions have to
be created in different rule chains. With a larger number of rules, this
quickly becomes confusing.

To improve this situation we have now added a feature called "Predefined
conditions". The idea is to preconfigure conditions in a central place, to
which you can later refer in the individual rule chains. A predefined condition
currently always consists of a full set of conditions (folder, tags, host
specification, service specification). A rule can either use explicit
conditions, as before, or refer to a predefined condition now.

You access the predefined conditions via a context button from the pages on
which you manage your rule chains.
