A new HW/SW inventory script has been added that works on a generic "&lt;&lt;&lt;labels&gt;&gt;&gt;" section.
It is used to discover host labels from this section.

The first agent that produces this section is the Kubernetes special agent. It creates the
label sections for all kind of objects that are monitored by Check_MK. This makes Check_MK
automatically import the labels configured in Kubernetes. You can now use them to filter
your views, dashboards and in the future also create rules in WATO based on them.
