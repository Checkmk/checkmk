Title: Add option to show long output in availability timeline
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.6.0b1

Class: feature

In addition to the "last known plugin output" it is now possible to show the
"last known long output" in the availability timeline as separate column.

This column is only populated for hosts / services that have been configured to
write their long output to the monitoring history. This can be done using the
new rulesets "Write long output of services to monitoring history" and "Write
long output of hosts to monitoring history".

Be aware: Enabling this option may increase the filesystem space consumption of
your monitoring history depending on the amount of data your hosts or services
put in the long output. You should only enable this for the objects you need it
for.

This feature can only be used with the Microcore.
