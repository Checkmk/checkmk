We'll release a Grafana datasource for Check_MK shortly. To be able to use the
datasource with the current stable version of Check_MK we backport the API
calls that are needed for this datasource with this werk.

If you are curious, you can have a look at the code of the datasource:
https://github.com/Checkmk/grafana-checkmk-datasource

You could even setup the datasource with a daily build or starting with 1.5.0p16
from now.

We are heading to make this plugin directly available via grafana.com as official
plugin in the next couple of days.
