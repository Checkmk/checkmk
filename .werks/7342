Class: fix

The long time deprecated configuration variable <tt>legacy_checks</tt> has been
removed now. It was replaced by the <tt>custom_checks</tt> option which is working
a bit different.

In case you configured Check_MK only via WATO you will not be affected by this issue,
since legacy_checks could only be configured directly in the configuration files.

In case you need to migrate your configuration, you could move the configuration to
the WATO ruleset "Classical Active and Passive Monitoring Checks". If you need to
migrate the configuration by hand have a look at the CMC migration documentation
(https://mathias-kettner.com/cms_cmc_migration.html#legacy_checks) which describes
the steps.
