The Checkmk configuration variable <tt>checks</tt> was removed

It was used in hand configured Checkmk configurations in the early days. This
variable was never configurable by WATO.  In case you configured Check_MK only
via WATO you will not be affected by this issue.

In case you need to migrate your configuration, you could move the
configuration to the WATO ruleset "Classical Active and Passive Monitoring
Checks".
