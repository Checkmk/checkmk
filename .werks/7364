Title: check_mk_agent.{aix,solaris}: Fixed possibly disappeared inventory entries

Class: fix

On Linux hosts the HW/SW inventory plugin {{mk_inventory}} remembers the
remote address, ie. the Check_MK server, in order to know which server has
already got the inventory data (for caching reasons).
The AIX and Solaris agent does not provide the remote host information.
This may lead to disappearing inventory data on Check_MK servers if at
least two Check_MK servers request data from the same client host.
