Class: feature

Previously the Linux agent delievered the output of 'ip link' which is a subset
of 'ip address'. Now the agent uses 'ip address'.  The inventory plugin
{{mk_inventory}} also executed 'ip address'.  This has been removed from the
agent plugin {{mk_inventory}}. The related inventory plugin 'lnx_if_a' has also
been removed. Instead the inventory plugin 'lnx_if' processes the IP addresses.

In order to use this feature you have to deploy the Linux agent and
{{mk_inventory}} agent plugin.
