Title: apache_status: Ignore certificates from local hosts
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b1
Date: 1554122535
Class: fix

Previously not all cases of failing certificate verfication for
local hosts were handled correctly, which could lead to missing
data for that host.
Instead of handling all cases of invalid certificates we now 
omit certificate verification for local addresses entirely.
Note that this will fail for python versions before 2.7.

This only applies if one of the addresses "127.0.0.1", "[::1]", and
"localhost" is queried using https.
