Title: check_http: Enable SSL/TLS hostname extension support by default

Class: fix

Previously users had to {enable SSL/TLS hostname extension support} (SNI)
explicitly. Omiting the option could result in unexpectedly checking
different content/certificates than the {host address} option would suggest.
We now assume users want SNI support. Users that relied on the previous
behaviour of disabled SNI can disable SNI explicitly useing the option
{Advanced: Disable SSL/TLS hostname extension support (SNI)}.
