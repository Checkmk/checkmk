This check uses the datasource program "Check state of elasticsearch". The
document count and size growth per minute will be recorded and averaged for a
set amount of time (30 minutes by default). The last recent document count
growth and size growth will be compared to this average value.  You can set
thresholds on how much higher the last recent growth can be compared to the
average growth.
