This werk introduces multiple extensions for the Kubernetes special
agent, new checks and inventory plugins:

- The special agent now provides piggyback data for Pods, Deployments and Services.
- The piggyback output is optional and can be configured via the rule for the special agent.
- The special agent now outputs the Kubernetes labels for piggyback hosts. They are shown
  in the HW/SW invenotry and on the host detail page of the hosts. You can add the labels to
  other views and use the labels to filter your views. The labels will be used in more
  upcoming features in the future.

- The new summary check k8s_pod_container for the Pods of a container is added.
- The new inventory plugin k8s_pod_info shows Pod information in the HW/SW inventory.
- The new check k8s_replicas monitors the replica sets of Deployments.
- The new inventory plugin k8s_service_info shows information about Kubernetes Services.
- The new inventory plugin k8s_selector shows the selectors of Kubernetes Services.
- The new check k8s_service_port monitors the Ports defined for Kubernetes Services.
