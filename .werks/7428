Since version 1.5.0p14 the subject and addresses of HTML emails
were escaped, i.e. the characters '&lt;', '&gt;' and '&amp;'
were replaced by '&amp;lt;', '&amp;gt;' and '&amp;amp;',
if present. This resulted in a slightly more unreadable subject
if any of these characters were present and if an email address
contained an ampersand it would result in an invalid (escaped)
email address.
