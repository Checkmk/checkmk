Out of single metrics it is now possible to calculation a forecast for the
future behavior of this metric.

Forecast Graphs in Checkmk implements its time series prediction using
Facebook's Prophet tool. This external tool is not packaged inside Checkmk
and needs to be installed separately. The following instructions assist on
the installation processes and strip unnecessary dependencies. Do the
installation on the sites you want to calculate and visualize the forecast.
Slave sites which only do monitoring don't need the package.

To install the dependencies run the script in
{{bin/install_fbprophet}}. This script has additional flags {{-u}} if you
want to uninstall the dependencies and {{-h}} for a help summary.

The install script is available since version 1.6.0p7, earlier versions of
Chechmk 1.6 do support Forecast Graph but to install dependencies you would
need to download the install script from our online code repository.

The easiest way to use a metric data for Forecast is from the service view
under "Service Metrics" to click in the graph icon and select "Use this
metric for a forecast graph".
