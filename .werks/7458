Class: fix

There are four Cisco CPU checks: cisco_cpu, cisco_cpu_multiitem, cisco_nexus_cpu, cisco_oldcpu.
We discover the Cisco CPU utilization services in the following order:

- if it's a Nexus device the cisco_nexus_cpu check is used

- if the device contains the SNMP table .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.8.* then
  cisco_cpu_multiitem is used

- if the device has the OID .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.5.1 then cisco_cpu is used

- if .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.1.57.0 exists then cisco_oldcpu is used

After firmware updates there may be deprecated OIDs like
.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.1.57.0 or .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.5.1.
In such cases you have to re-discover the related hosts.

There also may Cisco hosts which have discovered the 'wrong' check type.
After a re-discovery the CPU check type may change.
