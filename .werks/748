In that past only builtin views had permissions that you could disable in a
role and that way remove those views for certain users. Now this also works
for custom views - i.e. views that a user has created with a new unique name
and and that is published for other users.

Please note that regardless of a view's permission the owner of the view can
always see it. If you do not like this you can remove the permission for
creating custom views.
