Title: mk_logwatch: Default limit for transmitted data

Class: feature

The linux version of mk_logwatch now limits the amount of data that is being sent.

Up to now it was possible to limit the number of processed bytes/lines.
Now you can also configure the maximum number of bytes that is sent to the monitoring
site. By default, the limit is set to the maximum size of the file storing the log
lines on the server side, which is 500 KB.
The remaining data that has been computed is discarded.

This behaviour can be configured by setting the option 'maxoutputsize'
(see <a href='https://checkmk.de/checkmk_logfiles.html'>here</a>).
