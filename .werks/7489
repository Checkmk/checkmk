For regular expressions in a logwatch section leading or trailing '.*' portions can be
a performance desaster. With long log lines, it can virtually render your system paralyzed.
If you are not using any rewrite patterns though, you can omit leading and trailing '.*'
expressions without changing the set of matched lines.

mk_logwatch now detects those cases, and will optimize the patterns accordingly.
