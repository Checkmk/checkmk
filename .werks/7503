Default redirects from /[site] and /[site]/ to /[site]/omd/ are
are now preserving the original requested protocol (http/https).
When using the apache shared mode (which is the default), having
the system apache service the pages via HTTPS, you will need to
configure the system apache to provide the X-Forwarded-Proto
request header to the site apache, which can be done by
adding the line 'RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"' to
the proxy configuration related to the site.

So if you want to secure your site using SSL, you will need
to configure the following things in the system apache:

a) Enable and configure HTTPS
b) Redirecting all HTTP requests to HTTPS
c) Set the request headers X-Forwarded-Proto, e.g.

```
<Location /[sitename]>
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
</Location>
```
