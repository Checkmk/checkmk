Whenever a server component of Check_MK opens a SSL connection it uses the trusted certificate
authorities to verify the SSL certificate of the destination server. This is used for example
when performing WATO replication to slave sites or when special agents are communicating via
HTTPS.

In older Check_MK versions the system wide trusted CAs were used to do the verification. During
development of Check_MK 1.4 different parts of Check_MK that establish communications via HTTPS
have been refactored to use a new library (python requests) which does not care about the system
wide trusted CAs by default. This lead to SSL verification errors because former verifyable
certificates were now not verifyable anymore. The error messages were different in this situation,
one example is: "SSLError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed".

The first change is that we have now fixed that to get the old functionality back. Check_MK is
now searching <tt>/etc/ssl/certs</tt> or <tt>/etc/pki/tls/certs</tt> for system wide trusted
CAs by default.

The second change is that we have now added a new global setting which you can use to change
the behaviour: <i>Site Management &gt; Trusted certificate authorities for SSL</i>. You can
disable trusting system wide trusted CAs and upload your custom CAs if you need it.
