Now automatic upgrade procedure in Windows Agent 1.6.0 correctly upgrades 
legacy Windows Agents 1.5.0 configuration even if update plugin 1.5.0 installed.

The routine skips incompatible files from 1.5.0, i.e. cmk-agent-update.exe. 
Additionally the upgrade routine doesn't override already existing files.
