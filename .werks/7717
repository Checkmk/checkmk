Version: 1.6.0b4

Class: feature

Summary of the features introduced in Windows Agent beta 4:

- Asynchronous plugins with 'cache_age' set to 0 are supported now.
In previous version such plugins have been assumed as synchronous.

- The Uninstallation of the Windows Agent doesn't remove 'config' and 'state' directories from the Agent Data directory to prevent user data loss.

- The start of the Windows Agent may be delayed by a few seconds to allow asynchronous plugins to finish their work.
This feature has no effect for normal situation when agent is running as a service, but may be useful to test asyncronous plugins.

- Now the Agent uses next directories:
The Windows Agent installs own binary files in the directory "Program Files (x86)\checkmk\service"
For user and bakery data the Windows Agent uses the directory "ProgramData\checkmk\agent"

- The  macroses used in the configuration files had been renamed
$BUILTIN_AGENT_PATH$   -> is C:/Program Files(x86)/checkmk/service/
$BUILTIN_PLUGINS_PATH$ -> is C:/Program Files(x86)/checkmk/service/plugins
$CUSTOM_AGENT_PATH$    -> is C:/ProgramData/checkmk/agent/
$CUSTOM_PLUGINS_PATH$  -> is C:/ProgramData/checkmk/agent/plugins
$CUSTOM_LOCAL_PATH$    -> is C:/ProgramData/checkmk/agent/local

- The logfile check_mk.log have been moved to the "ProgramData/checkmk/agent/log" directory

- The configuration files check_mk.user.yml and check_mk.yml had been revised, cleaned of old and unused data and better documented.

- The default timeout for all plugins is set to 60 seconds, previously the timeout was set to 30.

- Now all names in any yml configuration file with the leading underscore are considered invalid and skipped 
from the output when the command showconfig is used.
