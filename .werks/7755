Special agent to monitor job and build states of a jenkins instance. Beside
the state of the job it gives informations about the job score and the time
since the last successful build. It also outputs informations about the last
build, like the time the build was triggered, the build id, duration and
result.

For performance reasons, the number of recognized jobs is limited to three
nested folder levels.
