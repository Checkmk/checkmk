Class: fix

The Web API calls <tt>get_ruleset</tt> and <tt>set_ruleset</tt>, that were
added with #4699 in Checkmk 1.5 have been changed in an incompatible way.
If you use these API calls in your scripts, you will have to change these
script to be compatible with Checkmk 1.6 and newer.

The change was caused by the change of the internal rule data structure, which
is described in detail in #7352.

The API calls now work with the internal rule format with the difference that
the <tt>host_folder</tt> condition is removed from the rules returned by
<tt>get_ruleset</tt> and automatically added to the rules that are written with
<tt>set_ruleset</tt>.
