The werk #7344 introduced compatibility issues with Linux setups that don't
support linux capabilities (for different reasons). One reason may be a kernel
that does not support the capabilities.

We have added a fallback to the Checkmk debian packages that tries to use the
linux capabilities (as described in #7344). Once that fails it falls back to
setting the SETUID bit on the binaries, just like Checkmk did it before.
