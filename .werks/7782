Title: hp_proliant_da_phydrv, hp_proliant_mem: Fixed crashes caused by different but partial similar SNMP info
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix

Both plugins have a check and a related inventory plugin.
The check plugin processes a subset of the SNMP data of the
inventory plugin.
During some refactorings the fetched OIDs were adapted.
This caused crashes during checking and inventory phase.
