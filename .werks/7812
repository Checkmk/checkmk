It's now possible to configure a list of alternative matching tag IDs of a
single tag group in one rule. The selected tag IDs are ORed.  This reduces some
situations where users had to configure multiple rules when a rule should
affect multiple choices of a tag group.

The inverse operation "match all excluding the configured tag IDs" is also possible.

In this step the tag condition input has been changed to be more
compact by default. This should improve the condition dialog usability,
especially for users with a larger number of tag groups.
