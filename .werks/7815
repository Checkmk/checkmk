Title: Fix URL redirect from /[site]/ to /[site]/check_mk/ in SSL setups

Class: fix

When an user accesses the URL <tt>/[SITE]/</tt>, the user is forwarded to the
Checkmk GUI, which is available via <tt>/[SITE]/check_mk/</tt>. In a HTTPs
setup the redirect could forward the user to a HTTP URL instead of HTTPS in
some cases.
