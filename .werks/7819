The HTTP header authentication can be enabled in the Global Settings using the
option "Authenticate users by incoming HTTP requests". In case you do not use
this authentication method, you are not affected by this issue.

It is mostly used in some reverse proxy setups where the Checkmk apache is
located behind an authentication service. The authentication service only tells
Checkmk the authenticated username and the user interfaces allows the user to
enter without further authentication.

The user name is handed over as HTTP header with each HTTP request to the site
apache and forwarded to the GUI.

With Checkmk 1.5 or older in connection with apache 2.4 and Checkmk 1.6 with
all apache versions this feature can not be used anymore using HTTP header
variables containing other characters than <tt>A-z, a-z, 0-9 and -</tt>. For
example <tt>X-Remote-User</tt> is still working, while <tt>REMOTE_USER</tt>
(which uses the not allowed <tt>_</tt>) is not working anymore.

This 1.6.0b3 release fixes an issue in this header variable processing and
changes the default setting in the GUI to <tt>X-Remote-User</tt>.

If you configured this before with 1.5, you will have to check your
configuration and change the HTTP header variable in the reverse proxy and
Checkmk configuration to make it work with the new variable syntax.
