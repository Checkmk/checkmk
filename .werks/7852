Title: df: Filesystems of type devtmpfs are now ignored completely
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
State: unknown
Version: 1.6.0b4

Previously only the mountpoint /dev has been ignored explicitly by the check
plugin. Now all mountpoints are ignored, that has the type devtmpfs. There
is no reason to monitor these types anyway.

Previously discovered filesystems like /dev/tty need to removed manually
after the agent has been updated.
