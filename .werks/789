Title: oracle_tablespaces: fixed bug when using dynamic filesystem levels
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i2p1

Class: fix

The check did not process the dynamic levels correctly.
If there was a rule with dynamic filesystem levels, e.g.
<ul>
<li>1 TB - 5%/2% free</li>
<li>500 GB - 6%/3% free</li>
<li>200 GB - 10%/4% free</li>
<li>500 MB - 20%/15% free</li>
</ul>
and the filesystems size was 700GB, the levels of the 500 MB rule were actually used.
