GUI metric plugins which were built for Checkmk 1.5 or older could
access the variable MAX_CORES and the function indexed_color(). This
was not possible in previous 1.6 releases which made these plugins
incompatible.

Both names are available again for plugins in the path <tt>local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/metrics/</tt>.
