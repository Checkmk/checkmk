Title: Fixed query/idle timeouts.

Class: fix

The CMC has two builtin hardwired timeouts regardin Livestatus: If a client
connects and doesn't send anything for 5 minutes, the CMC closes the
connection (idle timeout).  If a client doesn't finish sending a complete
query within 10 seconds, the CMC closes the connection, too (query timeout).

The lengths of those timeouts have been swapped since 1.5.0i1, which has
been fixed now.  Note that the Nagios core was not affected by this
regression, the NEB handled the timeouts correctly.
