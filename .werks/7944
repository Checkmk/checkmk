Title: Fixed handling of unfresh services
Level: 2
Component: cmc
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 2.0.0i1

Class: fix

The 1.6.0 branch introduced a regression: When a service was detected as
unfresh, the CMC terminated with a log message of the form:

   host name mismatch in active check result: expected 'FOO', got 'BAR'

Even worse, this state was permanent: After restarting the same thing
happened again, so the only way to get out of this was to remove the CMC's
state file. Note that this only affected unfresh services, not hosts.

The problem was caused by an internal confusion of host name and service
name of the unfresh service, which has been fixed.
