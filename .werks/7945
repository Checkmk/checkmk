Title: veeam_tapejobs: treat idle background jobs like working ones
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: fix

Previously idle backgroud jobs went to a {CRIT} state right away.
They are now treated in the same manner as working backgroud jobs,
going to {WARN} or {CRIT} when the corresponding configured (or default)
levels are exceeded.
