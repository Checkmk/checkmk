If a new logfile is found we usually skip to its end to avoid processing ancient log messages.
You can now configure mk_logwatch to start processing the file from the beginning and see all
messages that may already be present.

To enable this behaviour, either set the corresponding flag in the agent bakery rule, or add
'fromstart=True' to your configuration file.
