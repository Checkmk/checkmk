Title: mk_logwatch: process new files from the beginning
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b4
Date: 1562570170
Class: feature

If a new logfile is found we usually skip to its end to avoid processing ancient log messages.
You can now configure mk_logwatch to start processing the file from the beginning and see all
messages that may already be present.

To enable this behaviour, either set the corresponding flag in the agent bakery rule, or add
'fromstart=True' to your configuration file.
