Title: docker_container_status: Improved discovery and health check
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: feature

The docker container status check now only discovers containers that either should be
running (restart policy set to 'always') or actually are running.

For the subset of those that have a health check set up, the service 'Docker container health' is discoverd.
It now also reports the last reported health test output and the health test command.
