Title: agent_vsphere: Collect performance counters from vCenter
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b4

Class: feature

Previously some counters could only be fetched from the ESX host directly.
We now provide the counters when connecting to the vCenter as well.

If the special agent is executed against the vCenter and creating services
on the ESX hosts via the piggyback mechanism, this may add the "Disk IO",
"Datastore IO" and "Interface" services to the affected hosts.
