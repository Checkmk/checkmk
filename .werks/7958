Class: feature

The checkmk agent for Linux hosts now also sends the <i>cgroup</i>
information proveded by the ps command. This allows users to filter
processes by their control group during discovery.

For instance you can use this to exclude processes running in Docker
containers.

See the help of the discovery rule "Discover Processes" for details.
