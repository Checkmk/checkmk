Title: Add all custom variables of host, service and contact to notification
Level: 2
Edition: cee
Component: cmc
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1391091862
Class: feature

The CMC now automatically adds all custom variables of hosts, service and
contacts to the notification context. The variable name is prefixed with
the word <tt>HOST</tt>, <tt>SERVICE</tt> or `CUSTOM` and - as its
variable name custom - converted to upper case. So a host variable with
the name `_foobar` will be available as `HOST_FOOBAR` in the
notification context. The names will be prefixed with `NOTIFY_` and put
into the environment of the notification plugin. So at the end the variable
will be available as `NOTIFY_HOST_FOOBAR`, e.g. in a shell script:

`mynotify.sh`
```
echo "Foobar: $NOTIFY_HOST_FOOBAR"
```

H2:Notes


* In the configuration files in <tt>main.mk</tt> or below <tt>conf.d</tt>
  the variables can be set via `extra_host_conf` or `extra_service_conf`.
  You need to have the variable names begin with an underscore. So a variable name of <tt>foobar</tt>
  is not allowed. You have to write either `_foobar` or `_FOOBAR`.
* When you add contact custom variables via WATO (button <i>Custom Attributes</i>
  in the users management) the underscore will <i>automatically</i> be added.
* when using Nagios as monitoring core you have to adapt `check_mk_templates.cfg`
  whenever you add a new custom variable.
