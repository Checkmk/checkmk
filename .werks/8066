Title: Fix problem where manual cmk -O or cmk -R would not activate changes for CMC

If you create a new host in WATO, then go to the command line, do a <tt>cmk -I</tt>
and then <tt>cmk -O</tt> or <tt>cmk -R</tt> then your changes would not be activated.
This is due the CMC Rushead Daemon. It had created a valid configuration after the
last WATO operation. Check_MK used that configuration on the next reload. Now a
<tt>cmk -O</tt> or <tt>cmk -R</tt> on the command line assumes that you have done
changes on the command line and ignores the configuration of the Rushahead daemon.

Note: There is still the problem that a change on the command line cannot be
activate with WATO. This will not be fixed. If you do something on the command line
then please activate it on the command line.
