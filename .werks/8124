Title: Avoid configuration changes to be become active without activate changes

The Check_MK keepalive mode, which is used for the Check_MK helpers and for the
RRD creation helper, now uses a new method for reading the configuration from
<tt>main.mk</tt>, the other <tt>*.mk</tt> files and the <tt>autochecks</tt>. This
new method has two advantages:

<ul>
<li>Changes done to <tt>*.mk</tt> files can no longer become active unless they
are activated. This even holds for core or server restarts and for crashed check
helpers</li>
<li>Check helpers and RRD helper do not any longer need to restart themselves
after a configuration change but simply reload the changed configuration. This
has a muss smaller CPU footprint when activating changes.</li>
<li>Autochecks files are now only read for the host that is currently being
delt with. This makes the internal check table much smaller and speeds
configuration reloads.</li>
</ul>

The gross result is that configuration changes are now really automic and
also faster.

H2:Implementation details

Whenever you create the configuration for the core (options <tt>-B</tt>, <tt>-O</tt>,
<tt>-R</tt> or <tt>-U</tt> or <i>Activate Changes</i> via WATO) then the complete
configuration (the result from parsing <tt>main.mk</tt> and friends) is written to
the file <tt>var/check_mk/core/config.mk</tt>. The core then triggers the check
helpers for configuration reload. The helpers simply re-read that file and are
immediately up-to-date. At the same time copies (hard links) of the autochecks
files in <tt>var/check_mk/autochecks</tt> are being created in <tt>var/check_mk/core/autochecks</tt>.
These files are used during the monitoring.

Note: The <i>Discovery</i> check (formerly known as <i>Inventory</i> check) does <i>not</i>
use the activated configuration but still that one that is modified via WATO. That way
after doing a service discovery the discovery check will immediately be happy - without
a core restart. This is just as it used to be.
