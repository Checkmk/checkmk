In a distributed setup a slave site may try to deliver
notifications locally during an activate changes even
though the slave site should forward notifications to
the master site.

This effect appears when the option "Notification Spooling"
is set to "Asynchronous local delivery by notification
spooler" in the global settings and to "Forward to
remote site by notification spooler" in the "Site specific
global settings" of the slave site.

This werk fixes this issue by locking the Checkmk
configuration when a configuration snapshot is installed
on the remote site. This way the "cmk --notify"
command and the mknotifyd cannot use a partially installed
Checkmk configuration.

As a workaround the "Notification Spooling" can be set to
"Forward to remote site by notification spooler" in the
global settings and to "Asynchronous local delivery by
Notification spooler" in the "Site specific global settings"
of the slave site.
