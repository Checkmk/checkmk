Title: notifications crash if non ASCII characters are present in the plugin output
Level: 1
Component: notifications

Class: fix

For bulk notifications this results in recurring notifications since
the corresponding spoolfile was not cleaned up. Non bulk notifications
were not sent multiple times. For both normal and bulk notifications
no "Final notification result" was produced in the "Host- and Service
notifications" view.
