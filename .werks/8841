The discovered host labels which were introduced during the first beta
versions of Checkmk 1.6 had to be reworked for some reasons. The new
implementation is now based on the Service discovery mechanism, which
makes several things a lot easier for us.

Host labels are now discovered during the procedure of Checkmk service
discovery. All discovery functions of the checks are able to either
discover services and host labels.

<ul>
<li>The "Check_MK Discovery" service tells you about new found host labels,
just like about services.</li>
<li>You can use the "Service discovery" page of WATO to view the discovered
host labels. New discovered host labels now trigger a warning state by default.
This state can be configured using the "Periodic service discovery" ruleset.
<li>The automatic activation function, that can be configured in the "Periodic
service discovery" ruleset may be used to automatically add new host labels on
a regular base.</li>
<li>Whenever you execute a service discovery (via command line, GUI or API),
the host labels will also be discovered.</li>
<li>CEE: The DCD can immediately add host labels when you have enabled the
service discovery for a DCD connection.</li>
</ul>

Check programmers: You may add something like this to your discovery
functions for creating host labels:

C+:
    yield HostLabels(
        HostLabel(u"os", u"Windows"),
        HostLabel(u"type", u"security"),
    )
C-:

This adds two host labels os:Windows and type:security to the host.
