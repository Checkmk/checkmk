In previous 1.6 releases the Web API did not validate the labels that
could e.g. be added to hosts strictly enough. When using "python" as
"request_format" this could result in a broken configuration, leading
to exceptions in several places of the GUI.

The Web API now ensures the received labes are all unicode strings as
Checkmk expects.
