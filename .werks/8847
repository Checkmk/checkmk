Title: Service discovery: Print warning instead of failing on discovery errors

Class: fix

The service discovery page of WATO was terminating the service discovery on the
first error, independent of which discovery function raised the error. In this
situation a single broken check could break the service discovery functionality
of WATO.

On the command line (cmk -I) the default behavious is to proceed with the other
discovery function when a single discovery function fails. This is now the
default behavior of the WATO discovery page.
