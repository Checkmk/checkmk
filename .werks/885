Title: New option for writing all messages into a syslog-like logfile
Level: 1
Component: ec
Version: 1.2.5i3
Date: 1397482457
Class: feature

The new Event Console global option <i>Syslog-like message logging</i> will enable
logging of <b>all</b> incoming events into logfiles that have syslog format.
These files will be stored below <tt>var/check_mk/mkeventd/messages</tt> and will
be named with the same scheme as the history logfiles. They will adopt the same
rotation principle as the history files.

If you are using Check_MK in a non-OMD environment and enable this option then
please make sure that you have some logrotate configuration or similar for
deleting outdated files.

If you are using OMD then consider enabling the global <i>Diskspace Cleanup</i>.
