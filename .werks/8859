Title: omd: Improved output of hook scripts (e.g. during update)
Level: 1
Component: omd
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
State: unknown
Version: 2.0.0i1
Date: 1565804128

The hook scripts, that can be executed by OMD and are executed during
update by default as of 1.6 are now always printing their stdout/stderr
instead of only in verbose mode. This makes it easier to debug problems
during regular processing.
