Title: Docker: Fix GUI redirects (1.6 regression)
Level: 1
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.6.0b7
Date: 1566312371
Class: fix

When directly using the GUI of the official Checkmk docker container without a reverse proxy
in front of it, the redirects of URLs like <tt>http://[address]/cmk</tt> were not working in
the previous 1.6 releases.

The redirects have now been fixed. In addition we have now added a new redirect from the top
level URL <tt>http://[address]/</tt> which redirects the user to the GUI.
