Title: Fix discovery and activation on temporarily disabled sites

When sites are disabled using the site option "Temporarily disable this connection", this
should only affect the status GUI and not the configuration. In previous versions the
setting also affected the "activate changes" and broke the service discovery for remote
hosts.
