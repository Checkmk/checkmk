The factory settings (which are applied only for new sites) are now creating
a rule in the "Do hardware/software inventory" ruleset which enables the status
data inventory for all docker containers (hosts with label "cmk/docker_object:node").

This simplifies the initial docker monitoring setup.

Users which update existing sites need to create this rule on their own.
