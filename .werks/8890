By default the Agent reloads the configuration files only on the start.

To manually reload all configuration files you can use command line:
check_mk_agent.exe reload_config

To automatically reload configuration files on every connect(the behavior 
from beta 4 and earlier) you can set the environment variable CMA_AUTO_RELOAD 
to yes
