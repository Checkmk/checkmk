Now it is possible to remove the Legacy Agent during or after the Windows Agent 1.6 installation. 

There are three methods:

1. From the command line please, call 'check_mk_agent.exe remove_legacy' to remove the Legacy Agent 
immediately 

2. During GUI-based MSI installation, please set the check box 'Remove Legacy Agent' to remove agent 
immediately after the installation of the Windows Agent

3. To remove the Legacy Agent through user configuration file, please add to the section global 
the line 

  remove_legacy: yes
  
In this case the Legacy Agent will be removed after reload of the configuration file.

Important notes: method 3 removes the Legacy Agent only once. This is done to avoid infinite 
'remove Legacy Agent' after every agent restart and or configuration reload.

Through the method 1 the Legacy Agent may be removed unconditionally at any moment.
