Previously, Windows Agent processed the plugin configuration 
using the approach: the first rule wins. 
Thus, each plugin can only use one rule for its configuration.

From now on, the Windows Agent agent applies all the rules to each plugin, 
provided that the rule file name pattern matches with the plugin name.
