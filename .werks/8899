Previously in check_mk.user.yml, installed from the Windows Agent MSI, 
the parameter 'only_from' was incorrectly initialized with an empty value. 
This effectively prevented the setting of 'only_from' using Bakery, 
because the user configuration is more prioritized than the bakery one.

Now the 'only_from' parameter is removed from check_mk.user.yml.
