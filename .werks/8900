Title: mysql_capacity: Fix problem with warn/crit size
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
State: unknown
Version: 1.6.0b5
Date: 1565007698

The crit and warn levels to mysql capacity check values were wrongly multiplied
by 1024. For example, kB was interpreted as MB. This has been fixed.

<b>Note</b>: Users who have set these levels such that the check works before
this fix must now update the unit. The fix does not change the behavior of the
check for users without crit and warn levels.
