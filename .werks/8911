Title: Fix CRIT criterion for k8s_pod_container

Cleanly terminated containers would erroneously mark the
check CRIT.  Now, the check is only CRIT when a container
exited with a non-zero error code, otherwise it remains OK.
The check now reports more information: the number of
running containers, the number of waiting containers, and
the number of terminated containers.
