Piggybacked hosts get their data from source hosts. The source hosts save the
piggyback data to files. There's also a status file written by the source
in order to know whether the source host has sent piggyback data at all.
There may be several situations such that the piggybacked hosts cannot processed
their data:
<ul>
<li>Piggyback file is too old</li>
<li>Source is not sending piggyback data</li>
<li>Piggyback data file is not updated by source</li>
<li>Piggyback file age cannot be determined</li>
</ul>

Now the 'Check_MK' service of piggybacked hosts show these messages.
