Level: 1
Component: wato
Class: fix

Version: 1.2.5i3
Date: 1402394358

The maximum value for the CPU utilization in the WATO rules "State and count of processes"
and "Process inventory" was set to 101 percent. There were some instances where this value was higher than this limit.
For example if an application used multiple CPUs or the utilization value was calculated for a group of processes.
