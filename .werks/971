Title: Fix missing authentication of PHP addons in D-WATO when activation mode is reload
Level: 1

Class: fix

When you set the activation mode in WATO from <i>restart</i> to <i>reload</i> and use
distributed WATO then on the remote sites the hook for creating the authentication
information for PHP addons like PNP4Nagios and NagVis would not be created. This has
been fixed now.
