Title: Renaming of hosts via WATO
Level: 2
Component: wato
Version: 1.2.5i3
Date: 1400582297
Class: feature

WATO has now a new function <i>Rename Host</i>. You will find a button with that name
in the Properties of a host. It allows a renaming of an existing host. Before you
can use that feature you need to have all changes activated, so nothing is pending.

Renaming a host is a complex precedure that will not only rename the host in WATO,
but also in:

<ul>
<li>all rules from <i>Host &amp; Service Parameters</i></li>
<li>cluster's node definitions</li>
<li>a host's parent definitions</li>
<li>Business Intelligence rules</li>
<li>notification rules (both rule based and flexible notifications)</li>
<li>internal Check_MK data like caches and performance counters</li>
<li>auto-disovered services of the host</li>
<li>logfile information of logwatch plugin</li>
<li>stored SNMP walks</li>
<li>RR databases with performance data</li>
<li>RRD updates in journal of RRD Cache</li>
<li>spool files of PNP4Nagios</li>
<li>NagVis maps</li>
<li>monitoring history entries (events and availability)</li>
<li>the current monitoring state (including ackowledgements and downtimes)</li>
</ul>

Please note that renaming of a host involves a temporary stop of the monitoring
core. This is neccessary in order to avoid situation where the old and the new
name of a host is being used at the same time.
