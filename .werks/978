Title: Fix security issue with mk-job on Linux
Level: 2
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i3

Class: security
Compatible: incomp

By use of symlinks or hardlinks normal users could inject files to be read
with root permissions. This was due to the fact that <tt>/var/lib/check_mk_agent/job</tt>
was installed with the permissions <tt>1777</tt>, just as <tt>/tmp</tt>. That way
a normal user could have placed a symlink to a file there that is only readable
by <tt>root</tt>. The content of that file would then appear in the agent output.

This has been fixed by not longer using <tt>/var/lib/check_mk_agent/job</tt> directly,
but by creating a separate subdirectory below that for each user. This is done by
a new version of <tt>/usr/bin/mk-job</tt>, so please make sure that if you update
the agent that you also update <tt>mk-job</tt>.

Also you now have to create job subdirectories for non-<tt>root</tt> jobs manually.
If you have a job running as user <tt>foo</tt>, then do:

C+:
RP:mkdir -p /var/lib/check_mk_agent/job
RP:chown foo:foo /var/lib/check_mk_agent/job
C-:

If you update the Check_MK Agent with RPMs/DEB from the new agent bakery or by
an RPM/DEB created from the source code with <tt>make rpm</tt> or <tt>make deb</tt>
then the permissions of <tt>/var/lib/check_mk_agent/job</tt> are automatically
fixed.

If you have installed the agent manually then please make sure that the permissions
of the job directory are set properly:

C+:
RP:chmod 755 /var/lib/check_mk_agent/job
C-:
