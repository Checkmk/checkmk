Title: logwatch.ec: Fix forwarding multiple messages via syslog/TCP
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: fix

If you setup forwarding to the Event Console in the {logwatch.ec} check to
be done via TCP and more than one new message per check interval arrived,
then several messages could have be joined together into one single message.
The reason was a missing newline character. This has been fixed. Forwarding
via UDP was not affected by this bug.
