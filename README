Building on your own packages
-----------------------------

It is highly recommended to use Check_MK packages we provide
(http://mathias-kettner.com/download).

But if you really want to build your own packages, you need either download the
source packages from our website or check out the git repository.

To prepare your system for building you need to execute this command:

  make -C omd setup

It will install the missing build dependencies (if you are working on a
supported Linux distribution).

Then you can either create RPM or DEB packages, depending on your distro.
To build an RPM execute this:

  make rpm

To create a DEB package execute this:

  DEBFULLNAME="Mr. Buildmaster" DEBEMAIL="mail@buildmaster.com" make deb

Don't forget to insert your name and mail address. As a result your should
find packages named like this: check-mk-[edition]-[version].[deb|rpm] in
your current directory.
