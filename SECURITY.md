# Vulnerability disclosure policy

We at Checkmk take the **security** of all our products very seriously. To aid those who wish to
help us in **continuously** improving our security, we provide a disclosure policy outlined within
the [vulnerability disclosure policy](https://checkmk.com/vulnerability-disclosure-policy).

If you feel this policy does not answer your questions or provide you with a clear way forward, you
can contact our security team **directly** at [security@checkmk.com](mailto:security@checkmk.com).
