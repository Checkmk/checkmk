# This is an exaple configuration file for the plugin

#     mk_docker.py
#
# It is designed to give you an impression of available
# options. The specific choice in this file is a valid setup,
# but probably not suitable for your use case.
# If you intend to run the plugin with the default options,
# you do not need any configuration file at all.

# You must specify one section of the name DOCKER (additional sections are ignored).
[DOCKER]

# SELECTION OF AGENT SECTIONS (SERVICES) TO CREATE
# If some of the sections take too long to run, and you don't need them, you
# can disable them by specifying a comma separated list (Default: empty string
# - run all sections). To disable the sections <<<docker_node_disk_usage>>>
# and <<<docker_node_images>>>, for example, provide:
skip_sections: docker_node_disk_usage,docker_node_images
# You may skip any of the following sections:
#  * docker_node_disk_usage:     get df like info of disk usage (may take long)
#  * docker_node_images:         get detailed information on all images and containers
#                                (for HW/SW inventory)
#  * docker_node_network:        get network information
# The following sections send piggyback information to monitored containers:
#  * docker_container_node_name: display nodes name on container
#  * docker_container_status:    container status/health according to docker health API
#  * docker_container_labels:    containers labels
#  * docker_container_network:   containers network configuration
#  * docker_container_agent:     retrieve information by running the
#                                check_mk_agent inside the container
# If no agent was installed on the container:
#  * docker_container_mem:       container memory stats
#  * docker_container_cpu:       container cpu utilization
#  * docker_container_diskstat   container disk stats

# CONTAINER ID
# You can choose what to use as the container identifier. This will
# affect the name used for the piggyback host corresponding to the
# container, as well as items for services created on the node for each
# container.
# By default, the identifier is assumed to be the first 12 characters
# of the container UUID. You can choose to use the full ID or the containers
# name instead. Allowed values are "short" (the default), "long" and "name".
container_id: name

# BASE URL
# By default we are trying to connect to the docker API engine
# via the unix socket:
base_url: unix://var/run/docker.sock
