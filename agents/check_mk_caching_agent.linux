#   Checkmk Caching Agent                                           #
#                                                                    #
#   This is a wrapper for the normal check_mk_agent. It optimizes    #
#   situations where - due to fully redundant monitoring - the       #
#   target host is queried by two or even more monitoring servers    #
#   in parallel. It will cache with output of the agent and send     #
#   the contents of the cache file to servers that have not seen     #
#   that output yet. No time criteria is needed, so this is working  #
#   without configuration, regardless of your check interval. It     #
#   is not even neccessary that all servers are polling with the     #
#   same interval.                                                   #
#                                                                    #
#   We apoplogize for the fact that this wrapper is running only     #
#   on Linux, currently and uses features of the BASH (for sake      #
#   of execution speed). An adaption for other Unices should not     #
#   be very difficult.                                               #
#                                                                    #
#   In order to use this wrapper, simply call it instead of          #
#   check_mk_agent. This works via SSH and via xinetd. I'm not       #
#   sure if the normal inetd gives you access to the REMOTE_HOST     #
#   ip address, which is absolutely needed here.                     #
# ------------------------------------------------------------------ #

export MK_CACHEDIR="/var/cache/check_mk"

# Determine the IP address of the remote Nagios server.
# xinetd sends us the IP address of the remote host via
# the environment variable REMOTE_HOST. SSH sets a variable
# SSH_CONNECTION where the remote IP address is the first
# part of a space-separated list. Of both fails, we set
# the address to 'unknown'
