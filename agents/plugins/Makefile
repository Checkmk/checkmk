# "make" rebuild all _2.py files even if they didn't change compared to the
# last time. Since we want to optimize the time of the source package build, we
# introduce this to use the source file hash to decide whether or not to update
# the _2.py files. Not ideal, but works. Let me know if you have something
# better.
