These plugins can be installed in the plugins directory of the Linux agent
in /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/. Please only install the plugins that
you really need.

If you want a plugin to be run asynchronously and also in
a larger interval then the normal check interval, then you can
copy it to a subdirectory named after a number of *minutes*,
e.g.:

/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/60/mk_zypper

In that case the agent will:

 - Run this plugin in the background and wait not for it to finish.
 - Store the result of the plugin in a cache file below /etc/check_mk/cache.
 - Use that file for one hour before running the script again.
