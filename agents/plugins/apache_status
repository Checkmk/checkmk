# Check_MK-Agent-Plugin - Apache Server Status
#
# Fetches the server-status page from detected or configured apache
# processes to gather status information about this apache process.
#
# To make this agent plugin work you have to load the status_module
# into your apache process. It is also needed to enable the "server-status"
# handler below the URL "/server-status".
#
# By default this plugin tries to detect all locally running apache processes
# and to monitor them. If this is not good for your environment you might
# create an apache_status.cfg file in MK_CONFDIR and populate the servers
# list to prevent executing the detection mechanism.
#
# It is also possible to override or extend the ssl_ports variable to make the
# check contact other ports than 443 with HTTPS requests.
