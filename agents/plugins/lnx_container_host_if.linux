    # This section essentially provides the same information as lnx_if, therefore
    # only one of these sections should be used. It is recommended to use lnx_if
    # (default in Checkmk).

    # lnx_if obtains its data from /proc/net/dev, this section obtains it from
    # /sys/class/net.

    # Use case: Kubernetes: The Checkmk agent runs inside a container on the
    # Kubernetes cluster but aims to collect information of the underlying node.
    # The node can be a real server, a VM, or a cloud server instance.
    # /proc/net/dev only shows interfaces of the host namespace (in this case
    # the container). Instead, the files in /sys/class/net are mounted from the
    # node into the container and provide network information of the node in this
    # way. Note that agent sections are sourced and run selectively, the lnx_if
    # section is therefore excluded.

    # HOST_PATH_PREFIX: This environment variable is used to provide a way to
    # mount /sys/class/net to an alternative path. If not set, the default location
    # is the system path (/sys/class/net).
