# Needed to get read CPU usage of processes (and other data) on Linux, since
# ps only outputs the cumulated CPU usage since the process start

# Configuration: /etc/check_mk/psperf.cfg
# Each line contains one pattern for pgrep. Arguments of pgrep are supported
# Example:
# cups
# -u ntp
# This will find processes with the name 'cups' and processes owned by the user ntp.
# The check ps will parse this additional information in order to compute
# the current CPU utilization of a process.
