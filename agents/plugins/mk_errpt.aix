# Logfile monitoring for AIX via errpt
#
# This plugin will send all new lines reported by
# errpt to the monitoring server in the form of a
# logwatch section.
# On the monitoring server side this will appear to
# be a monitored logfile by the name 'errorlog'.
# Every encoutered line will be reported as 'CRIT'
#

## Output of errpt looks like this, newest first
