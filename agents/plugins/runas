# This plugin allows to execute mrpe, local and plugin skripts with a different user context
# It is configured with in the file $MK_CONFDIR/runas.cfg
#
# Syntax:
# [Script type] [User context] [File / Directory]
#
# Example configuration
# # Execute mrpe commands in given files under specific user
# # A '-' means no user context switch
# mrpe ab /home/ab/mrpe_commands.cfg
# mrpe lm /home/lm/mrpe_commands.cfg
# mrpe - /root/mrpe/extra_commands.cfg
#
# Excecute -executable- files in the target directories under specific user context
# plugin ab /var/ab/plugins
# local ab /var/ab/local
#

# SC2162: read without -r will mangle backslashes.
# The following suppression was added when we enabled the corresponding shellcheck.
# It may well be that "read -r" would be more appropriate (for all of the three read commands).
# shellcheck disable=SC2162
