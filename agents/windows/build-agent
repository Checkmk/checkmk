# Build Windows agent with GNU autotools.
#
# Options:
#          -jN  where N is the number of parallel build jobs
#          (for usage, see 'man make'). Default: half of available CPU cores.
# Parameters:
#          Possible make targets. By default, a parallel build and
#          install-strip (non-debug) is done and an msi installer produced.
#
# Requires the environment variable CHROOT_BUILD_DIR to be set.
