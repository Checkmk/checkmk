# User Check MK configuration file
#

# The Agent will accept YML-File as a valid configuration file
# only when the section global is presented

# $CUSTOM_PLUGINS_PATH$  -> is ProgramData/checkmk/agent/plugins
# $BUILTIN_PLUGINS_PATH$ -> is Program Files(x86)/checkmk/service/plugins
# $CUSTOM_AGENT_PATH$    -> is ProgramData/checkmk/agent/
# $CUSTOM_LOCAL_PATH$    -> is ProgramData/checkmk/agent/local

# 1. use http://www.yamllint.com/ for example to validate your yamllint
# 2. Windows filenames contains backslash \, ergo you have to write either "c:\\windows" or 'c:\windows' 

# To disable any feature you may use two methods
# 1. commenting out with '#' recommended to use with one line declarations
# 2. renaming. Recommended to disable big parts of YAML tree
#   Most useful is adding _ at the beginning of name
#
# example 
#         _logging: # <----- this structure is fully ignored by agent
#         logging:  # <----- this structure is accepted by agent

# Overriding values from the bakery( or defauts )
# For example we want to change sections set in output

# 1. All sections are included:
# sections: []  # <--- this is accepted as FULL list of sections, agent sends all data. To save your keystrokes

# 2a. Two sections:
# sections: [check_mk, systemtime]  # <--- this is accepted as list of two sections

# 2b. One section:
# sections: [plugins]  # <--- this is accepted as list of one section

# 3. We want to return back(Use values combined from default and bakery if present)
# 3a. 
# sections: ~   # <--- this line is skipped, this value is estimated as undefined

# 3a. 
# _sections: [plugins]   # <--- this name, '_sections' is unknown and will be ignored too
