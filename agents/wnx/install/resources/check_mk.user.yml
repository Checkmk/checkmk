# 1. use http://www.yamllint.com/ for example to validate your yamllint
# 2. Windows filenames contains backslash \, ergo you have to write either "c:\\windows" or 'c:\windows' 

# To disable any feature you may use two methods
# 1. commenting out with '#' recommended to use with one line declarations
# 2. renaming. Recommended to disable big parts of YAML tree
#   Most useful is adding _ at the beginning of name
