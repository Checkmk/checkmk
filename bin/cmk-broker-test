"""cmk-broker-test

A debugging tool for Checkmks builtin message broker. This tests if sites of a shared distributed setup can communicate via the message broker.
Some debugging information is printed to the console, but you cannot expect this to be a stable interface.

You can start this application in two modes:

When the SITE argument is given, the application will send a message to the given site and wait for a response.
It will exit successfully if the response contains the expected UUID, otherwise it will exit with some error code.

When the SITE argument is omitted, the application will start listening for incoming messages.
It will respond to each message with a message of its own, containing the same UUID.
