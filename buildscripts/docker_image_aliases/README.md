# Provide git-trackable "Docker Image Aliases" 

## Goals

* pull from corporate registry whenever possible
** no Docker:pull operation should use the global Docker hub by default
* allow reproducability of exact images for every branch
** instead of (volatile) global names for images (e.g. `busybox:latest`) their shas should be used
** a git tracable text file contains mapping from aliases to image shas
* avoid redundancy
** updating one alias should be done in exactly one file
* allow parallelization
** alias -> sha mapping must not be part of global docker state
* allow work from outside of corporate network
** using the Docker hub should still be possible

## Usage

### Register a new docker image alias

Just switch to `buildscripts/docker_image_aliases` and run `register.py` providing the name of
the image alias (preferably uppper case and prefixed with "`IMAGE_`" for consistancy).

        $ ./register.py IMAGE_CMK_BASE debian:buster-slim

A directory named after the image alias containing a `Dockerfile` and `meta.yml` gets created.
`git add` and `commit` them in order to make your image alias official.

You can now output the unique ID of a locally stored image by running 
`buildscripts/docker_image_aliases/resolve.py` providing the alias name:

        $ buildscripts/docker_image_aliases/resolve.py IMAGE_CMK_BASE
        df0140a4030c

### Update aliases

In order to update a specific or all aliases to their respective upstreams, run `update.sh`:

        update.sh [IMAGE_CMK_BASE ..]

This script basically validates your input and updates all provided aliases by removing and
re-registering them (which can also be done manually).

After locally updating an image you have to commit/push changes to the respective `Dockerfile`.
In case there are no changes to any `Dockerfile` there had been no new image defined by upstream,
resulting in the exact same image id.


### Use the image alias in Dockerfiles and scripts

Dockerfiles which shall be based on an image alias have to reference it using a build argument:

        ARG IMAGE_CMK_BASE
        # hadolint ignore=DL3006
        FROM ${IMAGE_CMK_BASE}

Note that you can choose a different name for the argument, but for consistancy please use the
same name as for the alias. This way it's easy to get the context.


There is an example Docker image contained in `buildscripts/docker_image_aliases/example`. To build
it manually just run `docker build` as usual and provide the variable containing the actual image id
via `--build-arg`:

        docker build \
            --pull \
            --build-arg "IMAGE_CMK_BASE=$(./resolve.sh IMAGE_CMK_BASE)" \
            -t debian_example example

Whereever you `run` (or somehow reference) an image you would have referenced directly you now run
`resolve.sh` to get the image behind the alias. E.g. in scripts/Makefiles instead of writing 

        docker run --rm -i hadolint/hadolint < Dockerfile

you can now run s.th. like

        docker run --rm -i $$(<PATH_TO>/resolve.sh IMAGE_HADOLINT) < Dockerfile

You can also use the Dockerfiles contained in the alias directories directly if possible. E.g. in 
Jenkins/Groovy scripts you write

        docker.build("<NAME>", "--pull <PATH-TO-ALIAS>").inside(<ARGS>) {
            <CODE>
        }

Which is equivalent to
        def IMAGE_ID = sh("<PATH_TO>/resolve.sh IMAGE_HADOLINT");
        docker.image(IMAGE_ID).inside(<ARGS>) {
            <CODE>
        }
