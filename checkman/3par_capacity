description:
 This check measures the total space of the filer and total space
 for each type of disk. It's behaviour is like a regular filesystem.
 You can define thresholds as known by other filesystem checks.

 If there is failed space above a configurable threshold (0 by default)
 the check will go to a {WARN} or {CRIT} state and show how many MiBs
 have failed.

inventory:
 One service is created for each device type and one summary service.
