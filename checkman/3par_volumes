description:
 This check measures the utilization of a virtual volume. You
 can define thresholds as known by other filesystem checks.

 Additionally there is information about the used space of this
 virtual volume on the filer, the provisioning type and the
 associated WWN. If available there is also information about
 the compaction and/or deduplication ratio.

 The check will also change the state if the virtual volume on
 the filer reports a degraded or failed state.

inventory:
 One service is created for each virtual volume.
