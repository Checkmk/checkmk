description:
 This check monitors the state of disks of an 3ware ATA RAID Controller. The
 Linux agent sends the neccessary data, if the command line utility {tw_cli}
 is found in the shells search path. The usual way is to install it into
 {/usr/local/bin} or {/usr/bin}.

 The utility {tw_cli} can be downloaded from {http://3ware.com/support/downloadpage.asp}.

item:
 The port identifier of the disk, e.g. {p0} or {p1}.

inventory:
 All logical units which don't have the status NOT-PRESENT are automatically inventorized. States like
 {OK} and {VERIFYING} are status OK. States like {SMART_FAILURE} are status warning. All other states are considered critical.
