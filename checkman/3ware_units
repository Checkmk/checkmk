 The usual way is to install it into {/usr/local/bin} or {/usr/bin}.

 All states other than {OK} or {VERIFYING} are considered {CRIT}.

 The utility {tw_cli} can be downloaded from {http://3ware.com/support/downloadpage.asp}.

 The unit number of the adapter, e.g. {"u0"}.

discovery:
 One service is created for each logical unit.
