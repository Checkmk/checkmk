description:
 The check analyzes the replication status of Microsoft Active Directory Domain
 Controllers.

 The check measures

 - the number of replication failures

 - the times of the last successful/failed replications

 The service goes to {WARN} state when

 - the warning threshold is reached

 The service goes to {CRIT} state when

 - the maximum failed threshold is reached

 - the last failed replication is newer than the last successful replication

 The threshold is configureable and the default values are 15 ({WARN}) and 20 ({CRIT}).

 The windows agent needs to be extended with the {ad_replication.bat} provided
 in {agents/windows/plugins}.

inventory:
 One service is created for each replication partner.

item:
 Site and the Domain Controller of the replication partner.
