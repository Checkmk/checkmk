description:
 This checks monitors the current measured for power supplies of the
 ADVA FSP 3000 scalable optical transport solution.

 No default thresholds are set in the check, since thresholds are configured
 in the device itself.
 The upper threshold for the current is read from the device.

 If the value is above the threshold the service goes {CRIT},
 otherwise it is {OK}.

 This check uses the FspR7-MIB.
