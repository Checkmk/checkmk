title: Adva FSP 3000 Optical Transport: Optical Interface Status

description:
 This checks monitors

 - the state

 - laser parameters

 of interfaces of the ADVA FSP 3000 scalable optical transport solution.

 Lower and upper critical limits can be configured for the input (received)
 and output (transmit) power of the laser. Per default, not limits are imposed,
 since meaningful values depend on the type of interface.

 The service goes {WARN} if no laser power information can be found.
 The service goes {WARN}/{CRIT} of the value is within the limits.

 Service interfaces (item name beginning with "S") do not have laser power
 information, so that non-existent laser power information is ignored for these
 interfaces.

 The check uses the IF-MIB for state ({ifAdminStatus} and {ifOperStatus}).
 The check uses the FspR7-MIB for laser parameters
 ({currentPmSnapshotOutputPower} and {currentPmSnapshotInputPower}).


item:
 There are three allowed ways to specify an interface: {1}: the last component
 of the SNMP OID number (as string), the {ifDescr} of the port or the {ifAlias}
 of the port. If you are using the alias, you have to make sure that it is
 unique by configuring useful aliases in the switch. Checkmk does not check
 for uniqueness.
 The default is to use the {ifDescr}.

inventory:
 One service is created for each interface that fulfills configurable conditions (porttype and portstate).
