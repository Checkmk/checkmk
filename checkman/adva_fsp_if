title: Adva FSP 3000 Optical Transport: Optical Interface Status

description:
 This checks monitors

 - the state

 - laser parameters

 of interfaces of the ADVA FSP 3000 scalable optical transport solution.

 Lower and upper critical limits can be configured for the input (received)
 and output (transmit) power of the laser. Per default, not limits are imposed,
 since meaningful values depend on the type of interface.

 The service goes {WARN} if no laser power information can be found.
 The service goes {CRIT} if the value is outside the user-defined limits.

 Service interfaces (item name beginning with "S") do not have laser power
 information, so that non-existent laser power information is ignored for these
 interfaces.

 The check uses the IF-MIB for state ({ifAdminStatus} and {ifOperStatus}).
 The check uses the FspR7-MIB for laser parameters
 ({currentPmSnapshotOutputPower} and {currentPmSnapshotInputPower}).

item:
 Either the interface description {ifDescr} if it is non-empty or otherwise
 the interface index {ifIndex}.

inventory:
 One service is created for each interface whose administrative state is "up"
 and whose type is 1, 6 or 56.
