description:
 This checks monitors the state and laser parameters of interfaces of the
 ADVA FSP 3000 scalable optical transport solution.

 State information is collected from the SNMP IF-MIB parameters {ifAdminStatus} and
 {ifOperStatus}. Laser information is collected from the FspR7-MIB parameters
 {currentPmSnapshotOutputPower} and {currentPmSnapshotInputPower}.

 Lower and upper critical limits can be configured for the input (received)
 and output (transmit) power of the laser. Per default, not limits are imposed,
 since meaningful values depend on the type of interface.

 A {WARN} state is triggered if no laser power information can be found.
 Service interfaces (item name beginning with "S") do not have laser power
 information, so that non-existent laser power information is ignored for these
 interfaces.

item:
 There are three allowed ways to specify an interface: {1}: the last component
 of the SNMP OID number (as string), the {ifDescr} of the port or the {ifAlias}
 of the port. If you are using the alias, you have to make sure that it is
 unique by configuring useful aliases in the switch. Check_MK does not check
 for uniqueness.
 The default is to use the {ifDescr}.

inventory:
 The inventory creates one service for each interface that fulfills
 configurable conditions.  Per default these are interfaces which currently
 are {up} and are of type {1} (other), {6} (ethernetCsmacd), and {56}
 (fibreChannel).
