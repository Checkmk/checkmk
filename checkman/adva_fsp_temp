description:
 This checks monitors the

 - temperature of ports

 - temperature of modules

 - temperature trends

 of the Adva FSP 3000 scalable optical transport solution.

 No default limits are set for the temperature, since limits are configured
 in thedevice itself.
 The upper and lower limits for the temperature are read from the device.

 The threshold for

 - temperature increase

 - time range

 - time period

 can be manually configured.

 If the current value is outside the allowed range the service goes {CRIT},
 otherwise it is {OK}.

 If the rate of temperature increase is above the rate per time range,
 the service goes {WARN} or {CRIT}, depending on the rate.

 The check can also predict in which period of time the upper limit
 for the temperature on the device will be reached and goes
 {WARN} or {CRIT} if this time period is shorter than the configured one.

 This check uses the FspR7-MIB.

item:
 Name of the module or port.

discovery:
 One service is created for each connected temperature sensor on all modules/ports
