description:
 This checks monitors the temperature of ports and modules of the Adva
 FSP 3000 scalable optical transport solution.

 No limits are set for the temperature, since limits are configured in the
 device itself. The upper and lower limits for the temperature are
 read from the device. If the current value is outside the allowed
 range the check is {CRIT}, otherwise it is {OK}.

 In addition {temperature trends} are monitored by the check. If the rate of
 temperature increase is above a configured rate per configured time range,
 the check becomes {WARN} or {CRIT}. The check can also predict in which
 period of time the upper limit for the temperature configured on the device
 will be reached and will become {WARN} or {CRIT} if this time period is
 shorter than the configured one.

item:
 Name of the module or port.

inventory:
 All temperature sensors on all modules/ports are detected
