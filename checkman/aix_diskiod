description:
 This check measures the disk IO of hard disks on AIX.
 The agent provides this information via the command {diskio -d}.

 This check is compatible with {diskstat},
 but only supports {{throughput}}, no latency and queue lengths.

 The {WARN}/{CRIT} levels can be configured manually for each read and write.

 Please read further details in the man page of {diskstat}.

item:
 Either {"SUMMARY"} for a summarized check of alls LUNs or the
 name of the disk device, e.g. {"hdisk15"}.

discovery:
  The inventory is configured via {diskstat_inventory_mode}. If this is set
  to {"single"} (the default), then one service will be created for each
  disk. If it is set to {"summary"} then only one service per host will be
  created that has at least one hard disk. If set to {"legacy"} then a
  separate service for read and write will be created (deprecated).

cluster:
  If configured for clustering, every service will sum up the measurements
  for disks with the same name.
