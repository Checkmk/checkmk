title: Throughput on AIX hard disks
agents: aix

description:

 This check measures the disk IO of hard disks on AIX. The agent provides this
 information via the command {diskio -d}. This check is compatible with {diskstat},
 but only supports throughput, no latency and queue lengths. Please read further
 details in the man page of {diskstat}.

item:
 Either {"SUMMARY"} for a summarized check of alls LUNs or the
 name of the disk device, e.g. {"hdisk15"}.

inventory:
  The inventory is configured via {diskstat_inventory_mode}. If this is set
  to {"single"} (the default), then one check will be created for each
  disk. If it is set to {"summary"} then only one service per host will be
  created that has at least one hard disk. If set to {"legacy"} then a
  separate check for read and write will be created (deprecated).
