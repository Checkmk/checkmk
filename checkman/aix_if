title: State of network interfaces on AIX hosts
agents: aix
catalog: os/networking

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the operational status, link speed, traffic, packet
 counts, and errors of network interfaces of AIX hosts using
 data sent by the Check_MK agent. It is fully compatible with {if} and
 {if64} and shares all of its features, including Perf-O-Meter, averaging,
 flexible configuration and NagVis weathermaps.

 Depending on the check parameters this check can go WARN or CRIT when the
 port status changes (i.e. is down), when the link speed changes (e.g. a
 port expected to be set to 1GBit/s operates only at 100MBit/s), when the
 absolute or procentual traffic of a port exceeds certain levels or if the
 rate of errors exceeds configurable limits.

 This check supports averaging the in- and outgoing traffic over a configurable
 range of time by using an exponentially weighted moving average.
 The averaging can be configured on
 a per host and per port base. This is done by adding a key {"average"}
 to the parameter dictionary with the number of minutes that the average
 should cover as its key. Port with averaging turned on output two additional
 performance values: the averaged traffic in bytes. If you have configured
 traffic levels, then those levels are applied to the averaged values.

item:
 There are three allowed ways to specify a port: {1}: the last component of
 the SNMP OID number (as string), the {ifDescr} of the port or the {ifAlias} of
 the port. If you are using the alias, you have to make sure that it is unique
 by configuring useful aliases in the switch. Check_MK does not check for uniqueness.

inventory:
 The inventory creates one service for each port that fulfills configurable conditions.
 Per default these are ports which are currently found {up} and are of types {6} (ethernetCsmacd),
 {32} (frameRelay) or {117} (gigabitEthernet).

 {Grouping:} In some situations you do not want to monitor a single
 interface but a group of interfaces that together form a pool.
 The {if} check supports such pools by defining groups.
 You can specifiy the members of a group by their port type and the item name(s) of
 the single interfaces. The data of all members is accumulated and put together
 in a single grouped interface service.

 You can specify the groups with the ruleset {if_groups}.
 Groups are defined as list of dictionaries.

 The keys are:

  {"name"}:   String. Name of the group within the service description

  {"iftype"}: Integer. Interface port type as integer

  {"include_items"}: List of Strings. Interface item name. This name depends
  on further settings like if_inventory_uses_alias or if_inventory_uses_description

  {"single"}(optional): Bool. Interfaces in this group do not show up
  as single service if "single" is set to True (Default: False)

  For example: if_groups = ([{"name" : "Group WLAN", "iftype" : 6, "single" : True}], ["lan"], ALL_HOSTS )
