description:
 This check monitors the mirror state of LVM logical volumes in the
 root volumegroup on AIX.

 It makes sure that all logical volumes are in the the {open,syncd}
 state. If a LV is in state {closed}, the check will give a {WARN}
 message to inform you.
 Exception: LVs of type {boot} are OK if they are in state {closed}

 It detects mirrored LVs and alerts with a {WARN} state, if there are
 obvious allocation errors, or a {CRIT} state, if the volume state is
 not {syncd}.

item:
 The name path of the VG and LV (e.g. {"rootvg/hd10"}).

inventory:
 On service is created for each logical volume in rootvg.
