 This check measures the current usage of physical RAM and
 virtual memory used by processes on AIX. You can define a warning
 and critical level for the usage of virtual memory,
 {not} for the usage of RAM.

 This check uses the same logic as {mem.used} - the memory check
 for Linux. Please see details there.

inventory:
  One service is created for each RAM device.
