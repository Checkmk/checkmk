 This check monitors

 - the state

 - the non-enabled paths

 of SCSI devices AIX hosts that are managed by the native multipath manager.

 The service will alert with a {WARN}

 - if the number of paths to a SCSI device changes

 - if 50% of paths are still enabled

 The service will alert with {CRIT}

 - if there are less than 50% of paths enabled.

 Note that the last path always stays {"Enabled"} on AIX, even if it encounters
 IO errors.

item:
 The WWID of the LUN.

inventory:
 One service is created for each LUN that is reported by
 the lspath utility if the device starts with {"hdisk"}
