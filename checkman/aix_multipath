description:
 This check monitors the state of SCSI devices AIX hosts that are managed
 by the native multipath manager. The check will alert with a WARNING if the
 number of paths to a SCSI device changes.
 The check will alert for any non-enabled paths. It will give a WARNING status 
 if more than 50% of paths are still enabled, or a CRITICAL status if there is
 less than this left. 
 Note that the last path always stays {"Enabled"} on AIX, even if it encounters
 IO errors.

item:
 The WWID of the LUN.

inventory:
 One service is created for each LUN that is reported by
 the lspath utility.
