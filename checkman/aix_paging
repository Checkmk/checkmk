description:
 This check measures the usage of paged AIX volumes.

 The warning and critical for the usage can be configured.

 You can also enable performance data for the traffic and latency
 for specific protocols (global, nfs, cifs, san, fcp, iscsi) via the parameters.

 The service goes {WARN}/{CRIT} if the usage goes over
 the configured warning/critical level

 {Trends:} This checks supports volume {trends}. This means that this check
 is able to compute the {change} of the used space over the time and can
 make a forecast into the future. It can estimate the time when
 the volume will be full.

 In the default configuration the check will compute the trend based on the
 data of the last 24 hours using a logarithmic average that gives more recent
 data a higher weight. Also data beyond the 24 hours will to some small degree be
 reflected in the computation. The advantage of this algorithm is a more
 precise prediction and a simpler implementation, which does not need any
 access to any RRDs or similar storage.

 Please note that when a volume is started to be monitored,
 the trend of the past is unknown and is assumed to be {zero}.
 It will take at least one trend range of time until the trend
 approximately reflects the reality.

item:
 Name of the volume as defined in the system

inventory:
 One service is created for each volume.
