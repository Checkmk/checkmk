 to AKCP daisyTemp sensor chain.

 This check uses the SPAGENT-MIB.

item:
 The description of the sensor as string as specified by the user during board configuration.

discovery:
 One service is created for each available (without the first, see description) temperature sensor
 if the port of the sensor is not -1 or 1.
