description:
 This check parses the information provided by the Apache status module.
 If you have enabled that module (on Debian/Ubuntu this is the default),
 then below the URL {/server-status} Apache show interesting information like:

 - Uptime since the server was started/restarted

 - Number of idle workers

 - Number of buys workers

 - Number of open slots

 - Total number of slots

 - Total number of accesses

 - CPU Load (for each worker, total for all workers)

 - Averages (number of requests per second, number of bytes served per second, number of bytes per request)

 - Scoreboard

 - Total connections

 - Information about connection (writing, keep alive, closing)

 - The number of busy servers

 - The number of idle servers

 The agent plugin {apache_status} fetches that data and this check processes it.

 The status is always {OK} but it fetches interesting performance data.

 As a preparation you need to install the agent plugin {apache_status}
 into your agent's plugins directory (usually {/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins}).
 The plugin tries to autodetect all running apache servers. If that fails
 for some reason you need to create the configuration file
 {/etc/check_mk/apache_status.cfg} and list your servers here. Write
 a Python list of dicts for protocol, servername and port.
 With the optional item 'page' its posible to change the status page from server-status to a
 name you want

inventory:
 One service is created for each Apache server.

item:
 A string-combination of servername and port, e.g. {127.0.0.1:5000}.
