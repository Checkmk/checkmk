title: Apache web server: Performance indicators
agents: linux
catalog: app/apache
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check parses the information provided by the Apache status module.
 If you have enabled that module (on Debian/Ubuntu this is the default),
 then below the URL {/server-status} Apache show interesting information
 about the number of connections and the like. The agent plugin {apache_status}
 fetches that data and this check processes it. The status is always OK,
 but it fetches interesting performance data.

 As a preparation you need to install the agent plugin {apache_status}
 into your agent's plugins directory (usually {/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins}).
 The plugin tries to autodetect all running apache servers. If that fails
 for some reason you need to create the configuration file
 {/etc/check_mk/apache_status.cfg} and list your servers here. Write
 a Python list of dicts for protocol, servername and port.
 With the optional item 'page' its posible to change the status page from server-status to a
 name you want

inventory:
 One service per Apache server will be created.

item:
 A string-combination of servername and port, e.g. {127.0.0.1:5000}.
