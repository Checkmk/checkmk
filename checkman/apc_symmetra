description:
 This check monitors some aspects of an APC Symmetra UPS:

 - battery status

 - output status

 - self test

 - battery capacity

 - battery replace

 - battery number batt packs

 - battery remaining time

 - calibration result

 - last diagnostic date

 You can configure {WARN} and {CRIT} levels for capacity (default: 80, 95 percent).

 You can configure the state for calibration (default: {OK}) and
 battery replace (default: {WARN}) aswell.

 The device sends its own state for some metrics (battery, battery replace, output, calibration).

 Battery state:

 - {OK}: "normal" (2)

 - {CRIT}: "low" (3), "in fault condition" (4)

 - {UNKNOWN}: "unknown" (1)

 Battery replace state:

 - {OK}: "no replacement needed" (1)

 - Depending on configuration (default: {WARN}): "battery needs replacement" (2)

 Output/Calibration state:

 - Depending on configuration (default: {OK}): "calibration invalid" and
   "on line" (2), "on smart boost" (4), "on smart trim" (12)

 - {CRIT}: No calibration in progress and none of the states (2, 4, 12)

 - {UNKNOWN}: None of the states (1-20)

 - {OK}: In all other cases

 This check uses the PowerNet-MIB.
