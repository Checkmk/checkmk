title: APC Symmetra UPS: Status of battery and output
agents: snmp

description:
 This check monitors eight aspects of an APC Symmetra UPS: {(1)} the battery status,
 {(2)} the output status, {(3)} the battery capacity, {(4)} the battery
 temperature, {(5)} the battery current, {(6)} the output voltage and
 {(7)} the output current, {(8)} the remaing run time. The output current and
 remaining run time are not checked against a level but are just displayed, {(9)} the current
 load in percent.

 The check output includes the calibration status of the UPS. During a
 calibration the check result in section {(2)} is OK even though the UPS is running
 on battery.
 The check reads the date of the last calibration and optionally applies an alternative
 level for the battery capacity on the day of the calibration. This is because the battery
 capacity is reduced after calibration and may cause an unwanted critical condition
 with the standard level. In addition a time span after the day of the calibration
 can be configured during which the post-calibration phase still persists.

examples:
 # Set the critical levels for the normal operation mode of all APC checks to:
 # - battery capacity at 90% or lower
 # - battery temperature to 38C or higher
 # - battery current to 10A or higher
 # - output voltage to 225V or lower
 # old method, unsets the post calibration levels
 apc_default_levels = ( 90, 38, 10, 225 )
 # new method
 apc_default_levels = {
     "levels": ( 90, 38, 10, 225 )
 }

 # also set the alternative level for the battery capacity and the delay time span
 apc_default_levels = {
     "levels": ( 90, 38, 10, 225 ),
     "post_calibration_levels": {
         "altcapacity": 50,          # in percent
         "additional_time_span": 60  # in minutes
 }

 # checkgroup_parameters syntax
 # please note that the name of the group is apc_symentra, NOT apc_symmetra !
 checkgroup_parameters.setdefault('apc_symentra', [])

 checkgroup_parameters['apc_symentra'] += [
    # All UPS in production get other critical levels
    ( { "levels": (85, 35, 2, 210) }, ["prod"], ALL_HOSTS ),
    ( { "output_load": (40, 50) }, ["power"], ALL_HOSTS ),
    # All UPS get post calibration level of 50%
    ( { "post_calibration_levels": { "altcapacity": 50 } }, ["prod"],ALL_HOSTS ),
    ( { "post_calibration_levels": { "additional_time_span": 60 } }, ["prod"], ALL_HOSTS ),
    ]

perfdata:
 This check outputs six performance values: the battery capacity,
 the battery temperature, the battery current, the output voltage,
 the output current in percent and the output current.

inventory:
 The inventory process checks if the device has a system description OIDs (.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0)
 and if the name of this OID is known to the test. If this is true the system is inventorized.

[parameters]
parameters(dict): parameters is a dictionary with two keys

 {"levels"}: a tuple of critical levels for battery capacity, temperature, current and output
 voltage. The numbers are integers.

 {"post_calibration_levels"}: a dictionary of two parameters: {"altcapacity"} is the alternative
 critical level for the battery capacity in the post-calibration phase in precent.  {"additional_time_span"}
 is a time span the post-calibration phase is extended past the day of the calibration in minutes.

parameters(tuple): The old format of a tuple of 4 values is also still supported, containing what
 is found in the key {"levels"} in the dictionary.


[configuration]
apc_default_levels (dict): This variable is preset to {{ "levels": ( 95, 40, 1, 220 ) }}
