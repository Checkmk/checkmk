title: APC Symmetra UPS: Status of battery and output
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/power

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors eight aspects of an APC Symmetra UPS: {(1)} the battery status,
 {(2)} the output status, {(3)} the battery capacity, {(4)} the battery
 temperature, {(5)} the battery current, {(6)} the output voltage and
 {(7)} the output current, {(8)} the remaing run time. The output current and
 remaining run time are not checked against
 a level but just being displayed.

examples:
 # Set the critical levels for all APC checks to:
 # - battery capacity at 90% or lower
 # - battery temperature to 38C or higher
 # - battery current to 10A or higher
 # - output voltage to 225V or lower
 apc_default_levels = (90, 38, 10, 225)

perfdata:
 This check outputs five performance values: the battery capacity,
 the battery temperature, the battery current, the output voltage and
 the output current.

inventory:
 Supported.

[parameters]
crit_capacity (int): The battery capacity in percent at and below which a critical state is be triggered
crit_batt_temp (int): The critical temperature of the battery
crit_batt_curr (int): The critical battery current in Ampere
crit_voltage (int): The output voltage at and below which a critical state is triggered.

[configuration]
apc_default_levels (int, int, int, int): The default levels to be used
   for inventorized checks. This variable is preset to {(95, 40, 1, 220)}
