title: APC Symmetra UPS: Status of battery and output
agents: snmp

description:

 This check monitors ten aspects of an APC Symmetra UPS: {(1)} the
 battery status, {(2)} the battery replacement status including the number
 of batteries to be replaced, {(3)} the output status, {(4)} the battery
 capacity, {(5)} the battery temperature, {(6)} the battery current, {(7)}
 the output voltage, {(8)} the output current, {(9)} the remaing run time,
 and {(10)} the current load in percent.

 The output current and remaining run time are not checked against a level,
 but just displayed. {(2)} is only displayed if a problem is found, the level
 is {WARN} if one battery needs to be replaced and {CRIT} if more than one
 battery needs to be replaced. {(1)} is not displayed if the state is normal
 but a problem in {(2)} was found.

 The check output includes the calibration status of the UPS. During a
 calibration the check result in section {(2)} is OK even though the UPS is
 running on battery.  The check reads the date of the last calibration and
 optionally applies an alternative level for the battery capacity on the
 day of the calibration. This is because the battery capacity is reduced
 after calibration and may cause an unwanted critical condition with the
 standard level. In addition a time span after the day of the calibration
 can be configured during which the post-calibration phase still persists.

examples:
 # Set the critical levels for the normal operation mode of all APC checks to:
 # - battery capacity at 90% or lower
 # - battery temperature to 38C or higher
 # - battery current to 10A or higher
 # - output voltage to 225V or lower
 # old method, unsets the post calibration levels
 apc_default_levels = ( 90, 38, 10, 225 )
 # new method
 apc_default_levels = {
     "levels": ( 90, 38, 10, 225 )
 }

 # also set the alternative level for the battery capacity and the delay time span
 apc_default_levels = {
     "levels": ( 90, 38, 10, 225 ),
     "post_calibration_levels": {
         "altcapacity": 50,          # in percent
         "additional_time_span": 60  # in minutes
 }

 # checkgroup_parameters syntax
 # please note that the name of the group is apc_symentra, NOT apc_symmetra !
 checkgroup_parameters.setdefault('apc_symentra', [])

 checkgroup_parameters['apc_symentra'] += [
    # All UPS in production get other critical levels
    ( { "levels": (85, 35, 2, 210) }, ["prod"], ALL_HOSTS ),
    ( { "output_load": (40, 50) }, ["power"], ALL_HOSTS ),
    # All UPS get post calibration level of 50%
    ( { "post_calibration_levels": { "altcapacity": 50 } }, ["prod"],ALL_HOSTS ),
    ( { "post_calibration_levels": { "additional_time_span": 60 } }, ["prod"], ALL_HOSTS ),
    ]

perfdata:
 This check outputs six performance values: the battery capacity,
 the battery temperature, the battery current, the output voltage,
 the output current in percent and the output current.

inventory:
 The inventory process checks if the device has a system description OIDs (.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0)
 and if the name of this OID is known to the test. If this is true the system is inventorized.

[parameters]
parameters(dict): parameters is a dictionary with the following keys:

 {"levels"}: a tuple of critical levels for battery capacity, temperature, current and output
 voltage. The numbers are integers.

 {"post_calibration_levels"}: a dictionary of two parameters: {"altcapacity"} is the alternative
 critical level for the battery capacity in the post-calibration phase in precent.  {"additional_time_span"}
 is a time span the post-calibration phase is extended past the day of the calibration in minutes.

 {"battime"}: A tuple (warn(int), crit(int)) of levels for the remaining battery time in seconds.
 This key is optional.

parameters(tuple): The old format of a tuple of 4 values is also still supported, containing what
 is found in the key {"levels"} in the dictionary.


[configuration]
apc_default_levels (dict): This variable is preset to {{ "levels": ( 95, 40, 1, 220 ) }}
