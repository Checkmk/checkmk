description:
 This checks just monitors the output power (in Watt) of the
 (usually three) phases of an APC Symmetra power supply.
 You can define warning and critical levels of power, below which
 the phases must not drop. Each phase is realized as a separate
 check.

examples:
 # Trigger warning/critical level if power drops below 100 or 20 Watt
 apc_power_default_levels = (100, 20)

perfdata:
 The current output power int Watt

inventory:
 Supported.

[parameters]
warn (int): The warning level: the power should not drop at or below this level
crit (int): The critical level: the power must not drop at or below this level

[configuration]
apc_power_default_levels (int, int): The default levels to be used
   for inventorized checks. This variable is preset to {(20, 1)}
