description:
 This check measures the amount of threads of Web Container Runtimes
 using the information collected by AppDynamics. Hence there is no need to
 query the application server itself.

 The WATO ruleset {JVM threads} applies {WARN}/{CRIT} levels to the threads part
 of this check.

 The service goes {WARN}/{CRIT} if the amount of threads exceeds these levels.

item:
 Name of the disk and either {{Heap}} or {{Non-Heap}}.

inventory:
 One service for each application.
