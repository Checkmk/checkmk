title: APT: Normal and Security Updates
agents: linux
catalog: os/misc
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check checks for available normal and security updates by trying
 {apt-get update} or {apt-get dist-upgrade} without actually installing
 packets.

 It works on Debian and Ubuntu. You need to deploy the plugin
 {mk_apt} in order for the check to work. It is recommended to install
 this plugin with asynchronous execution and at an interval with at
 least one hour.

 The service goes {CRIT} if there are security updates available.
 It goes {WARN}, if there are other updates available.

 These two states can be configured via a WATO rule.

 If updates are performed on a host the {WARN} and {CRIT} state will
 remain until the next check interval. To invalidate the cached data
 and to trigger the check execution immediately, you can run the
 command:

 {touch -t 197012081200 /var/lib/check_mk_agent/cache/*mk_apt.cache}

 If you don't want to invalidate the cache manually you can copy the
 apt hook under {~/share/doc/check_mk/treasures/mk_apt_hook} to
 {/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/98mk-apt}.

inventory:
 One service is created for each system where the {mk_apt}
 plugin is being installed and the command {apt-get} is present.
