description:
 Monitors memory and swap space on Arbor Peakflow SP devices.
 This is based around a percentage reported in a device specific
 mib.
 The device reports more detailed memory statistics in a generic
 mib handled by hr_mem but that info is not officially supported
 and seems to report wrong data.

 Warn/Crit levels can be configured through the rule
 "Memory and Swap usage on Arbor devices"

inventory:
 One service is created.
