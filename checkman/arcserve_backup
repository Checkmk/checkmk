description:
 Checks if Backup Jobs did finish successfully on an Arcserve Backup System.

 Therefore it queries the database on the backup server. It needs
 the arcserve_backup.ps1 agent plugin to be installed there.

 Please note: On the Arcserve database TCP/IP and named pipes need to
 be activated for the plugin to work.

 The check returns

 - {OK} if the backup job did finish with an OK message

 - {WARN} if the job reported warnings

 - {CRIT} if the job did report errors

 - {UNKN} if the job did finish with an unidentified message

 Number of directories, number of files and size are only reported but
 do never trigger any non-OK state.

item:
 The name of the backup.

inventory:
 One service is created for each backup configured.

 Please note: This is independent of the number of hosts backuped in one
 backup job. Only the total state of a backup (over all contained hosts)
 is reported.
