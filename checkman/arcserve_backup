description:
 Checks if Backup Jobs did finish successfully on an Arcserve Backup
 System. Therefor it queries the database on the backup server. It needs
 the arcserve_backup.ps1 agent plugin to be installed there.

 Returns {OK} if the backup job did finish with an OK message, {WARN} if
 the job reported warnings and {CRIT} if the job did report errors.
 {UNKN} is returned if the job did finish with an unidentified message.

 Number of directories, number of files and size are only reported but
 do never trigger any non-OK state.

item:
 The name of the backup.

perfdata:
 Returns three values: The number of directories backuped in the last
 execution of the backup, the number of files backuped and the total
 size backuped in Bytes.

inventory:
 Finds one service for every backup configured.

 Please note: This is independent of the number of hosts backuped in one
 backup job. Only the total state of a backup (over all contained hosts)
 is reported.
