title: AWS DynamoDB: Limits
agents: aws
catalog: cloud/aws
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors limits in terms of Read and Write Capacity Units for
 AWS/DynamoDB. The check monitors both per-table limits for provisioned
 tables as well as region-wide limits. Note that this service does not
 apply to on-demand tables, since they do not have any fixed limits in
 terms of Read or Write Capacity Units. Additionally, the check also
 monitors the number of tables per region.

 To make this check work, you have to configure the related special
 agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}.

 Default levels are set to 80, 90 percent and the default max. value is
 fetched from the API or set to the default value provided by AWS, ie.:

 - Account-wide Read and Write Capacity Units: usually 80,000

 - Per-table Read and Write Capacity Units: usually 40,000

 - Account-wide number of tables per region: 256

 These levels are configurable using the WATO rule "AWS/DynamoDB Limits".

 Note that if limits are enabled, all (provisioned) tables are fetched,
 regardless of possibly configured restrictions to names or tags.

discovery:
 One service is created per monitored AWS region.
