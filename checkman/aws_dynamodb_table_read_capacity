description:
 This check monitors the read capacity of DynamoDB tables based on the
 Cloudwatch metric "ConsumedReadCapacityUnits". It reports both the
 average consumption as well as the minimum and maximum consumption of
 individual requests. The check also computes the average usage in
 percent based on a limit value on the average consumption. For
 provisioned tables, this limit value can be fetched from the API. For
 on-demand tables, you have to configure a limit value yourself,
 otherwise, the average usage will not be computed.

 Upper and lower levels for this check can be configured using the
 rule "AWS/DynamoDB Read/Write Capacity". By default, there are upper
 levels on the average usage at 80/90%.

 To make this check work, you have to configure the related special
 agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}.
