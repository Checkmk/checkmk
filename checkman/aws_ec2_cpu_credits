title: AWS EC2: Instance Credit Usage
agents: aws
catalog: cloud/aws
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the number of CPU credits spent by the instance for CPU
 utilization and the number of earned CPU credits that an instance has accrued
 since it was launched or started. The reported values for the CPU credit usage
 correspond to time intervals of 5 minutes.

 To make this check work you have to configure the related special agent {Amazon
 Web Services (AWS)}.

 You can configure lower levels for {WARN}/{CRIT} (default: 10, 5). The service goes
 {WARN}/{CRIT} if the credit usage drops below these levels.

discovery:
 One service is created if all required metrics (CPUCreditUsage, CPUCreditBalance) are given.
