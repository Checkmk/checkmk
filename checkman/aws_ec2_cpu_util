description:
 This check monitors the percentage of allocated EC2 compute units that are
 currently in use on the AWS EC2 instance.

 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}.

 You can configure upper levels for {WARN}/{CRIT} (default: 90.0, 95.0).

 The service goes {WARN}/{CRIT} if the CPU utilization exceeds these levels.

inventory:
 One service is created if all required metrics (CPUUtilization) are given.
