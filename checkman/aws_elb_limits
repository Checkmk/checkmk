description:
 This check monitors the AWS/ELB limits, ie. the number of
 allowed load balancers and the registered instances and
 listeners per load balancer.

 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}.

 Default levels are set to 80, 90 percent and the default max.
 value is fetched from the API, ie.

 - 20 load balancers

 - 100 listeners per load balancer

 - 1000 registered instances per load balancer.

 These levels are configurable.

 If limits are enabled all load balancers are fetched regardless of
 possibly configured restriction to names or tags.

discovery:
 One service is created per monitored AWS region.
