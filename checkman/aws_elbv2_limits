 Default levels are set to 80, 90 percent and the default max.
 value is fetched from the API, ie.

 - Application Load balancers, 20

 - Application Load Balancer Rules, 100

 - Application Load Balancer Listeners, 50

 - Application Load Balancer Target Groups, 3000

 - Application Load balancer Certificates, 25

 - Network Load balancers, 20

 - Network Load Balancer Listeners, 50

 - Network Load Balancer Target Groups, 3000

 - Load balancers Target Groups, 3000

 These levels are configurable.

 If limits are enabled all load balancers are fetched regardless of
 possibly configured restriction to names or tags.

 One service is created per monitored AWS region.
