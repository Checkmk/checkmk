description:
 This check monitors memory consumption and code size metrics.
 The code size will always be monitored.
 The memory size can only be monitored if the setting "Logs and metrics" is activated (by default) for AWS Lambda.
 WARNING: The AWS Cloudwatch Insights service will be used for parsing the log files. This causes additional costs.

 - code size: Measures the code size of the Lambda function.
   The default levels for this metric are measured in percent of the region \"code size\" limit.
   Additionally absolute code size levels in bytes can also be configured.
   The service goes WARN/CRIT if the code size is above the default level code size of AWS Lambda \"code size\" or
   the code size is above the configured absolute duration levels.

 - memory used: Measures the memory consumption.
   The default levels for this metric are measured in percent of the Lambda function \"memory\" limit.
   The memory metrics will only be reported if the lambda function was used in the last monitoring period.
   Additionally absolute memory levels in bytes can also be configured.
   The service goes WARN/CRIT if the memory consumption is above the default level percentage of AWS Lambda \"memory\" or
   the memory consumption is above the configured absolute memory levels.

 To make this checkplugin work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}.
 Additionally the permissions for executing AWS Cloudwatch Lambda Insights queries must be given (given by default).

item:
 Name of the region, AWS Lambda function name.
