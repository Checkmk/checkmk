title: AWS RDS: Replica Lag
agents: aws
catalog: cloud/aws

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the time a read replica DB instance lags
 behind the source DB instance. For PostgreSQL databases, the check
 also monitors the lagging size of the replica lagging the most in
 terms of write-ahead log (WAL) data received (OldestReplicationSlotLag).

 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}.

 No default levels are set. Upper levels are configurable for
 the replica lag age and oldest replication slot lag size via
 the rule "AWS/RDS Replica lag".

item:
 Name of the instance and region name (to avoid duplicate services
 in case of multi-region monitoring).

inventory:
 One service is created for each database if all required metrics
 (ReplicaLag) are given.
