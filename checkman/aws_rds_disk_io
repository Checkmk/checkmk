description:
 This check monitors the disk IO of AWS/RDS

 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}.

 No default levels are set, but levels are configurable via the
 rule "Levels for disk IO".

item:
 Name of the instance and region name (to avoid duplicate services
 in case of multi-region monitoring).

discovery:
 One service is created for each database if all required metrics
 (DiskQueueDepth, ReadIOPS, ReadLatency, ReadThroughput, WriteIOPS,
 WriteLatency and WriteThroughput) are given.
