description:
 This check monitors the AWS/S3 limits, ie. the number of
 allowed buckets withing a region.
 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}.

 Default levels are set to 80, 90 percent and the default max.
 value of 100. These levels are configurable.

 If limits are enabled all buckets are fetched regardless of
 possibly configured restriction to names or tags.

inventory:
 One service per bucket will be created.
