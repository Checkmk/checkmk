description:
 This check monitors the total number of requests and the
 number of get, put, delete, head post, select and list
 requests made for objects in an AWS S3 bucket. Values are
 reported in counts per second and as a fraction of the
 total number of requests.

 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}. Furthermore, you
 have to enable requests metrics in the AWS/S3 console. This is
 a paid feature.

 No default levels are set. Upper levels on the fractions are
 configurable.
