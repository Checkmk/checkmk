title: AWS S3: HTTP Errors
agents: aws

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the rate of all HTTP requests and the rates
 of HTTP 4xx and 5xx client error status code requests made
 to an Amazon S3 bucket. The 4xx- and 5xx-rates are reported
 both in counts per second and as a fraction of all HTTP
 requests.

 To make this check work, you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}. Furthermore, you
 have to enable request metrics in the AWS/S3 console. This is
 a paid feature. Note that the filter name has to be set to
 `EntireBucket`, as is recommended in the AWS documentation for
 a filter that applies to all objects. The AWS special agent
 uses this filter name to query S3 request metrics from the AWS
 API.

 No default levels are set. Upper levels on the fractions are
 configurable via the rule "AWS/S3 HTTP Errors".

item:
 Name of the bucket

discovery:
 One service is created for each bucket if all required metrics
 (AllRequests, 4xxErrors, 5xxErrors) are given.
