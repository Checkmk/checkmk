description:
 This check monitors the rate of all HTTP requests and the rates
 of HTTP 4xx and 5xx client error status code requests made
 to an Amazon S3 bucket. The 4xx- and 5xx-rates are reported
 both in counts per second and as a fraction of all HTTP
 requests.

 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}. Furthermore, you
 have to enable requests metrics in the AWS/S3 console. This is
 a paid feature.

 No default levels are set. Upper levels on the fractions are
 configurable via the rule "AWS/S3 HTTP Errors".

item:
 Name of the bucket

discovery:
 One service is created for each bucket if all required metrics
 (AllRequests, 4xxErrors, 5xxErrors) are given.
