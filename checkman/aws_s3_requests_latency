description:
 This check monitors the average per-request time

 - from the first byte received to the last byte sent
   to an Amazon S3 bucket.

 - from the complete request being received by an Amazon S3
   bucket to when the response starts to be returned.

 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}. Furthermore, you
 have to enable requests metrics in the AWS/S3 console. This is
 a paid feature.

 No default levels are set. Upper levels on the first latency
 are configurable via the rule "AWS/S3 Latency".

item:
 Name of the bucket

discovery:
 One service is created for each bucket if all required metrics
 (TotalRequestLatency) are given.
