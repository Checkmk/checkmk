description:
 This check monitors the rates of bytes downloaded and
 uploaded for requests to an AWS S3 bucket. Only requests
 that contain a request body are counted.

 To make this check work, you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}. Furthermore, you
 have to enable request metrics in the AWS/S3 console. This is
 a paid feature. Note that the filter name has to be set to
 `EntireBucket`, as is recommended in the AWS documentation for
 a filter that applies to all objects. The AWS special agent
 uses this filter name to query S3 request metrics from the AWS
 API.

 The service is always {OK}.

item:
 Name of the bucket

discovery:
 One service is created for each bucket if all required metrics
 (BytesDownloaded, BytesUploaded) are given.
