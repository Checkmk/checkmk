description:
 This check provides information about VMs configured in the Microsoft Azure cloud.

 The check counts VMs grouped by their provisioning and power states.

 The service state resulting from the different counts can be configured using the
 rule "Azure Virtual Machines Summary".

inventory:
 One service is created on every Checkmk host that receives information
 about the VMs via the piggyback mechanism.
 To configure which those are, see the configuration of the Azure agent.
