 Lower and upper warning and critical levels are enforced and may be
 configured.  A non-OK state is triggered according to these levels.

discovery:
 One service is created for each sensor of a PDU.
 At least one service is created for an internal sensor on the device.

item:
 The name of the sensor, which is either "internal" or "external {<ID>}",
 and {<ID>} is the numerical ID of the sensor.
