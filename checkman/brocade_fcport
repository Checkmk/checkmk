description:
 This checks monitors a FibreChannel port of a Brocade FC switch
 in great detail. It obsoletes the older checks {fc_brocade_port} and
 {fc_brocade_port_detailed}. The check goes critical under the following conditions:

 {[1]} The physical state, operational state or adminstrative state of the port is not
 as expected.

 {[2]} The current or averaged throughput exceeds certain absolute or
 percentual levels.

 {[3]} An error counter exceeds its  configured levels (CRC errors, Enc-OUT
 Enc-IN, frames, no Tx credits, C3 discards)

 Averaging: This check supports averaging on all counters. Averaging is
 turned on but setting the check parameter {"average"} to a number of minutes.
 In that case the check produces additional performance data for each parameter
 and all warning/error levels are only applied on the averaged value, not on
 the current one. This is especially helpful when using levels on the throughput.

 Note: The counters CRC errors and Enc-OUT are represented as percentages in
 relation to the number of received frames. C3 discards and no Tx credits are
 in relation to the number of sent frames.

item:
 The item is the port-number as two-digit or three-digit string (on switches
 with 100 or more ports) as printed on the switch (note: the SNMP-index of
 port {00} is {1}!). For ISL ports (inter-switch-links), an {ISL} is appended
 to the item, e.g. {00 ISL}. This allows you to create rules which select
 different check parameters for ISL and normal ports without specifying each
 individual port. Also, if you have configured port names, they will appear
 in the check item (and thus the service description). This can be turned
 off.

discovery:
  One service is created for each operational port. What this exactly means
  can be configured (see CONFIGURATION VARIABLES).
