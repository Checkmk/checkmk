description:
 Checks the Module CPU Utilization of a NI-MLX or BR-MLX module in Brocade
 NetIron MLX switching / routing devices.

 {WARN} or {CRIT} is returned, if the usage in the last 60 sec was above
 given thresholds. {OK} is returned otherwise.

 Please note: Even if the check reports and graphs the CPU Utilization in
 the last 1/5/60/300 sec, the thresholds are only checked against the value
 of the last 60 sec. The other values are informational only.

item:
 If a module description is delivered by SNMP, the item is build from the
 module ID plus the description. Otherwise it is just the ID.

inventory:
 One service is created for each NI-MLX or BR-MLX module.
 Modules with state "empty" or "Blocked for full height card" are omitted.
