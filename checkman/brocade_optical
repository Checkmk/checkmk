description:
 This checks monitors the signal quality of optical ports on Brocade switches.
 It takes into account RX and TX power levels as well as the temperature at the port
 and, optionally, the same readings for all individual lanes.
 Currently the {OK}, {WARN}, {CRIT} levels are not configurable in check_mk, instead
 the status as reported by the device itself is reported.

item:
 Portnumber of the interface. Depending on the length of the portnumber it will be filled with {{0}}s.

inventory:
 One service is created for each port that fulfills the conditions configured
 for network and switch port discovery and reports optical signal quality readings.
