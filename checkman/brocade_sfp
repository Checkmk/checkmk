description:
 This check monitors the power level in dBm of brocade SFPs, as well as current and voltage.

item:
 The item is the port-number as two-digit or three-digit string (on switches
 with 100 or more ports) as printed on the switch (note: the SNMP-index of
 port {00} is {1}!). For ISL ports (inter-switch-links), an {ISL} is appended
 to the item, e.g. {00 ISL}. This allows you to create rules which select
 different check parameters for ISL and normal ports without specifying each
 individual port. Also, if you have configured port names, they will appear
 in the check item (and thus the service description). This can be turned
 off.

inventory:
  One service is created for each operational port. What this exactly means
  can be configured (see CONFIGURATION VARIABLES).
