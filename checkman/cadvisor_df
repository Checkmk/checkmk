description:

 This check measures the filesystem stats of containers
 and/or pods.

 This check obtains its metrics values through Prometheus. In order to allow
 generation of cAdvisor related df services, the user needs to enable
 the cAdvisor option under the Prometheus Datasource Programs ruleset.
 This check uses the same mechanisms as the df check.
