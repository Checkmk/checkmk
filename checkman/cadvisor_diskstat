 This check measures the throughput of block devices (disks) of containers
 and/or pods.

 This check measures the memory usage of a container/pod respecting
 the limit configured for the container/pod

 This check obtains its metrics values through Prometheus. In order to allow
 generation of cAdvisor related diskstat services, the user needs to enable
 the cAdvisor option under the Prometheus Datasource Programs ruleset.
 This check uses the same mechanisms as the diskstat check.
