description:

 This check measures the memory stats of containers
 and/or pods. The memory usage for containers is shown relative to
 its parent pod. The memory usage for pods is shown either relative to the
 available machine memory or, if available, relative to the pod's permitted memory cap.

 This check obtains its metrics values through Prometheus. In order to allow
 generation of cAdvisor related memory services, the user needs to enable
 the cAdvisor option under the Prometheus Datasource Programs ruleset.

inventory:
 One service is created for each memory unit.
