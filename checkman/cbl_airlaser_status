description:
 The check can be used to monitor the CBL AirLaser Powerup status.

 The CBL Airlaser is a device to transparently transport Gigabit Ethernet
 over an optical link with optional microwave fallback.

 The status of the AirLaser should usually be normal.
 After power up the system performs some self-tests.
 This check aquires the results from the sysStatus OID in the
 {CBL-AIRLASOR-IP1000-MIB}

 Minor airlaser problems are reported as a warning condition, major failures
 as "anything failed"

 snmp-Status    to     nagios-status:

 (1)normal operation:  {OK}

 (2)testing mode:      {WARNING}

 (3)warning condition: {WARNING}

 (4)anything failed:   {CRIT}


inventory:
 One service is created for each remote device
 if the CBL-AIRLASOR-IP1000 MIB is supported.
