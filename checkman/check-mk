description:
  This check is responsible for retrieving the status information needed
  for monitoring a host from the configured data sources for the host.
  The data sources can include configured agents, special agents, SNMP,
  piggyback data and management boards of hosts. Its overall service
  status depends on the success of these tasks. The resulting states
  can be configured using the ruleset "Status of the Checkmk services".

  Once the monitoring information is received, it executes the Checkmk
  checks and updates all passive services that are configured for the
  host. In case this host produced piggyback data for other hosts, these
  information are updated during execution of this service.
