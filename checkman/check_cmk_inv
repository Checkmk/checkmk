description:
  This check has two purposes: performing a hardware/software-inventory for a host
  and then optionally checking for changes in the hardware or software. In order
  for the inventory to yield useful data you need to deploy the agent plugin
  {mk_inventory} on Linux, Windows and UNIX. SNMP devices can do inventory without
  any additional plugin.

  By creating a rule with a parameter for this check you can get warned about
  changes in the hardware or software. This is optional.
