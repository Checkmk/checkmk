description:
 This is an active check that sends a DNS query to a DNS nameserver.

 You can give the DNS name to query for.

 It can compare the IP it gets back against a given IP and return {CRIT} if
 they do not match. It can check the DNS server to be authoritativ for the
 lookup. It can check response times against given thresholds for {WARN}
 and {CRIT}.

 This check can be configured by Wato.
