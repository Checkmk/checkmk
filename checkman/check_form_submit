description:
 This check performs HTTP requests with some advanced features like
 a) Detecting, populating and submitting HTML forms
 b) Accepts and uses cookies
 c) Follos HTTP redirects
 d) Extends HTTP headers

 Several hosts may be specified at once. For this case warning an critical levels may
 be given and are applied to the number of successful responses.

 This check can be configured by WATO.

 See the {usage} page of the check for details about the invocation on the command line.

Examples:
 Call the page test.php, find the single form on that page and
 submit it with default values:

  ./check_form_submit -I localhost -u /test.php

 Same as above, but expect the string "Hello" in the response
 of the form:

 ./check_form_submit -I localhost -u /test.php -e "Hello"

 Login as omdadmin with password omd, in the OMD site named /event,
 let the login redirect to the wato.py and expect the string WATO
 in this response:

 ./check_form_submit -I localhost -u /event -q '_origtarget=wato.py&_username=omdadmin&_password=omd' -e 'WATO'
