description:
 This active check logs into an IMAP or EWS account and optionally monitors the age of the oldest
 or newest mail as well as the total count of mails in one or multiple mailboxes.

 There is a caveat though: Many mailservers don't support retrieving mails sorted by
 age and it would be very costy (in terms of traffic and check time) to retrive all
 mails. To work around this, the check retrieves a configurable number of the least
 recently and most recently modified mails from the server and checks the age of those.
 Unless mails get moved between mailboxes, the least recenly modified mail should also
 be the oldest one and the most recently modified mail should be the newest.
 
 As for EWS the mailbox to be contacted can be specified by an email address which in contrast to
 IMAP might be different from the credentials username (but doesn't have to be).
 For that case this email address (a.k.a. 'PrimarySmtpAddress') can be specified in the setup
 for this check (available for EWS only).
