description:
 This checks makes sure that the Checkmk agent on the target system
 has configured certain IP address based access restrictions. The check
 needs the agent to be configured with those restrictions. The windows
 agent is configured via an {.ini}-file. The Linux agent is configured
 via {/etc/xinetd.d/check_mk}.

inventory:
 One check is created per host, if {check_mk_only_from_default} is explicitely
 set in {main.mk} and the agent provides an {OnlyFrom:} header in the section
 {<<<check_mk>>>}.
