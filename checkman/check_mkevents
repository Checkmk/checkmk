description:
 Checks the Event Console for open events for a host - either for any events for
 for those with certain application names. This check can be used for having the
 event status visible in the normal monitoring views. Note: only events of those
 hosts that are part of the monitoring can be checked that way.

 The service goes OK if all open events have OK state or if there are no open
 events. Otherwise the state will take the worst state of all open events. Optionally
 acknowledged events can be ignored.
