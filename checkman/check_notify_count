description:
 Check the number of sent notifications per contact using the plugin check_notify_count
 provided with Checkmk. This plugin counts the total number of notifications sent by the local
 monitoring core and creates graphs for each individual contact. You can configure thresholds
 on the number of notifications per contact in a defined time interval.

 This plugin queries livestatus to extract the notification related log entries from the
 log file of your monitoring core. By default, in OMD environments, the livestatus of the local
 site is queried.

 This check can be configured by WATO.

 See the {usage} page of the check for details about the invocation on the command line.

Examples:
 Count all notifications within last 60 minutes:

 ./check_notify_count -r 60

 Count all notifications within last 60 minutes and raise alerts when too many notifications
 are sent to a contact:

 ./check_notify_count -r 60 -w 20 -c 30
