description:
 This performs an active check of an SFTP server by testing if a connection
 is successful. Optionally it is possible to put a file to the server. It is
 not neccessary to create a file as the check will do that if the given file
 does not exist. Also same or another file or the timestamp of a file of the
 server can be fetched. The Service will go {CRIT} if one of the tests fails.
