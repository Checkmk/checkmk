description:
  This is an active check that connects to a database server, sends an SQL
  statement to that server, and checks for the following result:

  The query must return three columns, a number, a text, and optional
  performance data in the third column. The columns are comma-separated.
  Performance data must be in the standard format of nagios performance data.
  If upper and lower levels are given, the number is checked
  against these levels and the according state is being computed.
  Otherwise the number ist treated as a Nagios state (0,1,2,3).
  State, text and the performance data are being returned.

  The check works with MySQL, Postgresql, MSSQL and Oracle databases using the
  python drivers MySQLdb, psycopg2, pymssql and cx_Oracle. For cx_Oracle the
  Oracle instantclient needs to be installed as well, and the
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH needs to be modified to point to the libclntsh.so of
  that package.

  The oracle check supports procedure calls. It must return excactly one output
  variable. The value of the variable must be in the same format as the return
  value of the sql statement described above.

  This check can be configured by WATO.

  See the {usage} page of the check for details about the invocation on the command line.
