description:
 This is an active check that connects to any given TCP port and checks
 if the connection could be established. Therefor it can be used to check
 nearly any TCP based service on the monitored machine. SSL can be activated
 to connect to any SSL encrypted service.

 Thresholds for the response time can be configured for {WARN} and {CRIT}.
 You can give a string to send over the connection and define a string to
 expect in the response. A given string to send for terminating the connection
 can be configured too.

 If using SSL you can configure to check for expiration of the SSL certificate
 within the next days.

 This check can be configured by Wato.

 One value: The response time in seconds.
