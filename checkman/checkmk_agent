description:

 This plugin makes sure that the Checkmk agent deploy mechanism (if used) is working properly.
 It checks the time of the last successful connect to the deployment server and if there are any error messages.

 Also it monitors the deployed agent plugins and local checks.
 In any case it will display their respective number.
 If levels are configured useing the WATO ruleset "Checkmk agent plugins", the plugins versions are compared to the target versions.
 For this to work, the versions must be included in the plugins in one of the standardised formats:
  * CMK_VERSION="2.1.0p12" (e.g. shell, php)
  * __version__=... (python)

 If the version of a plugin is found but can not be parsed, the service wil go to UNKNOWN.
 You can exclude plugins from the version check using a regex pattern in the WATO ruleset.

discovery:
 One service is created.
