description:
 This check monitors the deployed agent plugins and local checks.
 In any case it will display their respective number.
 If levels are configured useing the WATO ruleset "Checkmk agent plugins", the plugins versions are compared to the target versions.
 For this to work, the versions must be included in the plugins in one of the standardised formats:
  * CMK_VERSION="2.1.0p12" (e.g. shell, php)
  * __version__=... (python)

 If the version of a plugin is found but can not be parsed, the service wil go to UNKNOWN.
 You can exclude plugins from the version check using a regex pattern in the WATO ruleset.

discovery:
 One summary service is created.
