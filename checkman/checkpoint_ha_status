description:
 This check monitors status and displays a few details of the High
 Availability Modul in checkpoint firewalls.

 This module reports three fields called something along the lines
 of "status" and it's not entirely certain what each of them means.
 One seems to only indicate whether the device is "active" or "standby",
 the other two seem to indicate problems.
 Therefore this check will be in status {CRIT} if either "status code"
 or "blocking state" signals a problem (or any not-yet-observed state),
 {OK} otherwise.

discovery:
 One service is created.
