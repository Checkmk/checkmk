title: Health of CIFS Mounts Mounted on UNIX/ Linux
agents: linux, aix
catalog: os/services
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check probes the availability of CIFS mounts. The agent sends the
 status of all NFS mounts, if the command line utility {waitmax} is available
 (it is is used to avoid hanging if the server is not responding). The
 probe is done by trying a {stat -f} (system call {statfs(2)}) on the mount
 point. If that lasts longer then 2 seconds, then the server is considered
 to be not responding.

 When you install the agent manually, please do not forget to also
 install {waitmax} into {/usr/bin}.  That file is shipped together with
 the agent. When {waitmax} is missing, the agent will silently omit the
 section {nfsmounts}.

 If the CIFS mount is "stale", then {stat -f} returns immediately but with
 a size of {0}. The check detects that and results in a warning state.

 To configure usage levels and whether or not to output metrics use the
 WATO rule "Network filesystem - overall status and usage (e.g. NFS)"

item:
 The mount point.

inventory:
  One service is created for each CIFS mount.
  This is doneby scanning {/proc/mounts} (linux) or using the mount command (aix).
  The file {/etc/fstab} is irrelevant.
