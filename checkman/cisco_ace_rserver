description:

 This check monitors the status of the so-called real servers of Cisco
 switches with the Application Control Engine (ACE) module. It uses snmp
 to extract information from the CISCO-ENHANCED-SLB MIB.

 The check monitors the operational and the administrative state of each
 rserver, as well as the current number of connections. The criticality of
 the check is determined from the operational state: if the operational
 state is {in service}, the check is {OK}. If the operational state is
 {probe testing} or {standby}, the check is {WARN}. Otherwise, it is {CRIT}.
 If the administrative state is {out of service}, the worst total criticality
 is {WARN}.

item:
 The name of the real server, or, if this is not configured on the device,
 the IP-address of the real server.

inventory:
 One service is created for each real server.
