description:
 The Cisco "Adaptive Security Appliances" (ASA) support to run as a failover
 cluster.
 This check allows to monitor whether such a cluster is running normal, or
 if it has failed over to the partner device for any reason.

 The check will report {OK} as long as the correct unit has the role "active" or "standby".
 If a failover has occured, the check will report a {WARNING} status.

 If an unknown status is encountered (other than 9 or 10 in the status OIDs)
 it will go to {UNKNOWN}.

 The check is not tested against un-clustered ASA devices.

item:
