description:
 Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) can be operated as failover
 pairs. This check monitors whether such a pair is running normally,
 or if it has failed over to the partner device.

 The check will report {OK} as long as the correct unit has the role
 "active" or "standby". If a failover has occured, the check will report
 {WARN}. Furthermore, the check also monitors the state of the local and
 the remote device and goes {WARN} if they are not active or standby.
 Finally, the check will go {CRIT} if the failover link is not up.

 Roles and all monitoring states can can be configured using the ruleset
 "Failover states".
