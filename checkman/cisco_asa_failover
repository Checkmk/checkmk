description:
 The Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) support to run as a failover
 pair. This check monitors whether such a pair is running normally, or
 if it has failed over to the partner device for any reason.

 The check will report {OK} as long as the correct unit has the role "active"
 or "standby". If a failover has occured, the check will report a {WARNING}
 status. Furthermore, the check also monitors the state of the local and the
 remote device and goes {WARN} if they are not active or standby. Finally,
 the check will go {CRIT} if the failover link is not up.

 Roles and all states can can be configured.

 If an unknown status is encountered (any integer not in the range 1 - 10 in
 the status OIDs), the check will go {UNKNOWN}.
