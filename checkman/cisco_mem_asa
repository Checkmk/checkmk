item:
 Memory pool name

description:
 This Check does the same as the normal cisco_mem check. The only difference is
 that this check only monitors the System memory and MEMPOOL_DMA pools. The reason is a
 bug in the ASA firmware: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-next-generation-firewalls/116423-troubleshoot-asa-snmp.html

inventory:
 One service is created for the I/O pool and one for the CPU pool.
