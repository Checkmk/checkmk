title: Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances Version 9.x: System Memory
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/network/cisco
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This Check does the same as the normal cisco_mem check. The only difference is
 that this check only monitors the System memory. The reason is a
 bug in the ASA firmware: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-next-generation-firewalls/116423-troubleshoot-asa-snmp.html

 Moreover there are problems with newer ASA version 9.x: from cisco
 Deprecate 32-bit SNMP OIDs for Memory UtilizationCSCuu46705DescriptionSymptom:
 Currently the ASA has two ways to check memory via SNMP. 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.48 can be polled
 and the OIDs under that will dig into each individual memory pool, including DMA and
 GLOBAL SHARED but all the counters are 32-bit which means that the information contained
 in them is wrong for some of the modern ASAs that run with more memory. Also, polling some
 of these OIDs will cause CPU-hogs on the ASA, as per CSCtx43501.
 In recent codes, you can poll the CISCO-ENHANCED-MEMPOOL-MIB, 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.221, and it
 will provide overall system memory, but it does so with 64-bit counters as well. This is
 the only way to get valid memory numbers on platforms with more than 4GB of RAM.
 Also, polling this MIB has not caused CPU-hogs for the SNMP process.
