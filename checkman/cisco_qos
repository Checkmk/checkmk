description:
 This check monitors the usage of QoS classes on Cisco routers using the information
 provided by the {CISCO-CLASS-BASED-QOS-MIB} SNMP MIB.

 The check creates one service for each interface+class combination.

 The check results in critical/warning states when the there are any packets dropped
 for this class by default. It is possible to set thresholds on the traffic rate in
 this QoS class to raise warnings/criticals when the traffic exceeds a given level.
 The drop thresholds can be customized too.

item:
 A string: A combination of the interface name as set in IF-MIB::ifDescr and the 
 name of the QoS class as given in CISCO-CLASS-BASED-QOS-MIB::cbQosCMName.

inventory:
 For each combination of IF-MIB::ifDescr and CISCO-CLASS-BASED-QOS-MIB::cbQosCMName one
 check is created.

perfdata:
 {post}: The number of outbound bytes after executing the QoS.
 {drop}: The number of dropped bytes.

[parameters]
post_warn (float): The post QoS bytes per second to raise a warning state. Default is None.
post_crit (float): The post QoS bytes per second to raise a critical state. Default is None.
drop_warn (float): The number of dropped bytes per second to raise a warning state. Default is 0.01.
drop_crit (float): The number of dropped bytes per second to raise a critical state. Default is 0.01.

[configuration]
if_default_levels (float, float, float, float): Warning and critical rates for post QoS in bytes/s.
                                                Warning and critical rates for dropped traffic in bytes/s.
                                                Default is {(None, None, 0.01, 0.01)}
