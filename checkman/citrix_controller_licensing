agents: windows

license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the licensing state of Citrix XenApp 7.x controllers.
 The citrix_farm.ps1 plugin must be installed on the controller, and
 the Checkmk agent must be executed with Citrix Admin permissions
 for this to work. The licensing states "ServerNotSpecified", "LicenseNotInstalled",
 "LicenseExpired", "Incompatible", and "Failed" failed are treated as CRIT,
 as are the licensing grace states "InEmergencyGracePeriod" and "GracePeriodExpired".
 The server state "NotConnected" is interpreted as warn, as are the grace states
 "InOutOfBoxGracePeriod" and "InSupplementalGracePeriod".

inventory:
 One service is created for each controller.
