description:
 This check outputs the list of currently active services on a
 Citrix XenApp 7.x controller. The citrix_farm.ps1 plugin must be
 installed on the controller, and the Checkmk agent must be executed
 with Citrix Admin permissions for this to work. This check is purely
 informative and always OK.

discovery:
 One service is created for each controller.
