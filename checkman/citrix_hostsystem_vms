description:
 This checks returns the number of VMs running of Citrix XenApp 7.x hostsystems,
 as well as a list of their names. It is purely informative and always OK.
 The citrix_farm.ps1 plugin must be installed on the controller, and
 the Checkmk agent must be executed with Citrix Admin permissions
 for this to work. Data for the hosts is collected on the controller and
 given to the monitoring server as piggyback data.

discovery:
 One service is created for each controller.
