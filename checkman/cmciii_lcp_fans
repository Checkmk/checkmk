description:
 This check monitors the status and RPM (in precent of maximum RPM)
 of the fans of Rittal CMC-III LCP devices.
 No limits are set in the check, since limits are configured in the
 Rittal device itself. The state given by the Rittal device is
 taken as the state of the check as follows:
 If the Rittal device returns {OK}, the check is {OK}. Otherwise
 the check is {CRIT}.
 Futhermore, the global lower limit for the fan RPM is extracted from
 the device. If the fan RPM is below this limit, the check is {WARN}.

item:
 The number of the fan

inventory:
 One service is created for each fan (6 per device) if their status is not "Off".
