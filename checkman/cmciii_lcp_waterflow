description:
 This check monitors the water flow of Rittal CMC-III LCP devices.
 No limits are set in the check, since limits are configured in the
 Rittal device itself. The state given by the Rittal device is
 taken as the state of the check as follows:
 If the Rittal device returns {OK}, the check is {OK}. Otherwise
 the check is {CRIT}.
 Furthermore, the minimum and maximum flow limits of the device are
 extracted and a state of {WARN} is assumed if the actual flow is
 outside these limits.

inventory:
 One service is created.
