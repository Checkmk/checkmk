description:
 This check monitors the temperature of the outflowing water of
 Rittal CMC-III LCP devices.
 No limits are set in the check, since limits are configured in the
 Rittal device itself. The state given by the Rittal device is
 taken as the state of the check as follows:
 If the Rittal device returns {OK}, the check is {OK}. Otherwise
 the check is {CRIT}.
 Furthermore, the lower and upper warning and critical limits configured
 in the device are extracted and used as limimts for the
 temperature read from the device.
