description:
 This check monitors the temperatures measured by
 Rittal CMC-III Liquid Cooling Package Fanpacks.
 These units have 6 temperature sensors, 3 for inflowing air,
 3 for outflowing air.
 This check handles each of those sensors individually while
 cmciii_lcp_airin and cmciii_lcp_airout handle the temperature
 averages of inflowing and outflowing air respectively.
 Limits are configured in the Rittal device itself but can be
 overridden. The state given by the Rittal device is
 taken as the state of the check as follows:
 If the Rittal device returns {OK}, the check is {OK}. Otherwise
 the check is {CRIT}.

item:
 The unit name and the name of the temperature sensor

discovery:
 One service is created for each temperature sensor on all cmciii lcp fanpack units.
