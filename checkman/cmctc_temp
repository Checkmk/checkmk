description:
 This check polls the state of temperature sensors
 attached to a ComputerMultiControl-TopConcept unit.
 Per default warning and critical levels are read via SNMP and
 need to be configured in Check_Mk. Configure them
 in your CMC unit. It is also possible to configure
 levels. That way the state and levels from the SNMP
 output are being ignored.

item:
 Combination of IO unit number (3-6) and sensors index (1-4).
 Example: {"3.2"} for first IO unit and second sensor.

inventory:
 One service is created for each available temperature sensor.
