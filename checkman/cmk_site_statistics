description:
 This check monitors the number of hosts and services of Checkmk sites. It
 reports the total number of hosts, the number of hosts which are not UP as
 well as metrics recording the number of hosts which are UP, DOWN, in
 downtime and unreachable.

 Similarly, for services, the plugin reports the total number of services,
 the number of services which are not OK and metrics recording the number
 of services which are OK, in downtime, on down hosts, WARNING, UNKNOWN and
 CRITICAL.

 The check is always OK and not user-configurable.

item:
 The name of the Checkmk site.

inventory:
 One service is created for each running Checkmk site on a Checkmk server.

cluster:
 On a cluster we aggregate over all node results -- but we
 expect to only get data from the active node.
 Note that the plugin will not warn you if more than one
 node sends data.
