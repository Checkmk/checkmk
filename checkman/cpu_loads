description:
 This check measures the 1-, 5- and 15-minute-averages of the CPU
 load. Additionally, the 15-minute-average is checked against user-
 configurable levels.

 Note: The CPU load is the average number of processes that are
 currently in the state "running". Do not mix this up with the
 CPU "utiliziation" (which measures the current usage of the CPU
 in percent).

discovery:
 One service is created per host.
