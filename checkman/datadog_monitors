description:
 This check monitors Datadog monitors collected by the Datadog special
 agent. The monitoring state in Checkmk depends on the state of the
 monitor as reported by the Datadog API.

 By default, "Ok" and "No Data" are mapped to OK. "Warn" and "Alert" mapped
 to WARN and CRIT. All other states are mapped to UNKN. This can be changed
 using the ruleset "Checking of Datadog monitors", where you can also
 configure Datadog tags to be reported in the service output.

 Furthermore, using the ruleset "Discovery of Datadog monitors", you can
 exclude monitors from being discovered, based on their state as reported by
 the Datadog API. By default, all monitors collected by the special agent
 are discovered.

discovery:
 One service is created per monitor.

item:
 The name of the monitor.
