description:
 This check monitors various performance values of
 a DECRU NAS without setting any levels. The check
 is always OK and is used for measuring only.

 Please note, that - unfortunately - the DECRU MIB does
 not provide counters (as would be the usual approach) but
 only current values. That way you will just get one current
 value every check interval and will get no information about
 the intervening time.

item:
 The number of the counter, followed by a colon followed by a
 description of the counter.

inventory:
 One service is created for each counter.
