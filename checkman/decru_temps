description:
 This check monitors the temperature of the various temperature
 sensors of a DECRU NAS appliance. Since the appliance does not
 supply levels in the MIB and the levels depend on the exact
 product type, we guess sensible parameters during inventury
 by adding 4 or 8 degrees (celsius) to the current temperature
 in order to obtain levels for warning and critical. You can
 override those values by defining the checks manually.

item:
 The name of the temperature sensor as defined in the SNMP data.

inventory:
 One service is created for each sensor.
