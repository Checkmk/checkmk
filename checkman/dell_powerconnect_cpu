title: Dell PowerConnect Switches: CPU Load

description:
 This check monitors the CPU load on Dell PowerConnect Switches which support the
 RADWARE-MIB. It will check the percentage of the CPU load for the following states:

 - 1 second (the load average of when the check ran).

 - 60 seconds (the "average" over the last 60 seconds at the time the check occurred).

 - 5 minutes (the "average" over the last 5 minutes, at the time the check occurred).

 A single service will be created showing the percentage of CPU use at the time
 the check occurred (using the 1 second load average).  However, charts are created
 for each of the load averages, using values obtained during each execution of the
 service check.

 The state of the check will return a WARNING value when the percentage of the 1 second
 load value exceeds the warning threshold, and is less then the critical threshold. If the
 load values exceeds the critical threshold, then it will return a CRITICAL state.

 Currently, testing has been completed with the Dell PowerConnect 5448 and 5424 models,
 however the service check may work with other models.

inventory:
 One service is created for the CPU if the MIB defined above is supported on the switch.
