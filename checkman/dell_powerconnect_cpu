title: Dell PowerConnect Switches: CPU load
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/network/dell
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the CPU load on Dell PowerConnect Switches which support the
 RADWARE-MIB. It will check the percentage of the CPU load for the following states:

  - 1 second (the load average of when the check ran).
  - 60 seconds (the "average" over the last 60 seconds at the time the check occurred).
  - 5 minutes (the "average" over the last 5 minutes, at the time the check occurred).

 A single service will be created showing the percentage of CPU use at the time
 the check occurred (using the 1 second load average).  However, charts are created
 for each of the load averages, using values obtained during each execution of the
 service check.

 The state of the check will return a WARNING value when the percentage of the 1 second
 load value exceeds the warning threshold, and is less then the critical threshold. If the
 load values exceeds the critical threshold, then it will return a CRITICAL state.

 Currently, testing has been completed with the Dell PowerConnect 5448 and 5424 models,
 however the service check may work with other models.

examples:
 It is possible to over-ride the default WARNING and CRITICAL threshold values
 defined above, by ensuring the following variable configuration is set in
 your local main.mk file.

 # Indicate warning at 50% CPU load, and indicate critical for 60%
 dell_powerconnect_cpu_default_levels = (50, 60)

perfdata:
 Each chart uses a single variable, the CPU percentage (0..100) representing
 the state of the load average at the time the check occurred.

inventory:
 During the inventory phase of check_mk, it will identify one service {CPU},
 as long as the MIB defined above is supported on the switch.

[parameters]
warning (int): The CPU utilization percentage at which a warning state is triggered.
critical (int): The CPU utilization percentage at which a critical state is triggered.

[configuration]
dell_powerconnect_cpu_default_levels(int, int): The Default percentage values used by the inventory checks.
 These variables are pre-set to {(80, 90)}.
