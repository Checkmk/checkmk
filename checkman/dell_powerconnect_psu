description:
 This check monitors the various PSU sensors on a Dell PowerConnect switch that supports
 the DELL-VENDOR-MIB. It will monitor the state of the PSU itself, depending on the
 state returned by the PSU.

 If a switch has more then one PSU sensor, it will create a service for EACH sensor.
 However, if a switch has any PSU units that are not connected up to the sensor suite, or
 there is an empty PSU bay, they will not be ignored by this check.

 A PSU that is running normally will return an OK nagios state. Any PSU that
 are in a warning or is not present (if it was previously present) will return a WARNING
 nagios state. If a PSU is in a critical or is non-functional according to the sensor will
 return a CRITICAL nagios state. Lastly, if a PSU is in a "shutdown" state, it will return
 an UNKNOWN nagios state.

 The service will show the state of the PSU, as well as the power source state. The source
 of the power can be one of the following:

 - Unknown

 - Alternating Current

 - Direct Current

 - External Power Supply

 - Internal Redundant

 Currently, testing has been completed with the Dell PowerConnect 5448 and 5424 models,
 however the service check may work with other models.

inventory:
 One service is created for each power supply if the MIB
 defined above is supported on the switch.

item:
 The Name of the power supply

example:
 If a switch has 2 PSU devices in the device, it may create one service for each PSU, or a single
 service that indicates the PSU devices are connected internally, in a redundant state. The
 result is strictly determined in what the SNMP service provides to the check.

 The psX value represents the selected PSU, where as the unitX values represents the sensor
 assigned to the PSU. It is possible to have multiple sensors on a single PSU, though I have
 yet to see one.
