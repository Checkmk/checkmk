description:
 This check monitors the current of power units of Dell PowerEdge Servers.

 The state given by the device is taken as the state of the check as follows:
 If the device returns {OK}, the check is {OK}. If the device returns {other},
 {unknown}, {nonCriticalUpper} and {nonCriticalLower} a state of {WARN} is
 returned. Otherwise the check is {CRIT}.

 Limits are configured in the device itself. The check displays the upper warning
 and critical limits as configured in the device. Further limits are {not} displayed,
 even though they may be configured. These are UpperNonRecoverable, LowerCritical,
 LowerNonCritical and LowerNonRecoverable. These limits yet may lead to state changes,
 the corresponding states are honoured as outlined above.
