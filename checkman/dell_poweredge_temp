description:
 This check monitors the temperature of Dell PowerEdge Servers by probing and
 monitoring known temperature sensors on the device. Measured temperatures
 may include CPU temperatures as well as air inlet temperatures and others,
 depending on the device configuration.

 No limits are set in the check, since limits are configured in the device
 itself. The state given by the device is taken as the state of the check
 as follows: If the device returns {OK}, the check is {OK}. If the device returns
 {other}, {unknown}, {nonCriticalUpper} and {nonCriticalLower} a state of {WARN}
 is returned. Otherwise the check is {CRIT}.

 The check displays the upper warning and critical limits as configured in the device.
 Further limits are {not} displayed, even though they may be configured. These are
 UpperNonRecoverable, LowerCritical, LowerNonCritical and LowerNonRecoverable.
 These limits yet may lead to state changes, the corresponding states are honoured
 as outlined above.

item:
 Either the name of the location variable configured for the temperature sensor, or
 the chassis index and sensor index seperated by a dash.

perfdata:
 One variable: the temperature

inventory:
 All temperature sensors which do not have the state settings unknown are detected
