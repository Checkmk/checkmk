title: NetApp Filer: Used Space in Filesystem Using 32-Bit Counters
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/storagehw/netapp

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check measures the usage of aggregates and volumes in a NetAPP filer.
 As opposed to the check {df_netapp} this one is using {32bit counters}
 which might overflow and give negative results!
 Please use {df_netapp} instead of {df_netapp32} if your OnTAP version and
 SNMP configuration supports it.

 The usage is checked against a warning and a critical level.
 If a snapshot reserve is configured, snapshot growth will affect
 the volume usage just like normal data.
 Snapshots will also be listed, if their size is non-zero.

 As of version {1.1.9i9} Checkmk supports {trends}. This means that
 the {df} check is now able to compute the {change} of the used space
 over the time and can make a forecast into the future. It can estimate
 the point of time where the filesystem will be full.

 In the default configuration the check will compute the trend based on the
 data of the last 24 hours. Similar like the CPU load this is done with
 a logarithmic average that weights the more recent time more than time
 farer away. Also data beyond the 24 hours will to some small degree be
 reflected in the computation. The advantage of this algorithm is a more
 precise prediction and a simpler implementation, which does not need any
 access to any RRDs or similar storage.

 Please note, that when a volume is started being monitored, then
 the trend of the past is unknown and will be assumed to be {zero}. That means
 that it will take at least one trend range of time until the trend approximately
 reflects the reality.

item:
 The name of the aggregate or volume on the NetAPP filer.

inventory:
 One service is created for each filesystem
 the agent reports except mount points listed in
 {inventory_df_exclude_mountpoints} and filesystem types
 listed in {inventory_df_exclude_fs}. The Windows agent
 only reports fixed disks. The Linux agent reports filesystems
 that have a size and are not of type smbfs, tmpfs, cifs or nfs.
