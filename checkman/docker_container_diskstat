title: Docker: Container Disk Throughput

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check measures the throughput of block devices (disks) of docker
 containers. You can either have a single check for every single disk or a
 summary check (which is the default) summing up the throughput of all disks.

item:
 Either {"SUMMARY"} for a summarized check of all disks or the name of the
 disk device, e.g. {"sda"}.

discovery:
  One service is created for each disk if the configuration is set to {"single"}.
  If the configuration is set to {"summary"} one service is created for each host.
  If set to {"legacy"} then two services one for read and one for write
  is created (deprecated).
  The inventory is configured via {diskstat_inventory_mode}.
