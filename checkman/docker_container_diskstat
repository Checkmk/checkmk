description:
 This check measures the throughput of block devices (disks) of docker
 containers. You can either have a single check for every single disk or a
 summary check (which is the default) summing up the throughput of all disks.

 This check measures the memory usage of a docker container respecting
 either the memory limits of the docker node or the limit configured
 for the container.

 Use the "Main memory usage (UNIX / Other Devices)" rule set to configure
 thresholds on the memory usage.

item:
 Either {"SUMMARY"} for a summarized check of all disks or the name of the
 disk device, e.g. {"sda"}.
