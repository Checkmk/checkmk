title: Docker: Container Labels
agents: linux
catalog: containerization/docker
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 The check plugin creates host labels based on the Docker labels of the containers.
 The labels imported from Docker are prefixed with "docker/" in CheckMK.

 To make this check work the agent plugin {{mk_docker.py}} has to be installed.
 If you are using agent bakery rules, you must enable "Piggybacked docker containers".
 If you are configuring the plugin via the configuration file, make sure you do not skip the
 section "docker_containers_client" (the default setting is fine).

inventory:
 No service check is created.
