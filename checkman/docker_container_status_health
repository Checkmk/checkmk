title: Docker: Container Health
agents: linux
catalog: containerization/docker
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 Monitors the health status of docker containers, as reported via
 the HEALTHCHECK API. A Status of "healthy" is treated as OK,
 "starting" as WARN, "unhealthy" as CRIT.
 The Plugin additionally displays the last reported output of the health test
 and the configured health test command itself.

 To make this check work the agent plugin {{mk_docker.py}} has to be installed.
 If you are using agent bakery rules, you must enable "Piggybacked docker containers".
 If you are configuring the plugin via the configuration file, make sure you do not skip the
 section "docker_container_status" (the default setting is fine).

inventory:
 One service is created for each active container (running or exited or restart policy 'always')
 that has a health test configured.
