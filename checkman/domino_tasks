title: Count of Lotus Domino Tasks
agents: snmp
catalog: all/lotusnotes
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses snmp to extract the list of currently running tasks
 on IBMs Lotus Domino Servers. It monitors the number of tasks
 matching a certain name or regular expression and checks it against
 warning and critical upper and lower levels.

item:
 A user definable service description.  The description must be unique
 within each host.  Changing the description will make Nagios think that it
 is another service.

inventory:
 Since Check_MK cannot know which tasks should be monitored, an inventory
 needs some configuration. The configuration is done via {inv_domino_tasks}.
 The structure of this variable is a list of seven-tuples. It is similar but not
 completely the same as the configuration of manual checks. The seven
 components of each entry are: {(1)} a service description, {(2)} a pattern
 (just as the first parameter of the check), {(3)} the boolean value {None}
 and {(4)} - {(7)} the warning and critical levels for the number of processes.

 During inventory Check_MK tries to match all entries on each
 process found on the target host. If an entry matches, a new check will
 be created according to the entry (if it's not already existing).

 The {service description} may contain one or more occurances of {%s}. In this
 case, the pattern must be a regular expression prefixed with ~. For each
 {%s} in the description, the expression has to contain one "group". A group
 is a subexpression enclosed in brackets, for example {(.*)} or
 {([a-zA-Z]+)} or {(...)}. When the inventory finds a task
 matching the pattern, it will substitute all such groups with the actual values when
 creating the check. In this way one rule can create several checks on a host.

 If the pattern contains more groups than occurrences of {%s} in the service
 description, only the first matching subexpressions are used for the service
 descriptions. The matched substrings corresponding to the remaining groups
 are nevertheless copied into the regular expression.

 As an alternative to {%s} you may also use {%1}, {%2}, etc.
 These expressions will be replaced by the first, second, ... matching group, allowing
 you to reorder things.

 Wildcards not enclosed by brackets are simply copied verbatim to the created
 checks. Please refer to the examples for more details.

 The {user specification} must be the boolean value {None} because the check
 uses the inventory function of the {ps} check, where this key is required.

 The {warning and critical levels} are simply copied to the created
 checks.

 Inventory allows optional host specification.  You can prepend a list of
 host names or a list of tag names and {ALL_HOSTS} to some of all rules of
 the inventory specification. That way you can make the inventory apply some
 rules only to certain hosts.

examples:
 # Examples for manually configured checks
 checks += [
   # make sure 6 Router tasks are running
   ( 'somehost', 'domino_tasks', 'Router', {
                                'process': 'Router',
                                'warnmin': 1,
                                'warnmax': 1,
                                'okmin': 1
                                'okmax': 1,
   }),

   # the same, but  for all hosts with the tag "lnx"
   ( ["lnx"], ALL_HOSTS, "domino_tasks", "Router", {
                                'process': 'Router',
                                'warnmin': 1,
                                'warnmax': 1,
                                'okmin': 1
                                'okmax': 1,
