title: IBM Lotus Domino: Count of Tasks
agents: snmp
catalog: app/lotusnotes
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses snmp to extract the list of currently running tasks
 on IBMs Lotus Domino Servers. It monitors the number of tasks
 matching a certain name or regular expression and checks it against
 warning and critical upper and lower levels.

item:
 A user definable service description.  The description must be unique
 within each host.  Changing the description will make Nagios think that it
 is another service.

inventory:
 Since Checkmk cannot know which tasks should be monitored, an inventory
 needs some configuration. The configuration is done via {inv_domino_tasks_rules}.

 During inventory Checkmk tries to match all entries on each
 process found on the target host. If an entry matches, a new check will
 be created according to the entry (if it's not already existing).
