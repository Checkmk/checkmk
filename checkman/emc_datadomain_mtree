 from the state reported by the device as follows:
 The check is {OK} if the system reports {3} (readWrite), {4} (replicationDestination)
 {5} (retentionLockEnabled), {6} (retentionLockDisabled). The check is {WARN}
 if the MTree reports a state of {1} (readOnly). The check is {CRIT} if the Mtree
 reports a state of {1} (deleted).

 This behavior can be modified using the rule "State of EMC Data Domain MTree".
