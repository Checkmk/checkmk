description:

 This check measures the throughput of the VPLEX Directors.
 You can either have a single check for every single director
 or a summary check (which is the default) summing up the throughput
 of all directors.

 The check also gives info on the IO latency and IOPS aquired.

 You can apply separate warning and critical levels for the read
 and write throughput. Optionally you can have the check compute
 average values on a configurable time period and have the levels
 applied on the average instead of the current values. This makes
 it possible to ignore short "peaks" and only trigger and longer
 phases of high disk activity.

 Averaging is not applied to IO latency calculations.

 Note: It seems that the relevant SNMP data of the EMC VPLEX System
 is only updated every 90 seconds. You should set the monitoring interval
 to 120 seconds, otherwise there will be errors in the calucation of the rates
 for read/write throughput and ios.

item:
 Either {"SUMMARY"} for a summarized check of all disks or the name of the
 disk device, e.g. {"director-1-1-A"}.

discovery:
  One service is created for all directors if the configuration
  is set to {["summary"]} (default).
  If the configuration is set to {["physical"]} one service is created
  for each director.
  You can also set {["summary", "physical"]} to create both variants.
  The configuration is set via the {diskstat_inventory} rule.
