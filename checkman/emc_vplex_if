description:
 This check monitors the traffic of the EMC VPLEX frontend and backend
 interfaces. Port up/down detection is not supported.

 You can configure limits for the in- and outgoing traffic.
 This check supports the averaging of the in- and outgoing traffic.

item:
 There are three ways to specify the interface: {1}: the index number
 which is determined by the check, the interface description, e.g. {B1-FC00} or
 the alias, which is a combination of the director name an the description, e.g {director-1-1-A A1-FC03}

inventory:
 The inventory creates one service for each port

perfdata:
 {in}: The number of bytes received per second.

 {out}: The number of bytes sent per second.

 {in_avg_?}: optional: The averaged number of received bytes over a longer range of time

 {out_avg_?}: optional: The averaged number of sent bytes
