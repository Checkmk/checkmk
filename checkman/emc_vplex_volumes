description:

 This check measures the throughput of the EMC VPLEX volumes.
 You can either have a single check for every single volume
 or a summary check (which is the default) summing up the throughput
 of all volumes.

 The check also gives info on the IO Operations per seconds.

 You can apply separate warning and critical levels for the read
 and write throughput. Optionally you can have the check compute
 average values on a configurable time period and have the levels
 applied on the average instead of the current values. This makes
 it possible to ignore short "peaks" and only trigger and longer
 phases of high disk activity.

 Note: It seems that the relevant SNMP data of the EMC VPLEX System
 is only updated every 90 seconds. You should set the monitoring interval
 to 120 seconds, otherwise there will be errors in the calucation of the rates
 for read/write throughput and IOs.

item:
 Either {"SUMMARY"} for a summarized check of all disks or the name of the
 disk device, e.g. {"VPZ-B-S-L323_vol"}.

inventory:
  The inventory is configured via the {diskstat_inventory} rule. If this is set
  to {["summary"]} (the default), then one check will be created for all volumes.
  If it is set to {["physical"]} then one check will be created per volume.
  You can also set {["summary", "physical"]} to create both variants.

perfdata:
  The volumes throughput for read and write in bytes per second. If averaging
  is turned on, then two additional values are sent: the averaged read and
  write throughput.

  The volumes write and write latency and the operations per second.
