description:
 Reports the status and the I/O rate of a disk in an EMC VNX storage system.

 Returns {OK} if the state of a disk is "Unbound" or "Hot Spare Ready" or
 "Enabled" or "Ready", the number of Hard Read Errors is 0 and the number
 of Hard Write Errors is 0.

 Returns {WARN} if the state of a disk is "Rebuilding", the number of Hard
 Read Errors is 0 and the number of Hard Write Errors is 0.

 {CRIT} is returned otherwise.

 I/O rates (in Bytes/sec) are just informational and do not trigger any state
 other than {OK}

 The information is retriefed by the special agent agent_emcvnx which uses
 EMC's command line tool naviseccli.

 If you always get Read: 0.00B/s, Write: 0.00B/s and you think this are not
 the correct values, please note: Reporting of these data must be turned on
 at the storage by a command like {setstats -on}
item:
 Consists of bus ID, enclosure ID and disk ID as returned by the agent.
 E. g. "1/1 Disk 9"

discovery:
 One service is created for each disk listed in the agent output.
