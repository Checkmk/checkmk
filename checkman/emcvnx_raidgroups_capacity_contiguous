title: EMC VNX Storage: Contiguous Free Capacity in RAID Groups
agents: emcvnx
catalog: hw/storagehw/emc

distribution: check_mk
description:
 Checks the Usage of RAID Groups in an EMC VNX storage system. In contrast to
 the Check {emcvnx_raidgroups.capacity} this check rates only the biggest
 free contiguous group of unbound segments as "free". Fragmented space is
 rated as used.

 The Check uses the check logic of the {df} check, so for configuration parameters
 and examples please refer to the man page of {df}.

 The information is retriefed by the special agent agent_emcvnx which uses
 EMC's command line tool naviseccli. Capacity is retriefed in blocks. For
 calculation of size in MB the check assumes a blocksize of 512 Bytes.

item:
 The RAID Group ID.

discovery:
 One service is created for each RAID Group listed in the agent output.
