agents: vsphere

description:
 This check monitors performance counters of network interfaces via the vSphere API.
 The check is fully compatible with {if64} with the exception that the queue length
 is not reported. See the {if64}-manpage for details.

item:
 There are three allowed ways to specify an interface: its index, which simply
 enumerates the interfaces, its description and its alias. For this check, the
 description and the alias are the same.

discovery:
 One service is created for each interface that fulfills configurable conditions
 (rule "Network interface and switch port discovery").
 By default, these are interfaces which are currently found {up} and are of type 6, 32,
 62, 117, 127, 128, 129, 180, 181, 182, 205 or 229. Note that for this check, all
 discovered interfaces are of type 6.

 {Grouping:} In some situations, you do not want to monitor a single
 interface but a group of interfaces that together form a pool.
 This check supports such pools by defining groups. The data of all members is
 accumulated and put together in a single grouped interface service.
