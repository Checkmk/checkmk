description:
 This check uses the output of the vsphere special agent in order to
 monitor the used space in datastores. It also displays this amount
 of (over) provisioning.

 This check is 100% compatible with normal filesystem check in all respects.
 Please refer to the manpage of {df} for details - except for the support for
 filesystem grouping.

item:
 The logical name of the filesystem (not the mountpoint!)

inventory:
 One service is created for each datastore.
