description:
 This check measures the averaged CPU utilization for a cluster of ESX Host systems.
 You can configure multiple WARN/CRIT levels depending on the number of nodes in this cluster.
 This check is only applicable for clusters and cannot be inventorized.
 You need to create a manual check for it in WATO and assign it to a cluster host.
