description:
 This check checks the state of all of a VMWare ESX host system's
 hardware sensors - including temperatures, fans, power supplies, memory DIMMS,
 hard disk, an others. In order to avoid network traffic the agent sends
 only information about sensors that are not in green state.

 Note: Due to a caching problem on the ESX host system side, this check
 occasionally reports incorrect sensor data. This may mean that the
 sensor appears to be stuck in an unhealthy state. You can find more

  One service is created for each ESX Host System.
