description:
 For a virtual machine running on ESX this check reports the heartbeat
 status (queried from vsphere agent)

 This check returns:

 {OK} if the guest operating system is responding normally
      (vsphere state: green)

 {WARN} on intermittent heartbeat. May be due to guest load.
      (vsphere state: yellow)
      or if VMware Tools are not installed or not running.
      (vsphere state: gray)

 {CRIT} if there is no heartbeat. Guest operating system may have stopped responding.
      (vsphere state: red)
