distribution: check_mk
description:
 The check queries the MIB tables of F5 BIG-IP loadbalancers (local traffic managers) to identify
 if all system configs are in-sync when running a load balancing cluster.
 It will issue a warning if one of the nodes is out of sync, or a critical on one of the two following conditions:

 - both nodes have differing configs

 - the node being checked has the status "unconfigured"

 It supports devices running the 9.0 and above releases of the F5 OS, but lower then 11. It's tested against 9.3
 devices.

inventory:
  One service is created for the cluster status
  unless the load balancer config sync is in a status of "unconfigured".
