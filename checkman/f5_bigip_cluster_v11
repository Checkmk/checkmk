distribution: check_mk
description:
 The check queries the MIB tables of F5 BIG-IP loadbalancers (local traffic managers) to identify
 if all system configs are in-sync when running a load balancing cluster.
 It will issue a warning if one of the nodes is out of sync, or a critical on one of the two following conditions:

     - both nodes have differing configs

     - the node being checked has the status "unconfigured"

 It supports devices running the 11 and above releases of the F5 OS.

inventory:
  One service is created for the cluster status
  unless the load balancer config sync is in a status of "unconfigured".
