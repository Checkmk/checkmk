title: F5 Big-IP: Load Balancing Pools

description:
 The check queries the MIB tables of F5 BIG-IP loadbalancers (local traffic
 managers) for the status of any load balancing pools. It gathers the number
 of loadbalancers backing the pool and how many of those are working. It
 doesn't currently honor the 'MinUpMembers' parameter that can be set to
 trigger actions for the pool if too many members fail.

 It supports devices running the 9.0 and above releases of the F5 OS. It's
 tested against 9.3 devices.

 If there are down or disabled nodes, the names of the nodes are
 also printed in the service output. They are identified using the
 following oids: ltmPoolMemberMonitorState, ltmPoolMemberMonitorStatus,
 ltmPoolMemberSessionStatus

item:
 Name of the pool

discovery:
 One service is created for each pool defined on a system,
 even if the pool is not enabled, as this is considered a temporary state.
