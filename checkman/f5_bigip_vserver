description:
 The check queries the MIB tables of F5 BIG-IP load balancers (local traffic
 managers) for the status of any virtual server defined on them. It supports
 devices running the 9.0 and above releases of the F5 OS. It's tested against
 9.3 devices.

 There is one special handling in the check. If the vserver is not available
 and all its children pool members are down the check reports {OK}.

 All states are configurable. Default values are
 OK (is up and available, the children pool member(s) are down if VServer is not available),
 WARN (is disabled, availability unknown),
 CRIT (is currently not available, is not available),
 UNKNOWN (is unlicensed).

item:
 Name of virtual server

inventory:
 Any virtual server that is found online will be added during inventory
 and checked for it's status. Virtual servers in the various "Warning"
 states will not be inventorized. Vserver of state green and blue will be
 inventorized.
