title: Age and Size of Files
agents: windows, linux, freebsd, macosx, solaris, aix
catalog: os/files
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the size and age of specific files
 in the target host's filesystem.
 You can set lower and upper
 limits on both the modification time and the size of
 a file. When the file is missing then the check will
 go {UNKNOWN}.

 This check needs some configuration in the agent,
 as the agent needs to know the information about
 which files need to be sent.

 Currently Windows, Linux, FREEBSD, MACOSX and Solaris
 agents supports this type of check.

 For windows, the configuration is done in {check_mk.ini} in
 the section {[fileinfo]}. Put one or more entries of the
 format {path = C:\Some Dir\*.log} into this
 section. The agent will send all files that match
 the pattern.

 For Linux, FREEBSD, MACOSX and Solaris the configuration
 is done via {fileinfo.cfg} located in the {$MK_CONFDIR}
 (usually {/etc/check_mk/fileinfo.cfg}). To add files to
 the check, simply add one path pattern {/tmp/*.log} per line.

 Globbing patterns are used to filter the files, e.g. {/var/*/*}.

item:
 The complete path name of the file is sent by
 the agent (this is case sensitive even when monitoring
 Windows).

 Please note: when referring to the item in {check_parameters},
 make sure that backslashes (contained in Windows paths) are
 properly quoted. You need one escape level for the Python
 string and one for the regular expression. If you prefix the
 Python string with a {r}, then just the regular expression
 needs its double backslash (see examples). Without the {r} you
 would need four backslashes in a row in order to denote one
 backslash in the file's path.

discovery:
 One service is created for each file that the agent sends.
