agents: windows, linux, freebsd, macosx, solaris, aix
catalog: os/files
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the size, age and count of specific
 files in the target host's filesystem.
 You can set lower and upper limits on the count, the
 modification time and the size of a file.

 This check needs some configuration in the agent,
 as the agent needs to know the information about
 which files need to be sent.

 The required python plugin mk_filestats is configured
 via {filestats.cfg} located in the {$MK_CONFDIR}
 (usually {/etc/check_mk/filestats.cfg}).
 To add file groups to the check, add one
 configuration section to the file.

 Note that the informational depth of the received data
 depends on the choosen output option.

 For an extensive documentation of the available options,
 please refer to "mk_filestats.py --help".

item:
 One item is created per configured section using the
 'file_stats' output, with the sections name as item.

inventory:
 One service is created for each section that the agent sends.
