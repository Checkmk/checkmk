 This check monitors the reported status of one of a physical disk
 in storage systems from Fujitsu which support the
 FJDARY-E100.MIB like the ETERNUS DX80 S2.
 This is an adaption of the corresponding fjdarye60 check.

 The check goes CRIT if the current state is not equal the state
 during discovery; otherwise OK.
 Moreover you can configure using the device states. In this case
 the expected state is ignored and the check status will be CRIT
 if the disk is broken, WARN if it is not available, not supported,
 readying, recovering, partbroken, spare, notexist or copying,
 OK otherise.

item:
 The index of the device enclosure in the SNMP table. It is of type
 integer. The first module has an index of {0}.

 One service is created for each disk
 if the state is not {notavailable} (3).
