description:
 This check monitors the reported summary status of all installed
 physical disks
 in storage systems from Fujitsu which support the
 FJDARY-E101.MIB.
 This is an adaption of the corresponding fjdarye60 check.

 The check goes CRIT if the current state is not equal the state
 during discovery; otherwise OK.
 Moreover you can configure using the device states. In this case
 the expected state is ignored and the check status will be CRIT
 if one disk is broken, WARN if one is not available, not supported,
 readying, recovering, partbroken, spare, notexist or copying,
 OK otherise.

inventory:
 One summary service is created if at least one disk is found.
