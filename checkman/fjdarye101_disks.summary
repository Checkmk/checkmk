description:
 This check monitors the reported summary status of all installed
 physical disks
 in storage systems from Fujitsu which support the
 FJDARY-E101.MIB. 
 This is an adaption of the corresponding fjdarye60 check.

item:
 {None}

inventory:
 If at least one disk is found, exactly one check will be created for
 the host.

examples:
 # Expect 5 available(=online) and one spare disk
 checks += [
   ( 'arc', 'fjdarye100_disks.summary', None, { "available": 5, "spare": 1 } )
 ]

[parameters]
expected_state (dictionary): A dictionary from the statenames to the number
 of disks expected in that state. Possible state names are:
 {"available"}, {"broken"}, {"notavailable"}, {"notsupported"},{"present"},
 {"readying"}, {"recovering"}, {"partbroken"}, {"spare"}, {"formating"},
 {"unformated"}, {"notexist"}, {"copying"}. The check will report {CRITICAL}
 if there are not enough disks in at least one state or otherwise {WARNING} if at
 least one state has an exceeding number of disks.
