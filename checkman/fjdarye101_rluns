description:
 This check monitors the state of an RLUN in
 a storage system from Fujitsu that support the
 FJDARY-E101-MIB.

 Note: Unfortunately the MIB does not provide any information
 about the exact meanings of the state objects of the RLUNs
 (hex dumps). Follwing assumptions have been made based on some
 simple Tests: {A0} in byte 4 means "present", {08} in byte 3
 means "rebuilding", {07} in byte 3 means "copyback", {41} in
 byte 3 means "spare is in use" and {00} in byte 3 means "normal state".
 Please mail me, if you have more profound information...

 This is an adaption of the corresponding fjdarye60 check.

item:
 The index of the RLUN in the SNMP table (integer). The first RLUN usually
 has index {1}.

inventory:
 One service is created for each present RLUN.
