description:
 This check monitors the reported status of all installed inlet thermal
 sensors in storage systems from Fujitsu Siemens which support the
 FJDARY-E60.MIB like the ETERNUS DX60 and DX80.

item:
 The index of the inlet thermal sensor in the SNMP table. It is of type
 integer. The first module has an index of {0}.

inventory:
 The check supports automatic inventory. All available items which have
 a state other than {invalid} (4) during the inventory run are added to the
 configuration. The {invalid} state is excluded because it means that some
 inlet thermal sensor is not installed.
