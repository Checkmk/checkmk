description:
 This check monitors the state of an RLUN in
 a storage system from Fujitsu that support the
 FJDARY-E60-MIB like the ETERNUS DX60 and DX80.

 Note: Unfortunately the MIB does not provide any information
 about the exact meanings of the state objects of the RLUNs
 (hex dumps). The assumption, that {A0} in byte 3 means "present",
 {08} in byte 4 means "rebuilding" and {00} in byte 4 means "OK"
 is based on some simple tests. Please mail me, if you have more
 profound information...

item:
 The index of the RLUN in the SNMP table (integer). The first RLUN usually
 has index {1}.

inventory:
 All RLUNs with byte 3 being {A0} (assumed to mean "present") are inventorized.
