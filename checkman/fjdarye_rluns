description:
 This check monitors the state of an RLUN in
 a storage system from Fujitsu.
 Supported devices:
 ETERNUS DX60
 ETERNUS DX80
 ETERNUS DX80 S2

 Note: Unfortunately the MIB does not provide any information
 about the exact meanings of the state objects of the RLUNs
 (hex dumps). Following assumptions have been made based on some
 simple Tests: {A0} in byte 4 means "present", {08} in byte 3
 means "rebuilding", {07} in byte 3 means "copyback", {41} in
 byte 3 means "spare is in use" and {00} in byte 3 means "normal state".


item:
 The index of the RLUN in the SNMP table (integer). The first RLUN usually
 has index {1}.

discovery:
 One service is created for each present RLUN.
