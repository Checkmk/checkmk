description:
 This check monitors cpu utilization of individual nodes in a FortiGate High-Availability cluster.

 It is preferable to monitor the nodes directly as separate hosts in check_mk as this check only
 provides rudimentary information but if the nodes are not reachable from the monitoring system,
 this is better than nothing.

 Please note: The data reported here does not match exactly the global data reported by the
 fortigate_cpu(_base) check.

item:
 Hostname of the node

inventory:
 One service is created for each node.
