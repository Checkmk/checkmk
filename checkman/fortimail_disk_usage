distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the disk usage of Fortinet FortiMail servers
 and goes {WARN} or {CRIT} if the usage is too high. The default
 thresholds are 80% and 90% usage. They can be changed via the ruleset
 "Fortinet FortiMail disk usage" (this check does not use the common
 functionality for checking disks and filesystems because the device
 does not provide sufficient information).

discovery:
 One check per host will be created.
