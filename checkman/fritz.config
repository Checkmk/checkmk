description:
 The check is always OK, it outputs information about the current DNS-Servers
 and wether or not configuration via uPnP is enabled.

 The check uses data provided by the fritzbox special agent. You need to
 configure this agent to be used for the Fritz!Box you like to monitor. The
 special agent uses uPnP to get the needed information from the device.

inventory:
 One check per system is created if the agent has a section {<<<fritz>>>} and
 at least the key {NewDNSServer1} is provided in this section.
