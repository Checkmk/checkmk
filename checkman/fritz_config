 The check uses data provided by the fritzbox special agent. You need to
 configure this agent to be used for the Fritz!Box you like to monitor. The
 special agent uses uPnP to get the needed information from the device.

 One service is created for each system
 if the agent has a section {<<<fritz>>>} and
 at least the key {NewDNSServer1} is provided in this section.
