description:
 The check is always OK, it outputs information about the network link
 connected to the Fritz!Box. It outputs the {Link Status}, {Physical Link Status}.
 {Link Type} and {WAN Access Type} if those information are provided.

 The check uses data provided by the fritzbox special agent. You need to
 configure this agent to be used for the Fritz!Box you like to monitor. The
 special agent uses uPnP to get the needed information from the device.

inventory:
 One service is created for each system
 if the agent has a section {<<<fritz>>>} and
 at least the keys {NewLinkStatus} and {NewPhysicalLinkStatus} are provided in this section.
