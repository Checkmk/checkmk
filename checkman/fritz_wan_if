description:
 This check monitors the operational status, link speed and traffic of a
 Fritz!Box WAN interface. The check is fully compatible with {if64}, please see
 the corresponding manpage for details.

 The check uses data provided by the fritzbox special agent. You need to
 configure this agent to be used for the Fritz!Box you would like to monitor.
 The special agent uses uPnP to get the needed information from the device.

item:
 There are three allowed ways to specify an interface: its index, its description and
 its alias. For this check, the index is always 0 and the description and the alias
 are always 'WAN'.

inventory:
 In general, the discovery of network interfaces can be configured using the rule
 "Network interface and switch port discovery". By default, only interfaces which are
 currently found {up} and are of type 6, 32, 62, 117, 127, 128, 129, 180, 181, 182, 205
 or 229 are discovered. The single WAN interface discovered by this check is always of
 type 6. However, by default, if the WAN interface is currently down or if its status
 is not known, it will not be discovered.
