description:
 The check can be used to monitor the physical state of FANs in Fujitsu
 Siemens (FSC) Systems.

 This check uses the data provided by the SNMP agents supporting the
 {SNI-SERVER-CONTROL-MIB} MIB. The check has been created using Fujitsu
 Siemens Primergy Servers but should work on other hardware too.

 The check raises a WARNING state when the fan speed is below 90% of the maximum
 fan speed. The CRITICAL state is reported when the fan speed drops below 80%.

inventory:
 The check creates one service for each FAN provided in the SNMP data.
