description:
 This check reads the memory module status information from IPMI on
 FSC TX-120 systems (and maybe others).

 This check uses the information of the utility {ipmi-sensors}
 from the utility package {freeipmi}. You need your host kernel
 to support IPMI and have ipmi-sensors in your executable path for
 the agent to send that data.

 Addinionally you need to extend your agent on the monitored system
 using a check_mk_agent_plugin named {fsc_ipmi_mem_status.sh}. This
 agent plugin can be found in the {doc} directory of check_mk.

 To enable this plugin simply copy it to the plugins directory of
 check_mk_agent on your target machines. By default the directory
 is located here: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins

 This plugin has been developed on FSC TX 120 but may also work on
 other FSC hardware platforms. Please tell us when you find some
 other software where this plugin outputs valid information

 The plugin has been tested with freeipmi 0.5.1 and 0.8.4. Other
 versions may work too but have not been used during implementation.

item:
 This is the sensor name as reported by {ipmi-sensors} command e.g. {DIMM-1A}

inventory:
 One service is created for each memory module
 which has an attached module.
