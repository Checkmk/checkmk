description:
 The check can be used to monitor the physical state of hardware parts like PSUs and
 the system board in Fujitsu Siemens (FSC) Systems.

 This check uses the data provided by the SNMP agents supporting the
 {SNI-SERVER-CONTROL-MIB} MIB. The check has been created using Fujitsu
 Siemens Primergy Servers but should work on other hardware too.

 The check raises a CRITICAL state when parts are reported as degraded, error or failed.

item:
 Name of the hardware part

discovery:
 One service is created for each device.
