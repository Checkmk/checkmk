 - average write wait time
 - average latency (maximum average read/write time)

 special agent {Google Cloud Platform (GCP)}.

 Upper levels on disk usage, read/write IOPS and average wait times
 are configurable via the rule "GCP/Filestore".
 Default levels are configured for disk usage: 80%/90% (Warn/Crit).

discovery:
 One service is created for each NFS server.
