 To make this check work you have to configure the related special
 agent {Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Status}. The regions, which are
 discovered, can be configured.

 Importantly, since this check is based on the public health dashboard, there
 are more accurate ways to monitor GCP. If you can, choose the {Google
 Cloud Platform} monitoring over this monitoring solution.
