title: Genua: State of Carp Interfaces on Carp Clusters and Nodes

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the state of the carp interfaces of genuscreen devices.
 It can be used on single hosts as well as clusters. For the latter, the nodes of
 the carp cluster must be included in a Checkmk cluster, and the check must be configured as
 clustered service with an approriate rule. Clusters with more then two nodes are
 supported.
 The check detects if it is called on a cluster or a node. For a node the
 interface and carp state of the carp interface items are checked.
 For a cluster the check determines the number of carp interfaces on the cluster with
 the state master. If it is either {0} or {>1} the check is critical.

 The check is known to run with genuscreen version 3.0 and supports genuas regular
 enterprise ID 3717 as well as the ID 3137 which was introduced in a bug in some
 versions of genuscreen.

discovery:
 One service is created for the carp interface
 if the carp interface

 - has a system description OID (.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0)

 - OID name contains "genuscreen", "genuscript" or "genubox" (case insensitive).

item:
 The name of the carp interfaces
