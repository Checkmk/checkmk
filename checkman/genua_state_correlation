description:
 This check monitors if the two carp interfaces found on genuscreen devices
 have the same carp state. If not, the check is critical.

 The check is known to run with genuscreen version 3.0 and supports genuas regular
 enterprise id 3717 as well as the id 3137 which was introduced in a bug in some 
 versions of genuscreen.

perfdata:
 None

inventory:
 The inventory process checks if the device has a system description OIDs (.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0)
 and if the name of this OID contains "genuscreen" (case insensitive). 
 If this is true the system is inventorized.
