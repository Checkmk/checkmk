description:
 This Check queries the CPU utilization of various LAN switches that are
 supporting the MIB for H3C lan switches.  These are: newer 3COM switches
 (Superstack 4 and later), H3C branded switches and now for example the HP
 "A-Series" Networking gear. The same switches from the original maker Huawei
 are {not} supporting the MIB.  The check tries to correctly label the CPU in
 your switch / stack / core switch module slots.

 The check goes WARN/CRIT if the average CPU usage of the last {five minutes}
 exceeds configurable levels.

 Note that some of these switches don't handle SNMP well and might generate
 up to 90% cpu load while queried.  To accomodate for this you should lower
 the frequency of SNMP based checks with them.

 Some devices have a high usage even in normal conditions (i.e. running full
 BGP tables). In that case you might have to fine tune the check parameters
 or even have to disable the check.

inventory:
 One service is created for each CPU.

item:
 {{Switch}} followed by the ID of the switch followed by the CPU type
 (i.e. {{Slot}}, {{CPU}} or {{Unknown}}) followed by the number of the CPU
