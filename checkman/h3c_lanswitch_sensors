description:

 This check queries the fan and power supply sensors of various switches made by
 3Com and H3C. By default it will handle 3com Superstack 4 switches, but it should
 work with all devices defined in the "Lsw" lanswitch Mibs.

 This check returns:

 {OK} if the {active} state is reported for the sensor.

 {WARN} if the {not-install} or {unsupport} state is reported for the sensor.

 {CRIT} if the {deactive} state is reported for the sensor.

 {UNKNOWN} if the queried sensor is not found.

 Please note: some of these switches don't handle SNMP well and might generate
 up to 90% CPU load while queried.  To accomodate for this you should lower
 the frequency of SNMP based checks with them.

discovery:
 One service is created for each sensor.

item:
 {{Unit}} followed by the ID of the unit followed by the detected sensor (i.e. {{Fan}}
 or {{Powersupply}} and his identification number
