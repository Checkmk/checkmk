description:

 This check monitors the status of the servers of the HAProxy loadbalancer
 for TCP and HTTP connections. It requires the mk_haproxy.freebsd agent
 plugin to be installed on the FreeBSD host to be monitored. On linux it
 works with the standard agent.

 The check is {OK} if server is either {active} or {backup}. It is {CRIT} otherwise.
 Mapping between server status and monitoring states can be parametrized. By default,
 the check is {OK} if the server indicates the status {UP} and {CRIT} otherwise.

item:
 The name of backend and server, separated by a "/".

discovery:
 One service is created for each server.
