title: General status of the CRM for heartbeat nodes using crm=yes
agents: linux
catalog: os/services
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses the output of the {crm_mon} command as sent by the Check_MK
 linux agent. The check uses general information from that output like:
 The last update time of the output, the DC, the number of nodes and the number
 of resources in the cluster.

 The check reports CRITICAL in the following situations: When the "last update"
 time is larger than the threshold (normally {60} seconds), when the number
 of nodes or resources change or - optionally - when the expected DC of the cluster changes.

inventory:
 One service will be created on each node of the cluster. If {heartbeat_crm_naildown}
 is set to {True}, then the node which is currently DC will be required to stay
 DC in future.

[parameters]
max_age (int): Maximum age of the reported "last status" in seconds.
dc (string): The expected DC of the cluster. The check is disabled when the
 value is set to an empty string.
dc (string): The node which is expected to the the DC. If this is set to {None} then
 the DC is not checked.
num_nodes (int): Expected number of nodes in the cluster. The check is disabled
 when the value is set to -1.
num_resources (int): Expected number of resources in the cluster. The check is
 disabled when the value is set to -1.

[configuration]
heartbeat_crm_naildown (bool): Nails down the DC to the node which is the DC
 during inventory. The check will report CRITICAL when another node becomes the
 DC during later checks. If set to "False" the check will be passed.

heartbeat_crm_default_max_age (int): Default value of maximum age of "last updated"
 in seconds, used by inventorized checks.
