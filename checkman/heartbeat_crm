title: General status of the CRM for heartbeat nodes using crm=yes
agents: linux
catalog: os/services
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses the output of the {crm_mon} command as sent by the Check_MK
 linux agent. The check uses general information from that output like:
 The last update time of the output, the DC, the number of nodes and the number
 of resources in the cluster.

 The check reports CRITICAL in the following situations: When the "last update"
 time is larger than the threshold (normally {60} seconds), when the number
 of nodes or resources change or - optionally - when the expected DC of the cluster changes.

 Till version 1.2.5i6 the check nailed down the DC to the node which was DC during
 inventory. This has been changed to not nailing down the node. You can change this back
 to the old default by changing your configuration.

inventory:
 One service will be created on each node of the cluster. If {naildown_dc} is
 set to {True} in {inventory_heartbeat_crm_rules}, then the node which is currently
 DC will be required to stay DC in future.

[parameters]
max_age (int): Maximum age of the reported "last status" in seconds.
dc (string): The name of the node which is expected to be the DC. If this is set to {None} then
 the DC is not checked.
num_nodes (int): Expected number of nodes in the cluster. The check is disabled
 when the value is set to {None}.
num_resources (int): Expected number of resources in the cluster. The check is
 disabled when the value is set to {None}.
