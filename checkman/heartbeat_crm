title: General status of the CRM for heartbeat nodes using crm=yes
agents: linux
catalog: os/services
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses the output of the {crm_mon} command as sent by the Checkmk
 linux agent. The check uses general information from that output like:
 The last update time of the output, the DC, the number of nodes and the number
 of resources in the cluster.

 The check reports CRITICAL in the following situations: When the "last update"
 time is larger than the threshold (normally {60} seconds), when the number
 of nodes or resources change or - optionally - when the expected DC of the cluster changes.

 Till version 1.2.5i6 the check nailed down the DC to the node which was DC during
 inventory. This has been changed to not nailing down the node. You can change this back
 to the old default by changing your configuration.

inventory:
 One service will be created on each node of the cluster. If {naildown_dc} is
 set to {True} in {inventory_heartbeat_crm_rules}, then the node which is currently
 DC will be required to stay DC in future.
