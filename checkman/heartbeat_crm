title: Heartbeat/Pacemaker Cluster: General Node Status
agents: linux
catalog: os/services
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses the output of the {crm_mon} command as sent by the Checkmk
 linux agent. The check uses general information from that output like:
 The last update time of the output, the DC, the number of nodes and the number
 of resources in the cluster.

 The check reports CRITICAL in the following situations: When the "last update"
 time is larger than the threshold (normally {60} seconds), when the number
 of nodes or resources change or - optionally - when the expected DC of the cluster changes.

 Till version 1.2.5i6 the check nailed down the DC to the node which was DC during
 inventory. This has been changed to not nailing down the node. You can change this back
 to the old default by changing your configuration.

inventory:
 One service is created for each node of the cluster
 if {naildown_dc} is set to {True} in {inventory_heartbeat_crm_rules}.
