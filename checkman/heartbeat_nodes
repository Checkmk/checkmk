title: Heartbeat Cluster: Node Status and Link Status
agents: linux
catalog: os/services
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses the output of several cl_status calls as sent by the Checkmk
 linux agent to monitor the status of the linked nodes in a heartbeat cluster.
 Additionally all links of each node are checked.

 Each configured linked node will result in one service during inventory.

 The check will result in a CRITICAL state when the nodestatus is not "up",
 "ping" or "active". A link status different than "up" will also result in a
 CRITICAL state.

item:
 The name of the node as configured in the ha.cf configuration file.


inventory:
 One service is created for each node of a cluster.
