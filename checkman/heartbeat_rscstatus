 This check uses the output of several cl_status calls as sent by the Check_MK

 usable when the heartbeat cluster is configured not to use the crm
 (Cluster Resource Manager).

 Each node will get one service from this check.

 The check will result in a CRITICAL state when resource status during a check
 differs from the inventorized resource status.

 The resource status can be "all", "foreign", "local" or "none.

[parameters]
expected_state (string/list): The expected resource status. This can be one expected
 state as string or multiple expected states given as list. The parameter defaults to
 the resource status during inventory.
