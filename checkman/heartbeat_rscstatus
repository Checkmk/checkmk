description:
 This check uses the output of several cl_status calls as sent by the Checkmk
 linux agent to monitor the resource status of the local node. This check is
 usable when the heartbeat cluster is configured not to use the crm
 (Cluster Resource Manager).

 The check will result in a CRITICAL state when resource status during a check
 differs from the inventorized resource status.

 The resource status can be "all", "foreign", "local" or "none.

inventory:
 One service is created for each node.
