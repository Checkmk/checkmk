 It uses the check logic of the {if64} check, so for configuration parameters
 and examples please refer to the man page of {if64}.

 Values for ifHCInUcastPkts, ifHCInMulticastPkts, ifHCInBroadcastPkts,
 ifHCOutUcastPkts, ifHCOutMulticastPkts, ifHCOutBroadcastPkts, ifOutDiscards,
 ifOutErrors and ifOutQLen are always 0 and ifPhysAddress is empty, because
 they do not exist in this case.

 If configured to use the interface ID as item, it is build from
 the ID of the interface as a three digit number, prefixed with the ID
 of the ClusterNode. For Interface 2 on ClusterNode 1 e. g. 1002

 If configured to use the Alias or Description of an interface as item,
 it is build from the ID of the ClusterNode plus the ID of the interface
 separated by a dot. For Interface 2 on ClusterNode 1 e. g. 1.2
