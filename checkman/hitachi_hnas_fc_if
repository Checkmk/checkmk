description:
 This check monitors FibreChannel interfaces of Hitachi HNAS storage systems.
 The check is identical to {if64} with the restriction that ifHCInUcastPkts,
 ifHCInMulticastPkts, ifHCInBroadcastPkts, ifHCOutUcastPkts, ifHCOutMulticastPkts,
 ifHCOutBroadcastPkts, ifOutDiscards, ifOutErrors and ifOutQLen are always 0 and
 ifPhysAddress is empty, because these fields do not exist in this case. Please
 refer to the {if64} manpage for further documentation.

item:
 There are three allowed ways to specify an interface: its index, its description
 and its alias. Here, the index is built from the interface ID as a three-digit
 number prefixed with the ID of the ClusterNode, eg. 1002 for interface 2 on
 ClusterNode 1. The description and the alias are given by the interface and the
 ClusterNode ID separated by a dot, eg. 1.2 for interface 2 on ClusterNode 1.

discovery:
 One service is created for each interface that fulfills configurable conditions
 (rule "Network interface and switch port discovery").
 By default, these are interfaces which are currently found {up} and are of type 6,
 32, 62, 117, 127, 128, 129, 180, 181, 182, 205 or 229. Note that the interfaces
 discovered by this check do not have a type, so this restriction does not apply
 here.

 {Grouping:} In some situations, you do not want to monitor a single
 interface but a group of interfaces that together form a pool.
 This check supports such pools by defining groups. The data of all members is
 accumulated and put together in a single grouped interface service.

cluster:
 In the case where single (ungrouped) interfaces are clustered, the corresponding
 services report only the results from the node with the highest outgoing traffic,
 since this node is likely the active node.
 In the case where interface groups are clustered, the grouping is applied across
 all nodes, potentially combining interfaces from different nodes. Note that the
 rules defining the interface groups must be configured to apply to the nodes, not
 to the cluster host (the latter has no effect). In case the grouping configurations
 vary across the nodes, the last node wins.
