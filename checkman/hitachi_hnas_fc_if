 It uses the check logic of the {if64} check, so for configuration parameters
 and examples please refer to the man page of {if64}.

 Values for ifHCInUcastPkts, ifHCInMulticastPkts, ifHCInBroadcastPkts,
 ifHCOutUcastPkts, ifHCOutMulticastPkts, ifHCOutBroadcastPkts, ifOutDiscards,
 ifOutErrors and ifOutQLen are always 0 and ifPhysAddress is empty, because
 they do not exist in this case.

 it is build from the ID of the ClusterNode plus the ID of the interface
