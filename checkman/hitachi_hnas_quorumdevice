description:
 Checks the status of the quorum device in Hitachi HNAS storage systems.
 It was tested against Hitachi HNAS Modell 3090 but probably will work
 for other HNAS devices too - give it a try.

 Returns {OK} if the reported state is 4 "configured". Returns {WARN} on
 every other state according to BlueArc.3319.06 MIB and {UNKN} on every
 state not defined in the MIB.

inventory:
 One service is created on each HNAS having a Quorum Device.
