description:
 Checks the Usage of Spans (Storage Pools) in Hitachi HNAS storage systems.

 It uses the check logic of the {df} check, so for configuration parameters
 and examples please refer to the man page of {df}.

item:
 The ID of a Span plus it's label, separated by a space, e. g. 3 SP_91

perfdata:
 Three values: The first value is the used space of the filesystem
 in MB. Also the minimum (0 MB), maximum (size of the filesystem) and the
 warning and critical levels in MB are provided.
 The second is the change of the usage in MB per range since the last check
 (e.g. in MB per 24 hours) and the 3rd is the averaged change (so called
 trend), also in MB per range. Please note, that performance data for
 trends is enabled per default. You can globally disable that in {main.mk}
 with {filesystem_default_levels["trend_perfdata"] = False}.

inventory:
 Finds one item per Span.
