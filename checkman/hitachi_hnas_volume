description:
 Checks the Usage and Status of Volumes in Hitachi HNAS storage systems.

 For usage it uses the check logic of the {df} check, so for configuration
 parameters and examples please refer to the man page of {df}.

 If the status of a volume is reported to be "mounted", the check may
 return {OK}, on status "unformatted" or "formatted", the check returns
 at least {WARN}, on "needsChecking" it returns {CRIT} and {UNKN} on
 every other status.

 The worst status of both (usage levels and status) is returned by the check.

item:
 The ID of a Volume plus it's label, separated by a space, e. g. 1025 data

discovery:
 One service is created for each volume.
