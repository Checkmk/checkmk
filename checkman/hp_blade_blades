description:
 This check monitors the health of blades in HP BladeSysten enclosures.

 It uses the state reported by SNMP and prints the product name and serial
 number reported of each blade.

 Each blade which is present while the Checkmk service discovery will result in an
 own service. If the blade is not available anymore this service will be shown
 as CRITICAL service.

 Note: It seems that the MIB is not fully implemented on all systems so the
 check needs to show a "fake" OK when no status information is available. The
 other information like serial number and product name are printed anyway.

item:
 Number of the blade

discovery:
 One service is created for each blade with the state "present".
