description:
 This check monitors the health of the manager boards in HP BladeSysten enclosures.

 It uses the state reported by SNMP and prints the role name and serial
 number reported of each manager board.

 Each manager which is present while the Check_MK inventory will result in an
 own service. If the manager is not available anymore this service will be shown
 as CRITICAL service.

 Note: It seems that the MIB is not fully implemented on all systems so the
 check needs to show a "fake" OK when no status information is available. The
 other information like role name and serial number will be printed anyway.

item:
 Number of the manager (as string, not int).

examples:
 checks += [
  # Manually configured check:
  # Hostname, checkname, item-id, params
  ( "examplehost", "hp_blade_manager", "1", None)
 ]

inventory:
 All manager boards with the present state "present" are automatically inventorized.
