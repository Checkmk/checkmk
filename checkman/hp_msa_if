description:
 This check monitors the states, I/O operations and speed of the interfaces of
 HP MSA 2040 storage systems. To make this check work, you have to deploy the
 corresponding special agent via the rule "Check HP MSA via Web Interface".

 This check uses the same functionality as the check {if64}. Please refer to the
 manpage of {if64} for further documentation.

item:
 There are three allowed ways to specify an interface: its index, which simply
 enumerates the interfaces starting from 1, its description and its alias. Note
 that the interfaces discovered by this check do not have an alias (the alias
 is the empty string).

inventory:
 One service is created for each interface that fulfills configurable conditions
 (rule "Network interface and switch port discovery").
 By default, these are interfaces which are currently found {up} and are of type 6,
 32, 62, 117, 127, 128, 129, 180, 181, 182, 205 or 229. Note that all interfaces
 discovered by this check are of type 6.

 {Grouping:} In some situations, you do not want to monitor a single
 interface but a group of interfaces that together form a pool.
 This check supports such pools by defining groups. The data of all members is
 accumulated and put together in a single grouped interface service.

cluster:
 In the case where single (ungrouped) interfaces are clustered, the corresponding
 services report only the results from the node with the highest outgoing traffic,
 since this node is likely the active node.
 In the case where interface groups are clustered, the grouping is applied across
 all nodes, potentially combining interfaces from different nodes. Note that the
 rules defining the interface groups must be configured to apply to the nodes, not
 to the cluster host (the latter has no effect). In case the grouping configurations
 vary across the nodes, the last node wins.
