 This check monitors the health of all sensors in HP Procurve Switches which
 support the HP-ICF-CHASSIS MIB. The check uses the state reported by SNMP.

 These sensors include FAN, PSU and Temperature health.

 Each sensor which is in another state than "notPresent" will result in an
 own service.

item:
 Number of the sensor (as string, not int).

inventory:
 All sensors which are in another state than "notPresent" are automatically
 inventorized.
