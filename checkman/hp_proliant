description:
 This check connects to the SNMP agent installed on an operating system
 on a HP Proliant server and reads the general status information.
 In addition it also returns the serial number and firmware version.

 The status is {OK} only if the agent signals {Ok}, {WARN} on
 {Degraded} and {CRIT} on {Failed}. If you get an {UKNOWN} state you may need a Firmware Update

inventory:
 One service is created for each supported server.
