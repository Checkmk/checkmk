description:
 This check connects to the SNMP agent installed on an operating system
 on a HPE Proliant server and reads the information from the {CPQIDA-MIB}
 MIB.
 The systems SNMP agent is extended by the HPE Management Agents which need
 to be installed on the monitored systems.

 The check monitors the reported state of the RAID controllers in
 HPE Proliant Servers.

 This check has been developed with ProLiant DL360 G5 systems but should work
 on other HPE Proliant Servers too.

item:
