 This check connects to the SNMP agent installed on an operating system
 on a HP Proliant server and reads the information from the {CPQIDA-MIB}
 MIB.
 The systems SNMP agent is extended by the HP Management Agents which need
 to be installed on the monitored systems.

 The check monitors the reported state of the physical drives connected to the
 internal drive arrays of HP Proliant Servers.

 This check has been developed with ProLiant BL460c G1 systems but should work
 on other HP Proliant Servers too.
