 The systems SNMP agent is extended by the HP Management Agents which need
 to be installed on the monitored systems.

 The check monitors the reported state of the builtin memory state sensors.

 The slot in which the memory board or cartridge is installed.
 A value of 0 indicates memory installed directly on the system board.

 One check is automatically created for each present memory module.
