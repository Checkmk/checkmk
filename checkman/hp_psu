description:
 This check monitors the state of power supplies in HP switches. "maxstate"
 is treated as UNKNOWN, "not present", "not plugged" and "permanent failure" as CRIT,
 "failed" as WARN and "powered" as OK. The status code 8, which is not documented
 in the MIB, appears to mean the device is unplugged, which we treat as CRIT.

item:
 The index of the power supply

discovery:
 One service is created for each power supply.
