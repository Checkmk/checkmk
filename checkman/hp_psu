description:
 This check monitors the state of power supplies in HP switches. "maxstate"
 is treated as UNKNOWN, "not present", "not plugged" and "permanent failure" as CRIT,
 "failed" as WARN and "powered" as OK. The status code 8, which is not documented
 in the MIB, appears to mean the device is unplugged, which we treat as CRIT.

item:
 The power supplies' index.

inventory:
 One service per power supply is created.
