title: HP-UX: CPU Load
agents: hpux
catalog: os/kernel
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check measures and checks the averaged CPU load. The values
 for 1, 5 and 15 minute average are sent, although the PNP template
 shipped with check_mk only displays the 1 and 15 min average load.

 This check is compatible with the check {cpu.loads} of the linux
 agent.

inventory:
 One service is created if the agent outputs valid data.
