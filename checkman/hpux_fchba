description:
 This check is intended to alert you of problems in a servers SAN
 connection. It can differentiate different FC Login states and
 different driver states. If a port looses connectivity, you will
 be getting a {"CRIT"} status.

 The check will go to {"UNKNOWN"} if the HBA is removed, or to
 {"WARNING"} if it detects a Firmware crashdump.

 The check reports the HBAs hardware path to ease troubleshooting.
 The agent also reports WWN info, but this is currently unused.


item:
 The name of the adapter, i.e. "fcd0"


inventory:
 One item for every HBA using the {"fcd"} driver that had an
 active SAN connection at the time of inventory.
 Older {"td"} / {"fcms"} based HBAs are not reported from the
 agent per default.
