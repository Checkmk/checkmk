description:

 This check measures the throughput LUNs on HP-UX. This check
 is fully compatible with {diskstat} and uses the same
 parameters and configuration variables.

item:
 Either {"SUMMARY"} for a summarized check of alls LUNs or the
 name of the disk device, e.g. {"sda"}. In order to support configurations
 up to version 1.1.10 also the items {"read"} and {"write"} are supported.

inventory:
  The inventory is configured via {diskstat_inventory_mode}. If this is set
  to {"single"} (the default), then one check will be created for each
  disk. If it is set to {"summary"} then only one service per host will be
  created that has at least one hard disk. If set to {"legacy"} then a
  separate check for read and write will be created (deprecated).
