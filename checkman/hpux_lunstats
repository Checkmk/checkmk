description:

 This check measures the throughput LUNs on HP-UX. This check
 is fully compatible with {diskstat} and uses the same
 parameters and configuration variables.

item:
 Either {"SUMMARY"} for a summarized check of alls LUNs or the
 name of the disk device, e.g. {"sda"}. In order to support configurations
 up to version 1.1.10 also the items {"read"} and {"write"} are supported.

inventory:
  One service is created for each disk if the mode is set to {"single"} (default).
  If the mode is set to {"summary"} one summary service is created.
  If the mod  is set to {"legacy"} one service is created
  for each read and write (deprecated).
  The mode is configured via {diskstat_inventory_mode}.
