description:
 This check monitors the state of Multipath groups (LUNs) on HP-UX.
 Each path can be in the state {ACTIVE}, {STANDBY}, {FAILED} or {UNOPEN}.
 The check parameter specifies the number of pathes expected in the
 various states (usually active and standby). The check triggers critical,
 if at least one path is {FAILED}. It triggers a warning if the number
 of paths in the various states has changed (e.g. if a path has completely
 vanished or switched from active to standby).

item:
 The WWID of the LUN.

inventory:
 One service is created for each LUN that has at least
 two paths which are not {UNOPEN}. LUNs with all paths
 in state {UNOPEN} will be ignored. Also LUNs with only
 one path will be ignored (there are usually local devices).
