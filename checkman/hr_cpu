description:
 The {HOST-RESOURCES-MIB} is a standardized MIB provided by many
 SNMP agents. This check uses that MIB in order to monitor the
 current CPU utilization of the target host. Please note, that - unlike
 check based on the check_mk_agent, the percentage does not reflect
 the usage during the complete check interval but is just a snapshot
 of the current usage.

inventory:
 One service is created if at least one CPU entry is found.
