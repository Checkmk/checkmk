title: SNMP HOST-RESOURCES-MIB: Used Space in Filesystems
agents: snmp
catalog: os/storage
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the usage of filesystems using SNMP and
 the {HOST-RESOURCES-MIB}, which is supported by many SNMP
 agents - especially those on full operating systems.

 For configuration parameters and examples please refer to the man page
 of {df}.

 Please note, that due to the fact that Linux usually reserves 5% of
 the filesystem for root, the amount of used space output by this
 check and the native {df} check of Linux differs by up to 5%. The
 {df} check accounts the reserved space as used, as this is a safer
 assumption. Whereas the SNMP agent accounts it as free. There is no
 way to get the information about the reserved space via SNMP, so
 there is no way to fix this, unfortunately.

item:
 The description of the filesystem as in {hrStorageDescr}. For
 Linux SNMP agents this is the mount point.

discovery:
 One service is created for each fixed disk if the description
 of the filesystem in not listed in {inventory_df_exclude_mountpoints}.
