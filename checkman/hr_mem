description:
 This check measures the usage of physical RAM and virtual memory
 using the {HOST-RESOURCES-MIB}, which is provided by many SNMP
 agents (especially those on standard operating systems).

 The logic used for monitoring is exactly the same as in the
 agent based check {mem.used}. Please refer to the man page
 of that check for details.

discovery:
 One service is created for the target host if the needed information
 is available via SNMP.
