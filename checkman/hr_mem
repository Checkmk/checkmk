title: Usage of physical and virtual RAM using SNMP
agents: snmp
catalog: os/kernel

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check measures the usage of physical RAM and virtual memory
 using the {HOST-RESOURCES-MIB}, which is provided by many SNMP
 agents (especially those on standard operating systems).

 The logic used for monitoring is exactly the same as in the
 agent based check {mem.used}. Please refer to the man page
 of that check for details.

inventory:
 If the needed information is available via SNMP one service
 for the target host will be created.

perfdata:
 Three variables: the physical RAM, the virtual memory and the
 sum of both.
