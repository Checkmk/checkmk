description:
 The {HOST-RESOURCES-MIB} is a standardized MIB provided by many
 SNMP agents. This check uses that MIB in order to monitor the
 current processes of the target host.

 No default levels are set. Upper and lower levels for the amount
 of processes can be configured.
 The status running, runnable, not runnable or invalid can be
 mapped th OK, WARN, CRIT or UNKNOWN. The default is OK.

item:
 A user defined name which must be unique.

inventory:
 One service is created for each user defined name.
 Within the discovery rule {Process discovery (only SNMP)} you can specify
 which processes are taken into account.
 You can either match on the process name {hrSWRunName}
 or the process path {hrSWRunPath}, and the process status {hrSWRunStatus}.

 The {service description} may contain one or more occurances of {%s}.
 If you do this, then the pattern must be a regular expression and
 be prefixed with {~}. For each {%s} in the description, the expression has to contain
 one "group". A group is a subexpression enclosed in brackets, for example
 {(.*)} or {([a-zA-Z]+)} or {(...)}. When the discovery finds a process
 matching the pattern, it will substitute all such groups with the
 {actual values} when creating the check. That way one rule can create
 several checks on a host.

 If the pattern contains more groups then occurrances of {%s} in
 the service description then only the first matching subexpressions
 are used for the service descriptions. The matched substrings corresponding
 to the remaining groups are copied into the regular expression, nevertheless.
