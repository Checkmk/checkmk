title: Hyper-V Server: State of VMs
agents: windows
catalog: os/services

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This checks queries a Microsoft Hyper-V Server via an agent plugin (hyperv_vms.ps1) and
 checks the current state of the VM. The state is then mapped to a monitoring state. The
 default mapping is:

 FastSaved => OK

 FastSavedCritical => CRIT

 FastSaving => OK

 FastSavingCritical => CRIT

 Off => WARN

 OffCritical => CRIT

 Other => UNKNOWN

 Paused => OK

 PausedCritical => CRIT

 Pausing => OK

 PausingCritical => CRIT

 Reset => WARN

 ResetCritical => CRIT

 Resuming => OK

 ResumingCritical => CRIT

 Running => OK

 RunningCritical => CRIT

 Saved => OK

 SavedCritical => CRIT

 Saving => OK

 SavingCritical => CRIT

 Starting => OK

 StartingCritical => CRIT

 Stopping => WARN

 StoppingCritical => CRIT

 This mapping can be configured using the rule "State of Microsoft Hyper-V Server VMs".

 Furthermore, the check can also be configured to compare the current state of the VM against
 the state at the point in time when the service was discovered. In this case, the service will
 go to CRIT if the two states do not match. Note that if the check is executed as a manual check,
 this option can still be used, however, the resulting monitoring state will always be UNKN in this
 case, since there is no discovered state available to compare against.

item:
 Name of the virtual machine

discovery:
 One service is created for each system.
