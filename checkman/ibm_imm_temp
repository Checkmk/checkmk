description:
 This check monitors the data of temperature sensors
 via a IBM Integrated Management Module (IMM). It uses snmp and the
 IBM IMM MIB to gather and interpret the sensor data.

 Per default the check uses the lower and upper warning and critical levels
 extracted from the device (OIDs {tempCritLimitLow}, {tempNonCritLimitLow},
 {tempNonCritLimitHigh}, {tempCritLimitHigh}) to calculate the state of
 the service.

 Alternatively, limits can be configured via a rule.

inventory:
 One service is created for each temperature sensor.

item:
 The name of the temperature sensor as extracted from the OID {tempDescr}
