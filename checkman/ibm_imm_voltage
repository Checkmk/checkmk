description:
 This check monitors the voltages provided by the power supply and CMOS
 battery of servers via a IBM Integrated Management Module (IMM). It uses
 snmp and the IBM IMM MIB to gather the data.

 The check uses the lower and upper warning and critical levels extracted
 from the device (OIDs {voltCritLimitLow}, {voltNonCritLimitLow},
 {voltCritLimitHigh} ,{voltNonCritLimitHigh}) to calculate the state of
 the service.

inventory:
 One service is created for each voltage measurement channel.

item:
 The name of the power supply measurement channel as extracted from the OID {voltDescr}
