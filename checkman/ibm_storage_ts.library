description:
  This check displays the device status per library, as well as the
  drive count and any faults the device reports itself.

  The check status will be the worst status derived from device status
  and severity of the current fault (if any).
  Device Status will resolve to {OK} if the device status is documented
  as "Ok", {WARN} if it's "non-critical", "other" or "unknown" and
  {CRIT} for "critical" and "non-Recoverable" status.

  No fault or "informational" faults lead to status {OK}, "minor" faults
  to {WARN}, "major" and "critical" faults to {CRIT}
