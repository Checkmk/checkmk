description:
 Checks the status of IO Groups of an IBM SVC / Storwize V3700 / V7000 device.

 If all nodes of an IO Group report status {online} the check returns
 {OK}. If all nodes of an IO Group report some other status (e. g.
 {offline}) the check returns {CRIT}. And in all other cases - that
 means if at least one node is {online} - the check returns {WARN}.

 Please note: You need the Special Agent agent_ibmsvc to retrieve the monitoring
 data from the device. Your monitoring user must be able to SSH to the device
 with SSH Key Authentification. Please exchange SSH key. The Special Agent itself
 can be configured by WATO.
