title: Monitor Network Interfaces via Standard MIB Using 64-Bit Counters
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/network/generic
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check does the same as {interfaces} but uses 64-bit counters from
 the {IF-MIB} {.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1}. This allows to correctly
 monitor switch ports with a traffic of more then 2GB per check interval.

 Also, this check can use {ifAlias} instead if {ifDescr} for retrieving
 the admin-configured interface description. This is useful e.g. for HP ProCurve
 switches which do not show the aliasses in {ifDescr}.

 {Note}: This check needs SNMP v2c and thus only works if your hosts are
 added to {bulkwalk_hosts}.

 Depending on the check parameters, this check can go WARN or CRIT when the
 port status changes (i.e. is down), when the link speed changes (e.g. a
 port expected to be set to 1 GBit/s operates only at 100 MBit/s), when the
 absolute or procentual traffic of a port exceeds certain levels or if the
 rate of errors or discards exceeds configurable limits.

 This check supports averaging the in- and outgoing traffic over a configurable
 time range by using an exponentially weighted moving average - just as Linux
 does for the CPU load averages. The averaging can be configured on a per-host
 and per-interface base. Interfaces with averaging turned on yield two additional
 performance values: the averaged in- and outgoing traffic in bytes. If you have
 configured traffic levels, then those levels are applied to the averaged values.

 This check also supports monitoring of the administrative status ({ifAdminStatus}),
 however, by default, this option is deactivated to reduce SNMP traffic. To activate
 the monitoring of the admin status, you have to configure Checkmk to fetch this
 information. This is done by activating the section {if64adm} via the rule
 "Disabled or enabled sections (SNMP)", which will lead to an increase in SNMP
 traffic of approximately 5%.

 Note that there are some devices with broken firmware which report that
 they support 64-bit counters even though they do not. In such cases, use the rule
 "Disabled or enabled sections (SNMP)" to disable the section {if64}. This will make
 Checkmk fall back to the 32-bit interface check.

item:
 There are three allowed ways to specify an interface: its index {ifIndex}, its
 description {ifDescr} and its alias {ifAlias}.

inventory:
 One service is created for each interface that fulfills configurable conditions
 (rule "Network interface and switch port discovery").
 By default, these are interfaces which are currently found {up} and are of type 6, 32,
 62, 117, 127, 128, 129, 180, 181, 182, 205 or 229.

 {Grouping:} In some situations, you do not want to monitor a single
 interface but a group of interfaces that together form a pool.
 This check supports such pools by defining groups. The data of all members is
 accumulated and put together in a single grouped interface service.

cluster:
 In the case where single (ungrouped) interfaces are clustered, the corresponding
 services report only the results from the node with the highest outgoing traffic,
 since this node is likely the active node.
 In the case where interface groups are clustered, the grouping is applied across
 all nodes, potentially combining interfaces from different nodes. Note that the
 rules defining the interface groups must be configured to apply to the nodes, not
 to the cluster host (the latter has no effect). In case the grouping configurations
 vary across the nodes, the last node wins.
