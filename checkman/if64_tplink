item:
 There are three allowed ways to specify a port: {1}: the last component of
 the SNMP OID number (as string), the {ifDescr} of the port or the {ifAlias} of
 the port. If you are using the alias, you have to make sure that it is unique
 by configuring useful aliases in the switch. Checkmk does not check for uniqueness.


description:
 This check is a copy if {if64} but fixes two bugs of TP-LINK in their
 MIB implementation that lead to wrong interface speed and wrong
 alias names of ports. Both issues have been worked around in this
 check plugin. Please refer to {if64} for the complete manual page.
