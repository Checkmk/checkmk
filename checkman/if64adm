item:
 There are three allowed ways to specify a port: {1}: the last component of
 the SNMP OID number (as string), the {ifDescr} of the port or the {ifAlias} of
 the port. If you are using the alias, you have to make sure that it is unique
 by configuring useful aliases in the switch. Check_MK does not check for uniqueness.


description:
 This check does the same is {if64}, but also takes the administrative
 status ({ifAdminStatus}) of the interface into account. The admin
 status of 2 (down) is mapped to an artificial operational status 9 (admin down).
 That way you are able to ignore the effective state of the interface as
 long as it is "admin down" and still get alarmed if ports go down while
 the admin status is up.
