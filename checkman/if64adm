title: Monitor Network Interfaces Including the ifAdminStatus
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/network/generic
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk

item:
 There are three allowed ways to specify a port: {1}: the last component of
 the SNMP OID number (as string), the {ifDescr} of the port or the {ifAlias} of
 the port. If you are using the alias, you have to make sure that it is unique
 by configuring useful aliases in the switch. Checkmk does not check for uniqueness.


description:
 This check does the same is {if64}, but also takes the administrative
 status ({ifAdminStatus}) of the interface into account. The admin
 status of 2 (down) is mapped to an artificial operational status 9 (admin down).
 That way you are able to ignore the effective state of the interface as
 long as it is "admin down" and still get alarmed if ports go down while
 the admin status is up.

inventory:
 One service is created for each port that fulfills configurable conditions.
 Per default these are ports which are currently found {up} and are of types {6} (ethernetCsmacd),
 {32} (frameRelay), {117} (gigabitEthernet) or several others.

 For further details look at {if64} manpage.
