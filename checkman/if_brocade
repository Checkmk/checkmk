title: Brocade VDX devices: Network interfaces via standard MIB using 64 Bit counters
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/network/brocade
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk

item:
 There are three allowed ways to specify a port: {1}: the last component of
 the SNMP OID number (as string), the {ifDescr} of the port or the {ifAlias} of
 the port. If you are using the alias, you have to make sure that it is unique
 by configuring useful aliases in the switch. Check_MK does not check for uniqueness.

description:
 This check does exactly the same as {if64} but retrieves {ifName} instead
 of {ifDescr}, because {ifDescr} is not useful in Brocade VDX devices.

 Please refer to the if64 manpage for documentation.
