title: Brocade VDX Devices: Network Interfaces via Standard MIB Using 64-Bit Counters
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/network/brocade
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check does exactly the same as {if64} but retrieves {ifName} instead of {ifDescr},
 because {ifDescr} is not useful for Brocade VDX devices. Please refer to the if64 manpage
 for documentation.

item:
 There are three allowed ways to specify an interface: its index {ifIndex}, its
 description, which is taken from {ifName}, and its alias {ifAlias}.

inventory:
 One service is created for each interface that fulfills configurable conditions
 (rule "Network interface and switch port discovery").
 By default, these are interfaces which are currently found {up} and are of type 6, 32,
 62, 117, 127, 128, 129, 180, 181, 182, 205 or 229.

 {Grouping:} In some situations, you do not want to monitor a single
 interface but a group of interfaces that together form a pool.
 This check supports such pools by defining groups. The data of all members is
 accumulated and put together in a single grouped interface service.

cluster:
 In the case where single (ungrouped) interfaces are clustered, the corresponding
 services report only the results from the node with the highest outgoing traffic,
 since this node is likely the active node.
 In the case where interface groups are clustered, the grouping is applied across
 all nodes, potentially combining interfaces from different nodes. Note that the
 rules defining the interface groups must be configured to apply to the nodes, not
 to the cluster host (the latter has no effect). In case the grouping configurations
 vary across the nodes, the last node wins.
