title: Fortigate Devices: Network Interfaces via Standard MIB Using 64 Bit Counters
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/network/fortinet
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk

item:
 There are three allowed ways to specify a port: {1}: the last component of
 the SNMP OID number (as string), the {ifDescr} of the port or the {ifAlias} of
 the port. If you are using the alias, you have to make sure that it is unique
 by configuring useful aliases in the switch. Checkmk does not check for uniqueness.

description:
 This check does exactly the same as {if64} but retrieves {ifName} instead
 of {ifAlias}, because {ifAlias} is not useful in Fortigate firewalls.

 Please refer to the if64 manpage for documentation.

inventory:
 One service is created for each port that fulfills configurable conditions.
 Per default these are ports which are currently found {up} and are of types {6} (ethernetCsmacd),
 {32} (frameRelay), {117} (gigabitEthernet) or several others.

 For further details look at {if64} manpage.
