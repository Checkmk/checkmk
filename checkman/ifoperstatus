title: Operational Status of Network Interfaces - DEPRECATED

description:
 This check polls the SNMP OID .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2 (IF-MIB::ifOperStatus)
 which is part of the standard SNMP interfaces MIB. It checks network interfaces
 for their operational status (the link). The link can either be 'up' or 'down'.
 The check status is OK if the actual link status is equal to the target status.
 If the target status is 'up' and the link status is 'down', the check gets
 CRITICAL. If the link status is 'up' and the target status is 'down', the check
 gets into WARNING status.

item:
 A string: the name of the interface as in .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2 (IF-MIB::ifDescr). The
 OID index is not relevant.

inventory:
 One service is created for each interfaces if it is of the correct type (default is {ethernetCsmacd}).
