title: Inotify: Monitor File System Operations
agents: linux
catalog: os/files
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check evaluates the data reported by the mk_inotify plugin on the target system.
 This plugin requires the python module pyinotify to be installed.
 Inotify allows you to monitor certain file operations on the target system. E.g. you will
 get a message for specific operations like {access}, {open}, {create}, {delete}, {modify}.
 In the agent bakery you can configure the files and folders to be monitored and specify in
 which operation you are interested in.
 You can configure levels relating to the age of the last operation.
 So you can check last modified age for example.

item:
 {{file}} or {{folder}} plus the path to it

discovery:
 One service is created for each explictely specified file and folder in the mk_inotify.cfg.
