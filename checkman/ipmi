title: Ipmitool: Hardware Sensors
agents: linux

description:
 This check makes use of the output of a working {ipmitool} on
 a Linux system. If the kernel properly supports IPMI and {ipmitool}
 is installed, then the agent will output the current state of
 power supplies, cooling devices, temperatures and other devices
 avaiable via IPMI. This check makes
 sure that all those devices are working properly.

 Fortunately, IPMI provides not only the current sensor values but also
 their state, so no levels need to be configured for this checks.

 This check provides a summarized mode, where all sensors appear as one
 summary check per host and a detailed mode with one check per sensor.

 Please note: on some systems IPMI reports sensors in a non-ok state wheras
 actually no problem exists. As of version 1.1.11i1 these sensors can be
 ignored with the configuration variable {ipmi_ignored_sensors}.

item:
 {"Summary"} for summary mode, the name of the IPMI item
 in detailed mode.

inventory:
 One summary service is created in summary mode if at least one sensor is found.
 One service is created for each sensor in detailed mode.

 Note: Some obscure hardware lists sensors in the state
 {nr} which do not produce usable output. If you set
 {impi_ignore_nr} to {True} then these sensors will
 be ignored.
