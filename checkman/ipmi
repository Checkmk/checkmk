description:
 This check monitors the output of {ipmitool} on Linux systems. If the kernel
 supports IPMI and {ipmitool} is installed, then the agent will output the
 current state of power supplies, cooling devices, temperature sensors and
 other devices available via IPMI.

 The check reports the sensor state and the value measured by the sensor, if
 available. Furthermore, if the sensor reports upper or lower levels, these
 are checked against the currently reported value.

 Using the rule "IPMI sensors", user-defined levels can be configured (per
 sensor). Furthermore, this rule offers the option to define custom mappings
 from sensor states to monitoring states. Finally, the rule allows for ignoring
 sensors by their name or by their state (summary mode only, see below).

item:
 {"Summary"} for summary mode (see below) or the name of the IPMI item for the
 detailed mode.

discovery:
 The check offers two modes for discovering sensors. In summary mode, if at least
 one sensor is found, a single service is discovered. This service summarizes the
 states of all IPMI sensors. In the detailed mode, one service is created for
 each discovered sensor. Users can switch between the modes using the rule "IPMI
 sensor discovery". Furthermore, in detailed mode, this rule offers the option
 to ignore sensors either by their name of by their state. Ignored sensors will
 not be discovered.
