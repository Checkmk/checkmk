title: Ipmitool: Hardware Sensors
agents: linux

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check makes use of the output of a working {ipmitool} on
 a Linux system. If the kernel properly supports IPMI and {ipmitool}
 is installed, then the agent will output the current state of
 power supplies, cooling devices, temperatures and other devices
 avaiable via IPMI. This check makes
 sure that all those devices are working properly.

 Fortunately, IPMI provides not only the current sensor values but also
 their state, so no levels need to be configured for this checks.

 This check provides a summarized mode, where all sensors appear as one
 summary check per host and a detailed mode with one check per sensor.

 Please note: on some systems IPMI reports sensors in a non-ok state wheras
 actually no problem exists. As of version 1.1.11i1 these sensors can be
 ignored with the configuration variable {ipmi_ignored_sensors}.

item:
 {"Summary"} for summary mode, the name of the IPMI item
 in detailed mode.

inventory:
 In summary mode, one check is created if at least one
 sensor is found by the agent. In detailed mode one
 item is created for each sensor found.

 Note: Some obscure hardware lists sensors in the state
 {nr} which do not produce usable output. If you set
 {impi_ignore_nr} to {True} then these sensors will
 be ignored.
