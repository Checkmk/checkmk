title: Freeimpmi: IPMI Sensors
agents: linux
catalog: os/hardware
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses the information of the utility {ipmi-sensors}
 from the utility package {freeipmi}. You need your host kernel
 to support IPMI and have ipmi-sensors in your executable path for
 the agent to send that data. The current implementation of
 the agents sends the status of all available fans, temperature
 sensors and power supplies.

item:
 A combination of sensor group and sensor name, with spaces replaced
 by underscores in the sensor name. For example
 {Fan_FAN2_CPU} for a sensor of the group {Fan} with the name {FAN2 CPU}.

inventory:
 One service is created for each sensor that is not in the state {[Unknown]}.
