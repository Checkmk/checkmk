title: Iptables modifications
agents: linux
catalog: os/misc
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check computes the differences between the current output of the
 command iptables-save and a cached initial state persisted on the
 monitoring server.
 The check is OK if no changes can be detected and CRIT otherwise.
 If the state is CRIT a diff of the cached and initial configurations
 is shown in the long output. If a user wants to accept the diff a
 service rediscovery can be performed.

inventory:
 One check per system is created if the agent plugin mk_iptables was
 deployed.
