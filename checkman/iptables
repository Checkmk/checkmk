title: Iptables Modifications
agents: linux

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check computes the differences between the current output of the
 command iptables-save and a cached initial state persisted on the
 monitoring server.
 The check is OK if no changes can be detected and CRIT otherwise.
 If the state is CRIT a diff of the cached and initial configurations
 is shown in the long output. If a user wants to accept the diff a
 service rediscovery can be performed.

discovery:
 One service is created for each system if the agent plugin mk_iptables was deployed.
