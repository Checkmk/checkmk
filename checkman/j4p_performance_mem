title: Java Application Server: Memory Usage (deprecated)
agents: linux
catalog: app/java
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 Do not use this plugin. It will be removed soon. Use jolokia_metrics instead.

 This checks uses the JSON HTTP service of j4p (from jmx4perl) to
 monitor the current memory usage of a Java application server like
 Tomcat or JBoss. You can define levels against the total memory
 usage of the Java machine (heap + non heap).

 In order for the check to work, you need to load the j4p.war into your
 application server. Furthermore you need the agent plugin {j4p_performance}
 in your Checkmk agent's plugins directory. If you do not use the
 default port 8080 for j4p - lets say {9090} - then you have to create
 a configuration file {j4p.conf} in the agents configuration directory
 (usually {/etc/check_mk/j4p.conf}) with the single line {port = 9090}.

 Note: No jmx4perl is needed - neither on the target host nor
 on the monitoring server. No Perl is needed, either.
 The agent connects to the application server always via {localhost}.

item:
 The instance name as configured in {j4p.conf} with the variable
 {instance}. If you do not specify an instance then the port number
 converted to a string is used.

 Please note that the current implementation of the agent plugin
 supports only one instance per host.

discovery:
 One service is created for each JMX instance sent by the agent.
 The agent currently supports only one instance, but that might
 be changed in future.
