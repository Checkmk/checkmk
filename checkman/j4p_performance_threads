 monitor the number of threads created by a Java application server like
 Tomcat or JBoss. You can define levels against the number of threads
 of the Java machine.

 Take a look at the {j4p_performance.mem} manpage for instructions
 on how to set up the needed agent plugin.

item:
 The instance name as configured in {j4p.conf} with the variable
 {instance}.
