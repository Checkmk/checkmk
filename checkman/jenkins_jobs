description:
 This check monitors the state of jenkins jobs. Beside the state of the job it
 gives informations about the job score and the time since the last successful
 build. It also outputs informations about the last build, like the time the
 build was triggered, the build id, duration and result.

 For performance reasons, the number of recognized jobs is limited to three
 nested folder levels.

item:
 Either the name of the job {"JOBNAME"} or, if the job is lokated in a folder,
 the folder names followed by the job name, e.g. {"FOLDER1 FOLDER2 JOBNAME"}.

inventory:
 One service per job will be created
