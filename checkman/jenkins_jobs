description:
 This check monitors the state of jenkins jobs. Beside the display name and the
 state of the job it gives informations about the job score and the time since
 the last successful build. It also outputs informations about the last build,
 like the time the build was triggered, the build ID, duration and result.

 For performance reasons, the number of recognized jobs is limited to three
 nested folder levels.

item:
 Either the name of the job {"JOBNAME"} or, if the job is located in a folder,
 the folder path followed by the job name, e.g. {"FOLDER1/FOLDER2/JOBNAME"}.

discovery:
 One service is created for each job.
