agents: linux

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors state and performance information of any linux program
 call, for example regular running cronjobs.

 The check uses information provided by the wrapper program {mk-job}. This
 program is shipped with the linux agent and installed to {/usr/bin}.
 {mk-job} is a wrapper which is called instead of the program. For
 example, if you have a command line {nightly-backup >/dev/null} which gets
 executed by a cronjob every night, you can change the command line to
 {mk-job backup nightly-backup >/dev/null} to let mk-job collect information
 about the job during runtime. In this expression, the string {backup} is
 the identifier of the job to be executed. It must be a unique identifier
 for this job on each host. When the job is finished, {mk-job} writes the
 collected data to {/var/lib/check_mk_agent/job/<identifier>}. The agent sends
 all these data to the Check_MK server.

 The check is {CRITICAL} if the exit code of the job is not {0}, or if
 warning or critical limits for the job age have been reached.

 Limits can be configured with WATO.

item:
 The identifier of the job defined by the first argument to {mk-job}.

inventory:
 One check per job will be created.
