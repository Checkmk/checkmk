description:
 This check monitors state and performance information of any linux program
 call, for example regular running cronjobs.

 The check uses information provided by the wrapper program {mk-job}. This
 program is shipped with the linux agent and installed to {/usr/bin}.
 {mk-job} is a wrapper which is called instead of the program. For
 example, if you have a command line {nightly-backup >/dev/null} which gets
 executed by a cronjob every night, you can change the command line to
 {mk-job backup nightly-backup >/dev/null} to let mk-job collect information
 about the job during runtime. In this expression, the string {backup} is
 the identifier of the job to be executed. It must be a unique identifier
 for this job on each host. When the job is finished, {mk-job} writes the
 collected data to {/var/lib/check_mk_agent/job/<identifier>}. The agent sends
 all these data to the Checkmk server.

 The check is {CRITICAL} if the exit code of the job is not {0}, or if
 warning or critical limits for the job age have been reached. Other mappings
 of exit code to check state can be defined in the check parameters.

 Limits can be configured with WATO.

 This check is also cluster-aware and worst or best state is configurable.
 Default is worst state.

item:
 The identifier of the job defined by the first argument to {mk-job}.

inventory:
 One service is created for each job.

cluster:
  The outcome on a cluster can be configured to be either the worst, or the
  best state encountered for every job.
