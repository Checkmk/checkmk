title: Jolokia: Generic Numeric MBean Rate
agents: linux
catalog: app/java
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check outputs the rate of a generic numeric value from the java virtual machine.
 This check can go WARN or CRIT when the rate is below or above certain
 configurable levels.

 To use this plugin, Jolokia and the agent plugin need to be installed
 on the monitored server.

 Please note that this check was designed with single values in mind.
 It is best utilized using explicit configuration of specific MBeans
 and their titles.
 While bulk requests of MBeans may appear to work, it will probably
 have undesired side effects (such as ugly formatting or discovery
 of services always in UNKNOWN state), and is therefore strongly
 discouraged.

item:
 The name of the instance and the MBean value

inventory:
 One service is created for each numeric MBean rate value sent by the agent.
