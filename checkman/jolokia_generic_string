title: Jolokia: Generic MBean String Value
agents: linux
catalog: app/java
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check outputs a generic string value from the java virtual machine.
 This check can go WARN or CRIT depending on whether it matches a configurable
 list of search strings.

 To use this plugin, Jolokia and the agent plugin need to be installed
 on the monitored server.

 Please note that this check was designed with single values in mind.
 It is best utilized using explicit configuration of specific MBeans
 and their titles.
 While bulk requests of MBeans may appear to work, it will probably
 have undesired side effects (such as ugly formatting or discovery
 of services always in UNKNOWN state), and is therefore strongly
 discouraged.

item:
 The name of the instance and the MBean value

discovery:
 One service is created for each MBean string value sent by the agent.
