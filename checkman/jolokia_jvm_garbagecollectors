description:
 This check monitors the count and assumed time of the garbage collection. It
 helps to recognize any deviation from the regular behaviour of the garbage
 collection.  Such deviations could be more garbage collection runs per
 second or an increase in the time that is spent collecting garbage.

 Since every system has a different behaviour there are no default
 values set to avoid false alarms.

 To use this plugin, Jolokia and the agent plugin need to be installed
 on the monitored server (ore the special agent must be configured).

item:
 The name of the application server instance and name of the garbage collection
 as sent by the agent seperated by the the statement {{GC}}.

discovery:
 One service is created for each garbage collector sent by the Jolokia agent.
