title: Java Virtual Machine: Garbage Collection (deprecated)
agents: linux
catalog: app/java
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:

 This check is depricated and has been replaced by the plugin
 jolokia_jvm_garbagecollectors which provides the same functionality.

 This check monitors the count and assumed time of the garbage collection. It
 helps to recognize any deviation from the regular behaviour of the garbage
 collection.  Such deviations could be more garbage collection runs per
 minute or an increase in the time the garbage collection is using per minute.

 Since every tomcat instance has a different behaviour there are no default
 values set to avoid false alarms.

 To use this plugin, Jolokia and the agent plugin need to be installed
 on the monitored server.

item:
 The name of the application server instance and name of the garbage collection
 as sent by the agent.

inventory:
 One service is created for each garbage collector sent by the Jolokia agent.
