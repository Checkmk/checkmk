 This check allows to monitor the number of current connections to
 a JVM application (i.e. /host-manager or /my-web-app)

 To use this plugin, Jolokia and the agent plugin need to be installed
 on the monitored server.

 The check can alert if the {WARN}/{CRIT} thresholds for a configurable total
 is exceeded.

 The name of the application server instance as configured by the agent
 followed by the name of the application. I.e. tomcat7 /examples

discovery:
 One service is created for each application running inside an Jolokia
 instance sent by the agent.
