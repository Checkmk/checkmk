description:
 This check allows to monitor the number of current connections to
 a JVM application on the servlet level)

 To use this plugin, Jolokia and the agent plugin need to be deployed
 on the monitored server in each application container.

 The check can alert if the {WARN}/{CRIT} thresholds for a configurable total
 is exceeded.

item:
 The name of the application server instance as configured by the agent
 followed by the name of the application and the servlet inside it.
 I.e. webservices webservices jolokia
 This name is probably dependant on running a loadbalanced install or not.

discovery:
 One service is created for each selvet running inside a weblogic
 instance sent by the agent.
