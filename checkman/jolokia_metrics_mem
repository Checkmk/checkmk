description:

 This check is deprecated and has been replaced by the plugin
 {jolokia_jvm_memory}.

 This check allows to monitor the usage of heap and non-heap memory area
 usage on web application servers.

 To use this plugin, Jolokia and the agent plugin need to be installed
 on the monitored server.
 It will then fetch the memory usage from the JMX status info of the remote
 Java Virtual Machine.

 The check can alert if the {WARN}/{CRIT} thresholds for a configurable heap, nonheap
 or total is exceeded.

item:
 The name of the application server instance as configured by the agent.

discovery:
 One service is created for each Jolokia instance sent by the agent.
