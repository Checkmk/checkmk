description:
 Checks the BGP status for the connection to one peer at Juniper Routers.

 If the operational status (jnxBgpM2PeerStatus) is not {running} it returns
 {WARN} - that means: The connection has probably been shutdown manually.
 If the operational status is {running} it looks for the state of the
 connection (jnxBgpM2PeerState). On {established} it returns {OK} and {CRIT}
 on every other.

item:
 The remote BGP peer's FSM state.

discovery:
 One service is created for each BGP connection reported by SNMP.
