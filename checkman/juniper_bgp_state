 {WARN} - that means: The connection has probably been shutdown manually.
 If the operational status is {running} it looks for the state of the
 connection (jnxBgpM2PeerState). On {established} it returns {OK} and {CRIT}
 on every other.

item:
 The remote BGP peer's FSM state.

inventory:
 One service is created for each BGP connection reported by SNMP.
