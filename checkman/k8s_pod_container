 This check and the associated special agent (agent_kubernetes) are deprecated
 and will be removed in Checkmk version 2.2.0.

 Please configure the new special agent using the "Kubernetes" ruleset.

 This check monitors the number of containers of a pod.
 If containers terminated with a non-zero exit code, then
 the check is {CRIT}, otherwise is is OK.

 The check returns the number of ready over total
 containers, and the number of running, waiting, and
 terminated containers.

 To account for the initial setup of the container or the
 switch of a Pod from one to another the ruleset
 {Maximum number of check attempts for service} should be
 used.

discovery:
 One service is created for each pod.
