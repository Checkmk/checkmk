description:
 This check and the associated special agent (agent_kubernetes) are deprecated
 and will be removed in Checkmk version 2.2.0.

 Please configure the new special agent using the "Kubernetes" ruleset.

 This check monitors the number of replicas in a Kubernetes deployment.
 The state of the check is dependent on the configuration of the deployment
 in Kubernetes.

 If a deployment is paused or defined with the strategy "Recreate" the
 check will always return {OK}. If a deployment uses the strategy
 "RollingUpdate" the check will return {CRIT} if the number of ready replicas
 falls below the maximum unavailable limit or rises above the max surge
 limit.

 The maximum unavailable and maximum surge limits of Kubernetes can be
 either absolute or in percent. Surge levels in percent are rounded up and
 unavailable levels are rounded down. Even a definition of mixed levels
 is possible. If e.g. 10 replicas are expected and max unavailable is 1
 and max surge is 25% the check will return {CRIT} if the number of
 is below 9 or raises above 13 replicas, respectively.

 One service is created.
