 This check and the associated special agent (agent_kubernetes) are deprecated
 and will be removed in Checkmk version 2.2.0.

 Please configure the new special agent using the "Kubernetes" ruleset.

 This check monitors the requested memory as well as the memory limits and capacity
 of a Kubernetes entity. If at least one container running on a node does not specify
 limits, the node has no applicable limits.

 The check returns {OK} if the used Memroy is below 90%. Below 95% {WARN}
 is returned and otherwise {CRIT}. Custom levels can be defined in WATO.
