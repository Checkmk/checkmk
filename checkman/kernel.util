title: CPU Utilization
agents: linux
catalog: os/kernel
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors both the total CPU utilization and the utilization of single cores.
 The total utilization is further split into utilization by the system, by the user and
 disk (IO) wait.

 By default, the check is always {OK}. This behavior can be changed using the rule "CPU
 utilization on Linux/UNIX". Here, you can set levels on the total utilization, on the IO
 wait and also on the single-core utilization.

 Furthermore, this rule also allows for configuring the check to monitor the averaged CPU
 utilization (both for the total and single-core utilizations). The time range over which
 the average is calculated can be set by the user.

inventory:
 One service is created if the agent contains a {kernel} section with CPU information.
