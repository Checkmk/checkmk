description:
 This check monitors various counters as found in {/proc/stat}
 and {/proc/vmstat}. Examples for those counters are {ctxt}
 (the number of process context switches per second), {pgmajfault}
 (the number of major page faults per second), {processes}
 (the number of process creations per second), {pswpin}
 (the number of written swap pages to disk) and {pswpout}
 (the number of read swap pages from disk).

 You can set a critical and warning level on each of those
 counters or just monitor them without levels in order to
 collect performance data. Levels you set to {None} will not
 be checked. For {Page Swap In} and {Page Swap Out}
 both upper and lower levels can be set.

inventory:
 One service is created for {"Major Page Faults"}, {"Context Switches"},
 {"Process Creations"}, {"Page Swap In"} and {"Page Swap Out"} on each host.
