agents: kubernetes

description:
 The connection status to the Kubernetes API is implicitly reported by the
 Checkmk service. This service has a similar function in terms of the
 connection to the Cluster Collector deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.

 The service has three tasks. It reports on the metadata of the
 collectors that are deployed to the Kubernetes cluster and also provides reports
 on the data processing of the collected data. It displays additional information
 in case a problem occurs during the data handling process within the agent.
 Moreover, the service uses the Kubernetes API to report on the status of
 DaemonSets belonging to node collectors. For each node collector the following
 are reported

 - the number of Nodes with a Pod, which is available and desired

 - the number of Nodes, on which a Pod is desired

 The DaemonSets are identified by the labels "node-collector=machine-sections"
 and "node-collector=container-metrics". The service reports an OK state regardless of
 the data process outcome and the API data.

discovery:
 One service is created if the cluster collector option is configured.
