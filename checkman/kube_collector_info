agents: kubernetes
catalog: containerization/kubernetes

distribution: check_mk
description:
 The connection status to the Kubernetes API is implicitly reported by the
 Checkmk service. This service has a similar function in terms of the
 connection to the Cluster Collector deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.

 The service has two tasks. It reports on the metadata of the
 collectors that are deployed to the Kubernetes cluster and also provides reports
 on the data processing of the collected data. It displays additional information
 in case a problem occurs during the data handling process within the agent.
 The service reports an OK state regardless of the data process outcome.

discovery:
 One service is created if the cluster collector option is configured.
