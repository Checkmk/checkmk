description:
 This check shows the CPU usage of a Kubernetes object, its requests utilization and its limits
 utilization.

 Requests utilization is the CPU usage divided by the sum of all configured container CPU
 requests. Limits utilization is computed in the same manner. The utilization percentage values are
 omitted if any of the associated request/limit value are not configured. Moreover, limits
 utilization is omitted if any container has a limit of zero. The reason for omission is displayed
 in the check's details.

 The service includes metrics for the CPU usage, the requests utilization, the limits utilization,
 the CPU requests and CPU limits of the Kubernetes object.

 There are no default thresholds for this service. However, thresholds can be configured via the
 "Kubernetes CPU resource utilization" ruleset.

 The check requires that the special agent kube is configured.

discovery:
 One service is created per Kubernetes object.
