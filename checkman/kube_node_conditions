description:
 A node's status depends on an array of NodeConditions, each with a status
 defined as either "True", "False" or "Unknown". This check monitors the
 status of each condition.

 Statuses are OK according to the nature of the condition. Undesired or
 "Unknown" statuses are considered CRIT by default.

 The state mapping for each condition status is configurable.

discovery:
 One service is created for each node.
