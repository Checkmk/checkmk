description:
 This check monitors the state of a Pod's containers and reports their
 'status' attribute and description along with image name and restart
 count.

 All statuses are OK except 'failed' (terminated with an exit code other
 than 0) which is considered CRIT by default.

 The state mapping for a failed status is configurable.

discovery:
 One service is created for each container.
