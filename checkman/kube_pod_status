description:
 This check provides the pod status. The status of a pod consist of a single word summarizing the
 individual statuses of containers as well as the pod phase. Specifically, if a container is faulty,
 then the status corresponds to the reason given by the container. If there is no such container,
 then the status corresponds to the pod phase. If multiple containers meet the criterion, only one
 container is selected for the status message.
 A container is considered faulty, if it is waiting for a reason other than ContainerCreating or
 if it has terminated with a non-zero exit code.

 Moreover, the check provides the age of the status. If a pod remains in an undesired status for
 longer than 5/10 minutes the service goes {WARN}/{CRIT}. This can be configured via the rule
 Kubernetes pod status. Note, the age of the status depends on the time the status was first
 seen by checkmk, not on data provided by the Kubernetes API.

 The check requires that the special agent kube is configured.
discovery:
 One service is created for each pod.
