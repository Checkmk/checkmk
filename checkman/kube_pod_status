description:
 This check provides the Pod status. The status of a Pod consist of a single word summarizing the
 individual statuses of containers as well as the Pod phase. Specifically, if a container is faulty,
 then the status corresponds to the reason given by the container. If there is no such container,
 then the status corresponds to the Pod phase. If multiple containers meet the criterion, only one
 container is selected for the status message.
 A container is considered faulty, if it is waiting for a reason other than ContainerCreating or
 if it has terminated with non-zero exit code. The service is {OK}.

 The check requires that the special agent kube is configured.
discovery:
 One service is created for each Pod.
