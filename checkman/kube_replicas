description:
 This check monitors the number of Kubernetes replicas.

 In the event that the number of ready or up-to-date replicas is below the
 number of desired replicas, the check shows a WARN and CRIT state if this
 persists for more than 5 minutes and 10 minutes respectively.

 It is possible to configure the grace period for each state using the
 "Kubernetes: Replicas" ruleset.

 Please note that replicas may temporarily be in a not ready or out-of-date
 state during the process of an update. It is therefore advised to always have a
 grace period configured.

discovery:
 One service is created for each Kubernetes object which supports replicas.
