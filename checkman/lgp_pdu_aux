description:
 This check monitors connected Power Distribution (PDU) Auxiliary (AUX) sensors
 provided by Liebert MPH/MPX devices using SNMP. The check has been developed
 using a Network Power Rack PDU Card with temperature, humidity and door sensors.

 This check monitors devices which support the {.1.3.6.1.4.1.476.1.42.3.8.60.15} ({lgpPduAuxMeasTable})
 table in the {LIEBERT-GP-PDU-MIB}.

 The lower and upper thresholds configured in the device are read from the device
 and used for warning/critical states.

 One service is created for each AUX device.

 An item is created using one of the labels TEMP, HUM, DOOR, CONTACT and the internal
 aux sensor index.
