description:
 This checks retrieves various performance data of an OMD monitoring core
 by using MK Livestatus. This data tells you mainly about the performance
 of the core, the number of checks it executes per second and so on.

 Its second task is to determine whether some settings have been disabled
 (e.g. notifications). Which disabled setting leads to which state can
 be configured via check parameters.

item:
 The name of the OMD site.

inventory:
 One service is created for each running OMD site.

cluster:
 On a cluster we aggregate over all node results -- but we
 expect to only get data from the active node.
 Note that the plugin will not warn you if more than one
 node sends data.
