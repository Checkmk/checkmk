agents: linux

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check checks the current state of a Linux bonding interface.
 If the total bonding state of the interface is down, then the
 check gets critical. If at least one slave interface is down
 or not the expected slave is currently active, then the check
 gets WARN.

 If the bonding mode is according to IEEE 802.3ad (Dynamic link
 aggregation), the aggregation IDs are compared. A missmatch
 results in the configured state (default WARN).
