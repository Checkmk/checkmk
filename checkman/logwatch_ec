description:
 This check processes the output of agents with the logwatch plugin. The windows agent has built
 in this extension. Per default this check forwards any data to the Checkmk Event Console.
 With additional configuration the messages can be reclassified to a different state via
 logwatch patterns before they are forwarded to the Event Console.

discovery:
 One service {"Log Forwarding"} is created on each host when the option
 {logwatch_forward_to_ec} is set to {True}.

cluster:
 In a cluster setup all messages are aggregated across the nodes.
