description:
 Monitors the status of an array of an LSI RAID controller. The Linux
 agent sends information about its state, if the tool {cfggen} is
 available. The check returns OK only if the array is present and
 in {Okay(OKY)} state. An array that has another state or is missing
 results in a critical state.

item:
 The {VolumeID} of the raid array

inventory:
 One service is created for each existing array.
 One service is also created if an array is in a bad state but the service will go {CRIT}.
