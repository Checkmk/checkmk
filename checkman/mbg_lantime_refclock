description:
 This check monitors the reflock state of Meinberg LANTIME clocks supporting the
 MBG-SNMP-MIB::mbgLantime ({1.3.6.1.4.1.5597.3.1}) MIB. The check has been
 developed with a GPS170 M3x lantime V5.30k.

 The check handles the reported state of the refclock, the GPS signal and the number of
 satellites connected to.

 The check raises a {CRITICAL} when the refclock is in a bad state ({notavailable},
 {antennaFaulty} or {antennaShortcircuit}) and a {WARNING} state when the refclock is
 in one of the states {trackingSearching}, {warmBoot} or {coldBoot}.
 The GPS state raises a {CRITICAL} state when {not available} or {not synchronized} is
 reported by the device.
 It also handles a warning/critical threshold for the number of good satellites.

inventory:
 One service is created for each device.
