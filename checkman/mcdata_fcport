title: McData FibreChannel Switches: Traffic and Status of Ports

description:
 This check monitors the operational status, link speed, traffic, frame
 counts, C3 discards and CRC errors of FibreChannel port of McData FC switches.

 This check uses the internal logic of the {if}/{if64} check, so at some places
 the naming conventions are a bit unusual (instead of frames, the check speaks
 of packages, for example). The advantage of this approach is, on the other
 hand, that this check makes use of all interesting features if {if}, such
 as averaging, nice PNP templates, Perf-O-Meters and other stuff.

 Depending on the check parameters this check can go WARN or CRIT when the
 port status changes (i.e. is down), when the link speed changes (e.g. a
 port expected to be set to 2GBit/s operates only at 1GBit/s), when the
 absolute or procentual traffic of a port exceeds certain levels or if the
 rate of errors or discards exceeds configurable limits.

 This check supports averaging the in- and outgoing traffic over a configurable
 range of time by using an exponentially weighted moving average - just as
 Linux does for the CPU load averages.  The averaging can be configured on
 a per host and per port base. This is done by adding a key {"average"}
 to the parameter dictionary with the number of minutes that the average
 should cover as its key. Port with averaging turned on output two additional
 performance values: the averaged traffic in bytes. If you have configured
 traffic levels, then those levels are applied to the averaged values.

item:
 The port index as two digit string, for example {"03"} or {"24"}. The first
 port has the number {"01"}.

inventory:
 The inventory creates one service for each port that fulfills configurable conditions.
 Per default these are ports which are currently found {up} and are of types {6} (ethernetCsmacd),
 {32} (frameRelay) or {117} (gigabitEthernet). This check announces the port
 type of {6} for the FC ports. This is not exactly correct but makes the inventory
 find the FC ports without further configuration.

 {Grouping:} In some situations you do not want to monitor a single
 interface but a group of interfaces that together form a pool.
 The {if} check supports such pools by defining groups.
 You can specifiy the members of a group by their port type and the item name(s) of
 the single interfaces. The data of all members is accumulated and put together
 in a single grouped interface service.

 You can specify the groups with the ruleset {if_groups}.
 Groups are defined as list of dictionaries.

 The keys are:

  {"name"}:   String. Name of the group within the service description

  {"iftype"}: Integer. Interface port type as integer

  {"include_items"}: List of Strings. Interface item name. This name depends
  on further settings like if_inventory_uses_alias or if_inventory_uses_description

  {"single"}(optional): Bool. Interfaces in this group do not show up
  as single service if "single" is set to True (Default: False)

  For example: if_groups = ([{"name" : "Group WLAN", "iftype" : 6, "single" : True}], ["lan"], ALL_HOSTS )

examples:
 Definition for grouped interfaces
 if_groups = [
   ( [{"name" : "VLAN", "iftype" : 53, "single" : True },
      {"name" : "voiceDID", "iftype" : 213}], [], ALL_HOSTS ),
   ( [{ "name" : "Group WLAN", "iftype" : 6, "single" : True }], [ "lan" ], ALL_HOSTS )
 ]
