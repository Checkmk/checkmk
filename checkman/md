description:
 Checks the current state of a Linux MD raid array. The information
 is read by the agent from {/proc/mdstat}. The result is either
 OK, if all disks are active or critical in any other case.

item:
 The Linux raid device without {/dev/}, for example {"md0"}.

inventory:
 One service is created for each RAID device unless it is a RAID-Level 0 architecture.
 The RAID-Level 0 devices's output is completely different from the others.
