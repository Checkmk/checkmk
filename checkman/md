description:
 Checks the current state of a Linux MD raid array. The information
 is read by the agent from {/proc/mdstat}. The result is either
 OK, if all disks are active or critical in any other case.

item:
 The Linux raid device without {/dev/}, for example {"md0"}.

inventory:
 All RAID devices except those with raid level 0 are automatically detected.
 The RAID 0 devices's output is completely different from the others.
 And if a disk crashes you will soon notice anyway...
