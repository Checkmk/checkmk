title: LSI MegaRAID: State of Physical Disks (via MegaCLI)
agents: linux
catalog: os/storage
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the state of the physical disks of an LSI
 MegaRAID Controller. The Linux agent sends the neccessary data,
 if the command line utility {MegaCli} is found in the shells
 search path. The usual way is to install it into {/usr/local/bin}.

 The utility {MegaCli} can be downloaded from
 {http://www.lsi.com/downloads/Public/MegaRAID%20Common%20Files/8.02.16_MegaCLI.zip}.
 This is an alternative to the utility {cfggen}. {cfggen} only works
 with the driver {mptsas}, whereas {MegaCli} uses a device created
 by the driver {megaraid_sas}.

item:
 A combination of the enclosure and the slot number, separated by a slash, for
 example {"0/4"} for enclosure {0} and slot {4}.

inventory:
 One service is created for each disk.
