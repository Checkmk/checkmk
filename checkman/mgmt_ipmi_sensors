description:
 This check uses the information of sensors provided via IPMI. The current
 management board monitoring reports states about all available fans,
 temperature sensors and power supplies.

 Note that IPMI provides four states: 'ok', 'non-critical', 'critical' and
 'non-recoverable'. The default Check-MK behaviour is to map 'ok' to {OK},
 'non-critical' to {WARN} and 'critical' and 'non-recoverable' to {CRIT}.
 However, some manufacturers choose to display both 'ok' and 'non-critical'
 as normal on their provided tools. If you want Check-MK to behave similarly,
 you can set up a corresponding "Service State Translation" rule.

item:
 The name of the sensor as provided via IPMI.

inventory:
 All sensors that are reported by the management board of a host via IPMI
 are automatically inventorized.
