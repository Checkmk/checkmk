description:
 This check monitors the {msg}, {rollovers}, {regular}, {warning}
 and {user} assert rate of a MongoDB instance. Without further configuration
 this check is always OK.

 Note: If the MongoDB is running as a replica set, this check is not discovered
 on the same host where the {mk_mongodb} plugin is installed. The data is piggybacked
 to a pseudo host named after the replica set name, intead.

discovery:
 One service is created.
