agents: linux

license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the number of current connections to the MongoDB instance.
 You can configure levels for the absolute / percentage amount of connections.
 The default values are set to 80%/90% of available connections.
 This check also shows the connection rate which is derived from the number
 of total connections.

 Note: If the MongoDB is running as a replica set, this check is not discovered
 on the same host where the {mk_mongodb} plugin is installed. The data is piggybacked
 to a pseudo host named after the replica set name, intead.

item:
 The fixed statement {{Connections}}

discovery:
 One service is created.
