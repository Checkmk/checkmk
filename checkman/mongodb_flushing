title: MongoDB Flushing
agents: linux
catalog: app/mongodb
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This checks monitors time how long MongoDB needs
 to write the data to disk. You can configure levels for the
 average flush time and the last_flush time. Without further
 configuration this check is always OK.

 Note: If the MongoDB is running as a replica set, this check is not discovered
 on the same host where the {mk_mongodb} plugin is installed. The data is piggybacked
 to a pseudo host named after the replica set name, intead.

perfdata:
 The avergage flush over the configured interval, the last flush
 time, the number of flushes since restart and the average flush
 time since restart.
