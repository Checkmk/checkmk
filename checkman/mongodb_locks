title: MongoDB: Locks
agents: linux
catalog: app/mongodb
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the number of read, write and total locks
 for the active clients and queued operations on a MongoDB instance.
 You can configure levels for the read, write and total count.
 Without configuration this check is always OK.

 Note: If the MongoDB is running as a replica set, this check is not discovered
 on the same host where the {mk_mongodb} plugin is installed. The data is piggybacked
 to a pseudo host named after the replica set name, intead.

discovery:
 One service is created.
