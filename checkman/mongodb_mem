title: MongoDB: Memory
agents: linux
catalog: app/mongodb
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the amount of resident, virtual and mapped memory
 for a mongodb instance. You can configure levels for each object.
 Furthermore this check validates if the virtual memory is much higher (3 times)
 than the mapped memory. This indicates a possible memory leak
 in the database. The check reports WARN in this scenario.

 Note: If the MongoDB is running as a replica set, this check is not discovered
 on the same host where the {mk_mongodb} plugin is installed. The data is piggybacked
 to a pseudo host named after the replica set name, intead.

inventory:
 One service is created.
