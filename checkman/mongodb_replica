description:
 This check shows the primary, secondary and arbiter hosts from a MongoDB cluster.

 If the replica set does not have a primary node, the check will report a warning.

 Note: If the MongoDB is running as a replica set, this check is not discovered
 on the same host where the {mk_mongodb} plugin is installed. The data is piggybacked
 to a pseudo host named after the replica set name instead.

inventory:
 One service is created.
