description:
 This check monitors if the primary of a replica set changed.

 Replica sets can trigger an election in response to:

 - adding a new node to the replica set

 - initiating a replica set

 - performing replica set maintenance using methods such as rs.stepDown() or rs.reconfig()

 - secondary members losing connectivity to the primary for more than the configured timeout (10 seconds by default).
