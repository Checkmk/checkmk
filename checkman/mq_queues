description:
 This check monitors the length of ActiveMQ Queues. ActiveMQ is a
 popular and powerful open source messaging and integration patterns server.
 To get the queue data, you have to configure the special agent: agent_activemq
 for querying the information from the server. This can be done easily with
 wato -> Datasource Programs. Its also possible to run the agent in piggyback mode.
 With this mode you can use the piggybag hostname translation to translate the queue names
 into server names so you can allocate the queues to multipe servers.

 After setting up the agent, it is possible to set Warning and Critical levels for the current
 size of each queue. The check also returns an {Critical} state if the length of the consumerCount is 0.
 If the queue is a Death Letter queue (DLQ) you should prevent this behavior by setting levels for it.

item:
 The name of the queue

discovery:
 One service is created for each queue.
