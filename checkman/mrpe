title: MRPE: MK's Remote Plugin Executor
agents: linux, aix, solaris, hpux, macosx, netbsd, openbsd, freebsd
catalog: generic
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 The MRPE is a simple and efficient way to use standard Nagios
 Plugins with the {check_mk_agent} and thus emulate NRPE to
 a certain degree. Its main usage is to allow a soft migration
 from NRPE to check_mk and to use third party Nagios plugins
 that are running locally on your target hosts.

 This check type processes the MRPE section in the output of the
 agent. Since
 all levels and parameters are configured on the target host,
 no parameters are needed here. Please refer to the online
 documentation on how to configure the agent.

 The current version of the {mrpe} check is now cluster-aware
 and works well as a {clustered_service} (see article about
 Checkmk cluster monitoring). If an MRPE check is found on
 more than one node, then the best status of the checks is
 being used. So if the check is critical on one of the nodes
 and OK on another then the status, output and performance
 data of the OK check is being used as the gross result of the check.

item:
 The service description of the check as configured in {mrpe.cfg}
 on the target host.

discovery:
 One service is created for each plugins configured in {mrpe.cfg}.
