description:
 This check monitors the time of the last successful backup
 of MSSQL tablespaces reported by MSSQL.

 For each backup type you can set levels to raise alerts if the last successful
 backup is too long ago.

 The check has been developed with MSSQL Server 2008 R2 but should
 work with other versions too.

 This check needs the Checkmk mssql.vbs -plugin installed in
 the agent. Please refer to the online documentation
 for how to install that plugin.

item:
 The MSSQL instance name and the tablespace name separated by a space.

discovery:
 One service is created for each tablespace.
