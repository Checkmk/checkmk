 This check monitors the time of the last successful backup

 is too long ago.

 The check has been developed with MSSQL Server 2008 R2 but should
 work with other versions too.

 This check needs the Checkmk mssql.vbs -plugin installed in
 the agent. Please refer to the online documentation
 for how to install that plugin.

 The MSSQL instance name, the tablespace name separated by a space
 and the backup type.

 One service is created for each backup type for every instance.
