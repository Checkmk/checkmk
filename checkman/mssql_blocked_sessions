title: MSSQL Blocked Sessions
agents: windows
catalog: app/mssql
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check lists all blocked sessions on a MSSQL Server. As
 long at least one session is blocked, it will be {CRITICAL}.
 This state is configurable with a default value of {CRITICAL}.

 Alternatively you can configure thresholds for the SQL output
 "wait_duration_ms".

 These two options can {not} be combined. If thresholds are set,
 they will have precedence.

 This check needs the Check_MK mssql.vbs -plugin installed in
 the agent. Please refer to the online documentation
 for how to install that plugin.

 One check per host will be created
