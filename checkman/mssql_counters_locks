title: MS SQL Tablespaces: Locks per Second
agents: windows
catalog: app/mssql
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors locking related information of MSSQL tablespaces
 like for example the number of deadlocks per second or lock requests.
 Upper levels for each element can be configured in Wato.

 The check has been developed with MSSQL Server 2008 R2 but should
 work with other versions too.

 This check needs the Checkmk mssql.vbs plugin installed in
 the agent. Please refer to the online documentation
 for how to install that plugin.

item:
 The MSSQL instance name and the tablespace name separated by a space.

inventory:
 One service is created for each tablespace.

cluster:
 On a cluster the check just cumulates all results for each cluster node.
 The overall result state then reflects the worst state of all nodes.
