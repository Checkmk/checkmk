description:
 This check monitors the read/write/lookup activities on database pages of
 the MSSQL server.
 Upper levels for each element can be configured in Wato.

 This check needs the Checkmk mssql.vbs -plugin installed in
 the agent. Please refer to the online documentation
 for how to install that plugin.

item:
 The MSSQL instance name and the tablespace name separated by a space.

inventory:
 One service is created for each instance.

cluster:
 On a cluster the check just cumulates all results for each cluster node.
 The overall result state then reflects the worst state of all nodes.
