description:
 This check monitors the general state of MSSQL server processes
 and outputs some information like the version number and edition.

 When the connection to the database instance fails, the check reports
 that by changing to {CRIT}.

 The check has been developed with MSSQL Server 2008 R2 but should
 work with other versions too.

 This check needs the Checkmk mssql.vbs plugin installed in
 the agent. Please refer to the online documentation
 for how to install that plugin.

item:
 The instance ID of the MSSQL server process instance.

inventory:
 One service is created for each server process.
