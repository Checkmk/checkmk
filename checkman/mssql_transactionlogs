title: MS SQL: Size of Transaction Logs
agents: windows
catalog: app/mssql
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the size of transaction logs in MSSQL.
 Levels can be set for the usage relative to the maximum size,
 relative to the currently allocated size and for the currently
 allocated size itself.

 This check needs the Checkmk mssql.vbs -plugin installed in
 the agent. Please refer to the online documentation
 for how to install that plugin.

item:
 A combination of the instance-, database- and (logical) file-name.

inventory:
 One service is created for each transactionlog.
 Alternatively there is a rule to summarize logs for each database.
 In this case one summary service is created for each database.

cluster:
 On a cluster we aggregate over all node results -- but we
 expect to only get data from the active node.
 Note that the plugin will not warn you if more than one
 node sends data.
