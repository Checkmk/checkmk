title: State of Multipathing on Linux

description:
 This check monitors the state of multipath devices on Linux
 hosts. For each multipath device at time of inventory the number
 of paths is put into the check parameters. If later the number
 of paths is less then expected, the check goes critical. So it
 does if any of the paths is broken.

 If the number of paths is higher than expected, the check goes
 warning. A reinventory of the check might be neccessary in that
 case.

 This check is based on the output of the command {multipath -l} as
 sent by the Linux agent. It correctly deals with various subtle
 differences between the available versions of the multipath tools.

item:
 The UUID of the multipath device, e.g. {"360a980004334644d654a364469555a76"}.
 Via {inventory_multipath_rules} you can specify wether an alias should be used
 as item instead of the UUID. If the multipath device has an alias the alias will
 be used as item.

inventory:
 One service is created for each multipath device.
