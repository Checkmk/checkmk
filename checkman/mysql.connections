 This check allows the tracking of connection usage for a MySQL database.
 Therefore it queries the maximum number of connections that have been
 in use simultaneously since the server started and
 the maximum number of possible parallel connections.
 From these both it calculates the
 maximum usage level of these connections in percent
 and matches the specified {WARN} and {CRIT} thresholds against it.

 This check needs the agent plugin {mk_mysql} to be installed.
 Further details about this plugin and monitoring of MySQL can be
 found in the Checkmk online documentation in the article
 "Monitoring MySQL with Checkmk".
