title: MySQL: IO Statistics of InnoDB Engine
agents: linux

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check tracks the IO rate of the InnoDB database
 engine for MySQL.
 The data is gathered from the {show global status} query.

 It allows you plan IO device capacity by seeing how much
 is read and written by InnoDB, or to proactively generate alerts if
 something is generating far too much write IO.
 The configuration of this check is internally done as a "disk check" but
 presented in as an application monitoring in WATO.

 The check is configured like the {diskstat} check for block devices.

item:
 The name of the instance

inventory:
 One service is created for each instance
 representing the InnoDB writers for a MySQL Daemon.
