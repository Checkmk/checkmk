description:
 This check verifies the space used by MySQL databases as
 returned from MySQL. The information is built by summing up
 the space for indices and tables of a given database.

 It relies on the information returned from MySQL, which can be incorrect
 as MySQL does not always account for all database information.

 In practice, the check works well for {InnoDB}.
 This should even include InnoDB on raw partitions.

 {MyISAM} reporting is not possible as MySQL does not make the
 data available. (See the dirsize checks as a workaround should you
 really use MyISAM)

 The check will go to {WARN} or {CRIT} levels if a user-specified
 limit is exceeded.

item:
 Name of the instance and name of the database seperated by a colon ({{:}})

discovery:
 One service is created for each database.
 Internal MySQL databases are ignored.
