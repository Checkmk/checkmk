title: Size of MySQL tablespaces
agents: linux
catalog: app/mysql
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check verifies the space used by MySQL databases as
 returned from MySQL. The information is built by summing up
 the space for indices and tables of a given database.

 It relies on the information returned from MySQL, which can be incorrect
 as MySQL does not always account for all database information.

 In practice, the check works well for {InnoDB}.
 This should even include InnoDB on raw partitions.

 {MyISAM} reporting is not possible as MySQL does not make the
 data available. (See the dirsize checks as a workaround should you
 really use MyISAM)

 The check will go to {WARN} or {CRIT} levels if a user-specified
 limit is exceeded.

inventory:
 The check generates one item per Database found.
 Internal MySQL databases are ignored.

perfdata:
  The current size of the database, and {WARN} and {CRIT} levels if they
  are set.

examples:
  # Configure a WARN / CRIT level of 100GB / 200GB for all systems.
  check_parameters += [
    ((100000, 300000), ALL_HOSTS, [ "MySQL DB.*Size" ]),
  ]

[parameters]
warn(int): warning level for the database size in MB
crit(int): critical level for the dataase size in MB
