title: NetApp Filer: Used Space of qtrees in Volumes
agents: netapp
catalog: hw/storagehw/netapp

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check measures the disk usage of qtrees. The usage
 is checked against a warning and a critical level, which
 can be specified in numerous ways.

 {Trends:} This checks supports aggregation {trends}. This means that the {netapp_api_qtree_quota} check
 is able to compute the {change} of the used space over the time and can
 make a forecast into the future. It can estimate the time when
 the aggregation will be full.

 In the default configuration the check will compute the trend based on the
 data of the last 24 hours using a logarithmic average that gives more recent
 data a higher weight. Also data beyond the 24 hours will to some small degree be
 reflected in the computation. The advantage of this algorithm is a more
 precise prediction and a simpler implementation, which does not need any
 access to any RRDs or similar storage.

 Please note that when a aggregation is started to be monitored,
 the trend of the past is unknown and is assumed to be {zero}.
 It will take at least one trend range of time until the trend
 approximately reflects the reality.

item:
 Name of the qtree as defined in the system

inventory:
 One service is created for each qtree with the quota-type {tree}.
 {User} and {group} quota types are not shown.
