description:
 This check monitors the CPU utilization (in percent) of a vFiler in a 7Mode
 environment. By default, the check goes WARN if the utilization exceeds 90%
 and CRIT if it exceeds 95%. Custom levels can be configured using the rule
 "CPU utilization of Devices with Modules".

 Furthermore, the check can also be configured to compute an averaged CPU
 utilization. The time range over which the average is computed can be set by
 the user. If averaging is activated, the levels will be applied to the averaged
 utilization.
