description:
 This check monitors the high availability status of Citrix Netscaler
 Loadbalacing Appliances operating in a cluster setup. It uses snmp and the
 NS-ROOT-MIB to access the {haPeerState}, {haCurStatus} and {haCurState}
 OIDs from the nsHighAvailabilityGroup.

 The check is in the state OK when the system is not setup for ha, or
 {haCurState} is up/funtional. It is in the state WARN when the system is
 manually configured not to participate in a HA cluster, or initializing to
 become a cluster member, or when {haCurState} is {monitorFAIL}, {monitorOK},
 or {unkown} because these states are not documented in the MIB. It is
 critical in other states {haCurState} can be.

inventory:
 One service is created for each host.
