 This check validates found SSL certificates against {WARN} and {CRIT} levels.

 Levels default to {(30, 10)} days but can be customized by the WATO rule
 {Citrix Netscaler SSL certificates}.

item:
 The name reported as {sslCertKeyName} (OID: .1.3.6.1.4.1.5951.4.1.1.56.1.1.1).

inventory:
 Per default one service is discovered for each found SSL certificate.

 Use {ignored_services} if you need a host-specific configuration of the
 inventory.
