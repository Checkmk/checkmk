description:
 This check monitors the status of the VServers of Citrix Netscaler
 Loadbalacing Appliances. It uses snmp and the NS-ROOT-MIB to access the data.
 Also request rate, received and transmitted byte rates are reported.

 The check is in the state OK when the VServer is in the state {UP}. It is in the
 state CRIT when the VServer is in the state {DOWN}. It is in the state WARN in
 all other cases.

 For loadbalancing entities, the check also shows the health state. It goes WARN
 and CRIT if the health drops below configurable levels (WATO rule "Netscaler VServer
 States"). The default levels are 100% and 0.1%.

inventory:
 One service is created for each VServer.

item:
 The name of the VServer.

cluster:
 On a cluster, by default, the check reports the best state across all cluster nodes.
 The check can also be configured to report the individual states of the nodes, s.t.
 the overall state corresponds to the worst individual state. Furthermore, the check
 reports the highest request rate and the highest received and transmitted byte rates
 across all nodes. Finally, if the first node is a loadbalancing entity, the check
 also monitors the health state of this entity.
