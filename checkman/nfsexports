description:

 This check validates NFS exports on a NFS file server.  It looks at exports
 defined both in {/etc/exports} (classic way) or exports that are defined
 using {exportfs} by a cluster management software.  It uses the native NFS
 toolset for queriying this information and notices errors in the NFS server
 daemons or portmapper.

 If you want to use this check then you will have to install the appropriate
 agent plugin.

item:
 The name of the NFS export, which is the name of the exported filesystem.

inventory:
 One service is created for each NFS export.
 This is done using showmount -e (not /proc).
