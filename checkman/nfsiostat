description:
 This check monitors the performance of NFS mounts on client systems by way of
 the nfsiostat command. This requires the nfs-utils (Red Hat) or nfs-common
 (Debian) packages to be installed.
 It monitors every nfs mount point found and provides the following metrics:
 operations per second, rpc backlog, read/write: operations per second, bytes per
 second, bytes per operation, retransmissions (%), average RTT (ms) and average
 exe (ms).

item:
 Name of the NFS mount

inventory:
 One service is created for each NFS mount.
