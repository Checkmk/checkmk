description:

 This check monitors the latency of read IO operations. The total reads will
 always be displayed. Additionally read IO latency groups will be displayed
 if the counter is greater than a given threshold. The state will change
 accordingly to the defined threshold.

 Thresholds and correlating states can be defined for each latency group.

inventory:
 One services for each volume will be created.
