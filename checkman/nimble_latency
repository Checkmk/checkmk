description:

 This check monitors the latency of read IO operations. This is shown as the
 number of read IO operations as a percentage of total read IO operations within
 a particular latency range. A latency range is a range of time intervals,
 e.g. 0-0.1 ms, 0.1-0.2 ms, etc.

 Thresholds for WARN and CRIT states can be defined, along with the starting
 range from which the levels are relevant. For example, show a WARN if 10% of
 overall read IO operations have a latency of 10-20 ms or above, and CRIT if 20%
 of overall read IO operations reach this threshold. The corresponding ruleset
 for these thresholds is named "Nimble IO levels".
