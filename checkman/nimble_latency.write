description:

 This check monitors the latency of write IO operations. The total writes will
 always be displayed. Additionally write IO latency groups will be displayed
 if the counter is greater than a given threshold. The state will change
 accordingly to the defined threshold.

 Thresholds and correlating states can be defined for each latency group.
