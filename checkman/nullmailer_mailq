 This check monitors the number of deferred mails in the outgoing mail

 of the Checkmk agent the number of mails in the failed queue is monitored
 as well.

 This check creates one service per host which represents the state
 of the outgoing mailqueue.

 The check will result in {WARNING} or {CRITICAL} if the number of mails
 in the deferred queue have reached the defined thresholds.
 By default the check will result in {CRITICAL} if there is at least one failed mail.
