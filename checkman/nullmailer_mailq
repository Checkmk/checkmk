 This check creates one service per host which represents the state
 of the outgoing mailqueue.

 The check will result in {WARNING} or {CRITICAL} if the number of mails
 in the deferred queue have reached the defined thresholds.
 By default the check will result in {CRITICAL} if there is at least one failed mail.
