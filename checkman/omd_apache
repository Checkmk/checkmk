description:
 This check creates statistics about the requests handled by the apache
 webserver running in OMD sites. It records the number of requests,
 bytes sent and time needed for processing the requests. These statistics
 are grouped by type of the request, for example Checkmk Views, NagVis
 AJAX calls, but also by type e.g. for images, stylesheets etc.

 The check uses a specific log file which must be located at
 {var/log/apache/stats} to gather the access statistics. This file will
 be truncated each time it has been checked.

item:
 The name of the site.

inventory:
 One service is created for each site.
