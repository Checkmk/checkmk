description:
 Monitors the disk usage of a site. This tool helps experts to detect
 anomalies. We currently monitor the following directories:

 - var/log/ - Logging files. Increasing the logging levels can cause this
   directory to grow rapidly.

 - tmp/ - Temporary and runtime files, for example piggyback data and report files. If
   there is too much data here, it can indicate an issue.

 - local/ - Customizations such as custom checks, MKPs, notification scripts
   and many more. Large amounts of data in this directory can slow down
   activate changes in distributed environments.

 - var/check_mk/agents/ - Baked agent files and related temporary files.

 - var/check_mk/core/ - The current monitoring state alongside the full
   monitoring history. The data here can impact monitoring performance.

 - var/pnp4nagios/ - PNP graphs stored in an old format, which is no longer
   used. An increase in disk usage can indicate a problem with the graphing.

 The following directories give insight into the state of the site. There
 are no direct actions to be taken or consequences for monitoring.

 - var/check_mk/rrd/ - Modern graphing data.

 - var/mkeventd/history/ - Contains archived events from the Event Console.

 - var/check_mk/inventory_archive/ - A cache of the HW/SW Inventory data.
