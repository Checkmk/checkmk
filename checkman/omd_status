description:
 This check checks the status of OMD sites found on the system.
 It uses the output of {omd status --bare --auto}. The site is considered
 to be {OK} if all services of the site are running and {CRIT}
 otherwise. If the site is only partially running then the check output
 shows the names of the stopped services.

 The check also works in a cluster environment, listing all node where the
 sites are running on and their states. The total state of the service is
 then only critical when one of the sites on a node is partially running,
 or when all sites on the nodes are stopped.

item:
 The name of the site (string).

inventory:
 One check per site will be created for each site where {AUTOSTART} is
 set to {on}, regardless of the current state of the site.
