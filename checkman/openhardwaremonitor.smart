description:
 This checks monitors hard disk health via S.M.A.R.T. as reported by the
 tool OpenHardwareMonitor (http://openhardwaremonitor.org/).
 Please note that OHM reports aggregated S.M.A.R.T. attributes, not raw
 values.
 This check will only pick up on disks where it has support for at least
 one of the reported attributes.
 Currently supported attributes are:

 - Remaining Life

 check_mk includes a stripped down version of OpenHardwareMonitor without
 a gui component which can be installed through the agent backery
 or manually.
 If the check_mks own version of ohm is used and installed correcty,
 the windows agent will ensure it is run (and restarted) as
 necessary.

item:
 The ID of the disk as reported by OpenHardwareMonitor

inventory:
 One service is created for each available sensor with the sensor type ("Level") if
 the sensor reports {"hdd"}.
