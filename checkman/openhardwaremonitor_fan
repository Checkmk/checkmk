description:
 This checks monitors fan speed sensors reported by the tool
 OpenHardwareMonitor (http://openhardwaremonitor.org/). check_mk
 includes a stripped down version of OpenHardwareMonitor without
 a gui component which can be installed through the agent backery
 or manually.
 If the check_mks own version of ohm is used and installed correcty,
 the windows agent will ensure it is run (and restarted) as
 necessary.

 This check has configurable {WARN} and {CRIT} levels but by default
 NO levels are used, because there is no way to discover if the
 fan is even connected and whether fan control may halt it completely.

item:
 The name of the sensor as reported by OpenHardwareMonitor

inventory:
 One service is created for each available sensor with the sensor type ("Fan").
