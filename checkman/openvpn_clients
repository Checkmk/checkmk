title: OpenVPN: Client Connections
agents: linux
catalog: os/networking
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses the status file created by OpenVPN in order
 to check the state of the client connections and also to measure
 the inbound and outbound traffic. The traffic is measured raw -
 i.e. including keepalive packages and headers - not just the payload.

 Currently the linux agent is expecting the status file at
 {/etc/openvpn/openvpn-status.log}. You can specify the path where
 OpenVPN should create this file with the directive {status =} in you
 {openvpn.conf}.

item:
 The name of the OpenVPN connection (first column in the status file).

inventory:
 One service is created for each active connection.
 Please use {ignored_services} if you want to restrict this.
