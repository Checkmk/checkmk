description:
 This check measures the usage of ASM Disk Groups.  The usage
 is checked against a warning and a critical level, which
 can be specified in numerous ways.

 {Requirements:} The agent_plugin {mk_oracle} is needed on the monitored machines.
 See details for mk_oracle at manpage of oracle_instance.
 All Failure Groups need the same size. Otherwise the calculation of
 total and used space is wrong. Disk Groups with Voting require 3 for
 NORMAL and 5 for HIGH Redundancy!

 {Trends:} This checks supports Disk Group {trends}. This means that the
 check is able to compute the change of the used space over the time
 and can make a forecast into the future. It can estimate the time when
 the Disk Group will be full.

 In a default configuration the check will compute the trend based on the
 data of the last 24 hours using a logarithmic average that gives more recent
 data a higher weight. Also data beyond the 24 hours will to some small degree be
 reflected in the computation. The advantage of this algorithm is a more
 precise prediction and a simpler implementation, which does not need any
 access to any RRDs or similar storage.

 Please note that when a Disk Group is started to be monitored,
 the trend of the past is unknown and is assumed to be {zero}.
 It will take at least one trend range of time until the trend
 approximately reflects the reality.

item:
 The name of the disk group as delivered by the agent without the {/} at the
 end.

 See also check manpage for {df}. All configurations are usable for Oracle ASM
 Disk Groups as well.

inventory:
 One service is created for each Disk Group.

cluster:
 If a cluster is configured, the first found node is checked only.
