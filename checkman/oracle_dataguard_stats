description:
 This check monitors the apply and transport lag time
 on an ORACLE database. You can set warn/crit levels in seconds
 for apply lag and transport lag.

 The apply_lag_min is only useful when an apply lag is configured
 in Data Guard. Otherwise the apply lag is 0.

 The init.ora-Parameter log_archive_config must be configured.
 Oracle Enterprise Edition is required for Oracle Data-Guard.

 The Broker and Observer are automatically detected and monitored
 as well.

 The Active Data-Guard Option is an addional license from
 Oracle. When a Standby Datebase is opened READ ONLY and media
 recovery is active, the option is in use and the default state
 is WARN. This can be changed with the parameter
 active_dataguard_option.

 This check needs the Check_MK {mk_oracle}-plugin installed in
 the agent. Please refer to the online documentation
 for how to install that plugin.
