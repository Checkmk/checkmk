title: Oracle Instance: Status of Database
agents: linux, aix, hpux, solaris, windows
distribution: check_mk
catalog: app/oracle
license: GPLv2
description:
 This check monitors the state of an Oracle Instance. The check depends on
 the state of the database.

 The database must be a Primary Database and OPEN (startup in sqlplus) or
 a Physical Standby Database and OPEN or MOUNTED. The state is CRITICAL when
 this is not true.

 The archive logmode, logging option, logins and uptime are also checked:
 the state is WARNING when the Database is in NOARCHIVELOG or in ARCHIVELOG
 and FORCE LOGGING is disabled. The state is CRITICAL when logins are not
 possible.  This behaviour can be changed with rules.  The rule for logins
 is only working when the connection is established with 'sysdba'. Otherwise
 the rule for logins is always CRITICAL.

 This check requires the new agent plugin mk_oracle from our plugin directory.

 You can find a description for a basic configuration below. More details for
 special setups will be available on the homepage of the Checkmk project.
 https://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_oracle.html

 There are two configuration files important and stored in $MK_CONFDIR.
 {sqlnet.ora} is a static file and is essential for the connection to the
 database. It is also used to disable trace. Otherwise the oracle client
 might create a lot of trace data in $HOME of the root user and may fill the
 '/' filesystem.

 Notes about CDB support in mk_oracle:
 All PDBs from CDB change to pending state when CDB is not OPEN, to minimize
 state changes for all instance checks. A '$' is removed in the service name.
 pdb$seed is translated to pdbseed to prevent problems due to '$' in service
 names. The check ignores the fact that the pdb$seed is in read only mode.

 {mk_oracle.cfg} is the main configuration file for the plugin. Most
 importantly, it contains the {credentials} for the connection to the
 database. The ':' is used as a field separator in each line defining
 the credentials. <sysdba>, <Host> and <Port> are optional: per default
 <sysdba> is empty, Host=localhost and Port=1521. Host and Port depends on
 the Listener configuration of the database.  DBUSER is used as a default for
 all Instances on the Host. This default could be replaced for each Instance
 with a DBUSER_<ORACLE_SID> entry. ASMUSER is a special entry for an Oracle
 ASM Instance. ASM needs a 'sysdba' or 'asmsnmp' entry because this instance
 is not OPEN. There is no ASMUSER_<ORACLE_SID> entry!

 ASMUSER=<Username>:<Password>:<sysdba/asmsnmp>:<Host>:<Port>

 DBUSER=<Username>:<Password>:<sysdba>:<Host>:<Port>

 DBUSER_<ORACLE_SID>=<Username>:<Password>:<sysdba>:<Host>:<Port>

 The configuration of a normal Instance is very easy. An example for ASM
 follows afterwards below.

 Example for nen CDB (old) databases:

 sqlplus / as sysdba

 create user check_mk identifiebd by checkmk;

 grant connect, select_catalog_role to check_mk;

 Example for CDB databases:
 The prefix C## is only allowed in CDB environments. Don't use it for old
 databases!

 create user c##check_mk identified by "secret";
 alter  user c##check_mk set container_data=all container = current;
 grant create session, select_catalog_role to c##check_mk container=all;


 An additional grant for a configuration to a Physical Standby Database is
 mandatory when the Standby is not running in OPEN mode.  In most setups,
 the Standby is running in MOUNT state requiring a 'SYSDBA' connection
 due to the closed Data Dictionary. This grant is needed on the Primary as
 well. Otherwise mk_oracle is not able to monitor the Instance after a role
 change on the old Primary.

 non CDB:

 grant sysdba to check_mk;

 CDB:

 grant sysdba to c##check_mk;

 Example for ASM:

 An ASM Instance does not have a data dictionary. This is why a sysdba or
 asmsnmp connection is required. Oracle changed the security in Release 11.1.
 The connection with sqlplus must be carried out with 'as sysasm'. Older
 versions are working like a normal Instance requiring a 'as sysdba'
 connection. There is no requirement to create a new user for mk_oracle.
 You cold use the existent default user asmsnmp.

 sqlplus / as sysasm

 create user check_mk identifiebd by checkmk;

 grant sysdba to check_mk;

 There is no ASM Instance Check at the moment. The configuration is needed
 for the other checks.
