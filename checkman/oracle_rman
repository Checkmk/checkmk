title: Oracle: RMAN Backup Status
agents: linux, aix, hp/ux, Solaris
catalog: app/oracle

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors different types of RMAN Backups.

 The age of
 the last RMAN backup is reported for ARCHIVELOG, CONTROLFILE and
 FULL/INCREMENTAL Backups.
 A rule is required for generating notifications.

 there is a specific behavior for DB_INCR_1. The plugin could miss
 the information for a DB_INCR_1 backup after a delete obsolete in RMAN.
 The check reports the age for the last DB_INCR_0 for this situation.
 This is required for a DB_INCR_0 each monday and a
 DB_INCR_1 on all other days. The delete obsolete after the DB_INCR_0
 could remove all informations for the DB_INCR_1 and the check
 reports a missing backup. This is prevented with this behavior.

 This check needs the Checkmk {mk_oracle}-plugin installed in
 the agent. Please refer to the online documentation
 for how to install that plugin.
