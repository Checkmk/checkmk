description:
 This check monitors the state of Oracle tablespaces. It
 checks the current and maximum size, the online state
 and the autoextension and optionally the setting of
 the increment size.

 {Autoextension}: During inventory the autoextension setting is determined
 and remembered for later.  That means that if the auto extension setting
 changes later, the check will get critical. A table space may consist of
 several data files with different settings.  If at least one data file
 has auto extension turned on, the table space is considered to have auto
 extension turned on. The behaviour of autoextension setting can be configured
 with a check parameter.

 {Increment size}: If the configuration parameter
 {oracle_tablespaces_check_default_increment} is set to
 {True} (which is the default), then the check will warn
 you, if the increment size is set to the Oracle default
 value of {1} (which is generally considered as a non-optimal
 setting).

 {State}: Only table spaces in state {ONLINE} and {READONLY}
 will be found by inventory and monitored. If the state changes
 later, the check will {not} get critical. The state will
 just be displayed. We assume that state changes are due
 to normal operations.

 {Size}: The logic of the size check depends on whether
 autoextend is on or off. If auto extension is on, then
 the still possible extensions are accounted for as free
 spaces as well as the space currently free in the
 data files. If auto extension is off, only the currently
 free space will be honored. Table spaces in state {READONLY}
 will {not} be checked for the size.

 {temptablespace}: Ignore temporary Tablespace by default. This
 can be changed when this parameter is True.

 This check needs the Checkmk {mk_oracle}-plugin installed in
 the agent. Please refer to the online documentation
 for how to install that plugin.

item:
 The SID and the tablespace name, separated by a dot, for example {"pengt.TEMP"}.

inventory:
 One service is created for each tablespace which is {ONLINE}, {READONLY} or {OFFLINE}.

cluster:
 In case a cluster is configured, the node with the most data files will be checked.
