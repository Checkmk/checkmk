 This check checks the current state of a Open vSwitch bonding interface.
 If the total bonding state of the interface is down, then the
 check gets critical. If at least one slave interface is down
 or not the expected slave is currently active, then the check
 gets WARN.

item:
 The name of the bonding interface, etc {bond0}.

inventory:
 One service is created for each {active} bonding interface.
 During inventory the current active interface is considered
 to be the primary interface.
 This is only relevant if you configure a detection of
 a change in the active interface.
