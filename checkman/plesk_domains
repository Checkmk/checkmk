title: Dumps out the domains configured in Plesk
agents: linux
catalog: app/Plesk
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 Plesk is a commercial webhosting management software. It allows you to
 manage multiple independent webspace instances including domains and
 so on.

 This check simply outputs all domains configured in a local plesk
 installation. It raises a {WARNING} state when no domain is configured,
 otherwise the plugin is always reporting an {OK} state.

 To make this check work you need to install the agent plugin
 {plesk_domains} on the host wich runs Plesk in the
 directory {/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins}.

inventory:
 One check per system is created if the {plesk_domains} agent plugin
 is installed and working (it outputs the {<<<plesk_domains>>>} section).
