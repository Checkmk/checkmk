title: Plesk: Configured Domains
agents: linux
catalog: app/plesk

distribution: check_mk
description:
 Plesk is a commercial webhosting management software. It allows you to
 manage multiple independent webspace instances including domains and
 so on.

 This check simply outputs all domains configured in a local plesk
 installation. It raises a {WARNING} state when no domain is configured,
 otherwise the plugin is always reporting an {OK} state.

 To make this check work you need to install the agent plugin
 {plesk_domains} on the host wich runs Plesk in the
 directory {/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins}.

inventory:
 One service is created for each system.
