title: PostgreSQL: Bloat
agents: linux
catalog: app/postgresql
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check allows tracking of how bloated the tables and indexes of a database are.
 It requires that the ANALYZE function is running regularly and that stats collection
 is turned on.

 You can configure limits for the total amount of wasted bytes or the percentual
 bloat size. The limits can be configured for the table bloat as well as the
 index bloat.

 This check relies on data reported by the agent-side plugin {mk_postgres}

item:
 Name of the category and the name of the database

inventory:
 One service is created for each database.
