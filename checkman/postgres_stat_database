title: PostgreSQL: Statistics
agents: linux
catalog: app/postgresql
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check handles the metrics returned from PostgreSQL's statistics
 functions {pg_stat_database} and {pg_database_size}.
 It allows monitoring of {disk blocks read}, but PostgreSQL seems to not
 have a simple "written bytes" or "write IOs" counter, meaning this
 information cannot be directly monitored.

 Instead, the check allows more fine-grained monitoring of database activity
 by tracking what the queries really do.
 You can monitor both "read statements" like {fetches}, as well as
 "write statements as {update/delete/insert}. Finally it allows monitoring of
 {commits}, which PostgreSQL tracks down to the sub-transaction level.

 You can then define levels on the per-second amount of the statements.

 This check relies on data reported by the agent-side plugin {mk_postgres}

item:
 Name of the category and the name of the database

discovery:
 One service is created for each database.
