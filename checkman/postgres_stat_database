title: Database statistics for PostgreSQL
agents: linux
catalog: app/postgresql

distribution: check_mk
description:
  This check handles the metrics returned from PostgreSQL's statistics
  functions {pg_stat_database} and {pg_database_size}.
  It allows monitoring of {disk blocks read}, but PostgreSQL seems to not
  have a simple "written bytes" or "write IOs" counter, meaning this
  information cannot be directly monitored.

  Instead, the check allows more fine-grained monitoring of database activity
  by tracking what the queries really do.
  You can monitor both "read statements" like {fetches}, as well as
  "write statements as {update/delete/insert}. Finally it allows monitoring of
  {commits}, which PostgreSQL tracks down to the sub-transaction level.

  You can then define levels on the per-second amount of the statements.

  This check relies on data reported by the agent-side plugin {mk_postgres}

inventory:
  One item is generated per database.

perfdata:
  The numbers for disk blocks read, and the number of transactions per
  transaction type.
