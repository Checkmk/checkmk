title: PostgreSQL: Last Vacuum and Analyze for Tables
agents: linux
catalog: app/postgresql
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check allows you to monitor the last VACUUM and ANALYZE time for tables in
 a PostgreSQL database. You can configure limits specifiying the maximum age of the last operation.
 Without additional limits configuration this check is always OK.

 This check relies on data reported by the agent-side plugin {mk_postgres}.

 Check status:

 For every table the time since it has last been analyzed or vacuumed is checked
 according to the WATO rule "PostgresSQL VACUUM and ANALYZE: Time since the last
 VACUUM" and "Time since the last ANALYZE" respectively. For tables that were
 never analyzed or vacuumed the time period for which they exist is checked
 according to the WATO rule "PostgresSQL VACUUM and ANALYZE: Age of never
 analyzed/vacuumed tables".

item:
 One of the two statements {{VACUUM}} or {{ANALYSE}} plus the name of the database

inventory:
 Two services are created for each database.
 One service for {{VACUUM}} and one for {{ANALYZE}}.
