 # This is the default (hard coded) definition of the
 # state code handling.
 # -> All state codes listed after "2:" result in a CRITICAL state
 # -> All state codes listed after "1:" result in a WARNING state
 # -> All state codes listed after "0:" result in a OK state

[configuration]
printer_alerts_state_map(dict): Can be used to configure state codes
 reported by the printer to result in individual nagios states. This
 dictionary contains three elements. One for each nagios state. Each
 element holds a list of state codes to result in this state.
 Take a look at the example section to see the defaults.

printer_alerts_text_map(dict): Some printers send a status code of {-1} in some cases.
 But you can use the additional descriptive text sent by the printer for assigning
 a monitoring state by using this dictionary. The key is the descriptive text. The
 value is 0 (OK), 1 (WARN), 2 (CRIT) or 3 (UNKNOWN).
