title: Generic Printer: Output Unit State
agents: snmp

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the state of output units withing printers. It monitors
 the state provided and also outputs the filling state information provided
 by the printer.

 The printer has to support the generic PRINTER-MIB.

 By default the check outputs {CRITICAL} when either the printer reports 100%
 units filled or reports a critical error state. A {WARNING} state is
 raised when a non-critical error is provided.

 According the PRINTER-MIB it's possible that a printer couldn't determine
 how much is remaining in a supply, so the printer says "at least one remaining".

item:
 Name of the printer (if set) otherwise the description, type or index of the printer

inventory:
 One service is created for each unit with a unique name.
