distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the remaining filling level in percent of a printers
 supplys like toner or fuser. The printer has to support the generic
 PRINTER-MIB.
 The default check levels are 20% (warning) and 10% of the full level
 (critical).
 According the PRINTER-MIB it's possible that a printer couldn't determine
 how much is remaining in a supply, so the printer says "some remaining".
 This value produces a warning.

 In case of OKI c5900 devices the name of the supply units ins not unique.
 One example is {Toner Cartridge OKI DATA CORP}. In this case the color of
 the supply unit is added to the beginning of the name to get a unique
 item name.

perfdata:
 The remaining filling level in units (pages remaining).

inventory:
 One check is being created for each supply unit with a unique name.
