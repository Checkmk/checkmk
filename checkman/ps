title: State and Count of Processes
agents: linux, windows, aix, solaris, openvms

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check looks into the list of then current running processes for
 those matching a certain name or regular expression and optionally
 being owned by a certain user. The number of
 matching processes is matched against warning and critical levels.

item:
 A user definable service description for Nagios.
 That description must be unique within each host.
 Changing the description will make Nagios think that
 it is another service.

inventory:
 One service is created for each configured process on the monitored system.
 Since Checkmk cannot know which processes are of relevance to you,
 some configuration is needed. The configuration is done via the ruleset
 {inventory_processes_rules}.

 During inventory Checkmk tries to match all entries on each
 process found on the target host.
 If an entry matches, one new service will be created according
 to the entry (if it's not already existing).
