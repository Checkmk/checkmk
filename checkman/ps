title: State and Count of Processes
agents: linux, windows, aix, solaris, openvms
catalog: os/ps
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check looks into the list of then current running processes for
 those matching a certain name or regular expression and optionally
 being owned by a certain user. The number of
 matching processes is matched against warning and critical levels.

item:
 A user definable service description for Nagios.
 That description must be unique within each host.
 Changing the description will make Nagios think that
 it is another service.

inventory:
 As of version 1.1.1, {ps} supports inventory. Since Check_MK cannot
 know which processes are of relevance to you, some configuration is
 needed. The configuration is done via {inventory_processes}. The structure
 of that variable is a list of seven-tuples. It is similar but not
 completely the same as the configuration of manual checks. The seven
 components of each entry are: {(1)} a service description, {(2)} a pattern
 (just as the first parameter of the check), {(3)} a
 user specification and {(4)} - {(7)} the warning and critical levels
 for the number of processes.

 During inventory Check_MK tries to match all entries on each
 process found on the target host. If an entry matches, a new check will
 be created according to the entry (if it's not already existing).

 The {service description} may contain one or more occurances of {%s}.
 If you do this, then the pattern must be a regular expression and
 be prefixed with {~}. For each {%s} in the description, the expression has to contain
 one "group". A group is a subexpression enclosed in brackets, for example
 {(.*)} or {([a-zA-Z]+)} or {(...)}. When the inventory finds a process
 matching the pattern, it will substitute all such groups with the
 {actual values} when creating the check. That way one rule can create
 several checks on a host.

 If the pattern contains more groups then occurrances of {%s} in
 the service description then only the first matching subexpressions
 are used for the service descriptions. The matched substrings corresponding
 to the remaining groups are copied into the regular expression, nevertheless.

 New in version 1.2.2: As an alternative to {%s} you may also use {%1}, {%2},
 etc. These will be replaced by the first, second, ... matching group. This
 allows you to reorder things.

 Wildcards not enclosed by brackets are simply copied verbatim to the created
 checks. Please refer to the examples for more details.

 The {user specification} can either be a user name (string). The inventory
 will then trigger only if that user matches the user the process is running as
 and the resulting check will require that user.  Alternatively you can specify
 {ANY_USER} or {GRAB_USER}.  If you specify {ANY_USER} then the user field
 will simply be ignored.  The created check will not check for a specific user.

 Specifying {GRAB_USER} makes the created check expect the process to run
 as the same user as during inventory: the user name will be hardcoded into
 the check. In that case if you put {%u} into the service description,
 that will be replaced by the actual user name during inventory. You need
 that if your rule might match for more than one user - your would create
 duplicate services with the same description otherwise.

 The {warning and critical levels} are simply copied to the created
 checks.

 As of version {1.1.7i1} ps inventory allows optional host specification.
 You can prepend a list of host names or a list of tag names and {ALL_HOSTS}
 to some of all rules of the inventory specification. That way you can
 make the inventory apply some rules only to certain hosts.

[configuration]
inventory_processes (list): A list of 7-tuples. See {INVENTORY} for details.

[parameters]
procname (string): Process specification. This can either be the name of a process as ouput by the agent.
   It must exactly match the first column of the agents output. Or - if the string is
   beginning with a tilde - it is interpreted as a regular expression that must match
   the beginning of the process line as output by the agent. For the Linux/UNIX agents
   this allows you to match specific command line arguments of the process. A third possibility is to
   set the process name to {None}. In that case {all} processes will match. This is probably only useful
   if you specify a user name.
user (string): Name of user that owns the process(es). This parameter is optional and can be left out completely.
warnmin (int): Minimum number of matched process for WARNING state
okmin (int): Minimum number for OK state
okmax (int): Maximum number for OK state
warnmax (int): Maximum number for WARNING state. Counts less than warnmin or greater than
 warnmax are CRITICAL

parameters (dict): Or the parameters can be given in the new, dictionary based syntax
   with the elements below.
   In this case additional parameters cpulevels and cpu_average can be passed.

{"process"}: procname, see above
{"user"}: see above
{"warnmin"}: see above
{"warnmax"}: see above
{"okmin"}: see above
{"okmax"}: see above
{"cpulevels"}: (float, float): levels of CPU usage for {WARN} and {CRIT} in percent
{"cpu_average"}: int: build average over CPU usage for the given time in minutes
