title: State and Count of Processes (with additional Performance Data)
agents: linux
catalog: os/ps
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check does exactly the same as {ps}, but in addition
 outputs performance data. Please refer to the manpage of {ps} for more details.

 Note: If you want to use {ps.perf} on Windows systems then you need to install
 the plugin {psperf.bat} into the {plugins} directory of you Windows agent.
 Do not use {wmicchecks.bat}. This is obsolete.

item:
 Name of the process

inventory:
 One service is created for each configured process on the monitored system.
 Since Checkmk cannot know which processes are of relevance to you,
 some configuration is needed. The configuration is done via the ruleset
 {inventory_processes_perf}.
