description:
 This check uses the data provided by the {mk_sap} agent plugin, which uses
 RFC calls to retrieve monitoring information from SAP R/3 systems. To make
 this check work, you have to deploy the {mk_sap} agent plugin on a host.

 This check looks into the list of nodes which the agent is sending data
 for. You can adapt the agent plugin configuration to modify this list.
 The check simply uses the states, performance values and outputs generated
 by SAP, there are no special thresholds or similar to configure here.

item:
 A combination of the SAP system ID and, space separated, the path of the
 node to process the information of.

discovery:
 By default no services are created. You can use the inventory option
 {inventory_sap_values}. This is a hostlist which contains dictionaries
 as parameters.

 At the moment, the only parameter is the {match} paramter. It is used
 during inventory to filter the list of all available nodes by their paths
 and add the matching ones to the list of inventorized services.

 During inventory Checkmk tries to match all entries on each
 node found on the target host.
 If an entry matches one service is created according to the entry
 (if it's not already existing).
