 The check simply outputs the current text of string values reported by Siemens PLC (SPS) devices.

 You need to use and configure the special agent {agent_siemens_plc} which is using the SNAP7
 library to communicate with the Siemens PLC. When you are using OMD, everything is already
 installed and configured. In manual setups, you will need to ensure that the snap7 library
 and python module {snap7} are installed.
 To make temperature values available for the check, you need to configure the memory addresses
 and data types to read from the device as temperature values.

 The checks does always returns {OK}.

 One check for each configured text value is created automatically.
