description:
 Monitors the current CPU state of Siemens PLC (SPS) devices.

 You need to use and configure the special agent {agent_siemens_plc} which is using the SNAP7
 library to communicate with the Siemens PLC. When you are using OMD, everything is already
 installed and configured. In manual setups, you will need to ensure that the snap7 library
 and python module {snap7} are installed.

 The CPU state can either be reported as running ({OK}), stopped ({CRITICAL}) and unknown
 ({UNKNOWN}).

inventory:
 One service is created for each device.
