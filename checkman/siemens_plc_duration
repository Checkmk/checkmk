description:
 The check monitors the duration values reported by Siemens PLC (SPS) devices. Currently the
 check can only deal with hour based values.

 You need to use and configure the special agent {agent_siemens_plc} which is using the SNAP7
 library to communicate with the Siemens PLC. When you are using OMD, everything is already
 installed and configured. In manual setups, you will need to ensure that the snap7 library
 and python module {snap7} are installed.
 To make temperature values available for the check, you need to configure the memory addresses
 and data types to read from the device as temperature values.

 The checks does not {WARN}/{CRIT} unless you configure the thresholds for the check, as the
 device does not report any thresholds. When the duration value is smaller than the previous
 one, the check goes to {CRIT} for one check.
