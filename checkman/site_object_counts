title: Checkmk: Site Objects
agents: linux
catalog: app/cmk

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check collects information about the amount of different
 host types or used check commands of Checkmk sites.

 To make this check work please install the {{mk_site_object_counts}}
 agent plugin and specify host tags or check commands within the
 {{site_object_counts.cfg}} configration file. The following options
 are available:

 - {TAGS}: global host tags

 - {SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS}: global check commands

 - {SITES}: restriction to specified sites

 - {TAGS_$SITENAME}: site specific host tags

 - {SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS_$SITENAME}: site specific check commands


 The agent plugin is executed if and only if OMD is installed and there's
 a configuration file. Sites which provide an opened Livestatus socket
 {/omd/sites/$SITENAME/tmp/run/live} are taken into account.

 Without the restrictive option {SITES} all sites on that server are
 considered which satisfy above conditions.

 If more than one value is assigned they have to be separated by one space, eg.

 - {TAGS=prod snmp}

 - {SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS_sitename=kernel lnx_if}


 {Example 1}

 {TAGS=snmp}

 {SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS=interfaces}

 With this configuration the agent plugin returns the amount of all SNMP hosts
 and the amount of all interface services of the type {interfaces} of all sites.


 {Example 2}

 {SITES=site_a site_b}

 {TAGS=snmp}

 {SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS=interfaces}

 With this configuration the agent plugin returns the amount of all SNMP hosts
 and the amount of all interface services of the type {interfaces} of the sites
 {site_a} and {site_b}.


 {Example 3}

 {TAGS_site_a=snmp}

 {SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS_site_a=interfaces}

 {TAGS_site_b=agent}

 {SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS_site_b=lnx_if}

 With this configuration the agent plugin returns

 - the amount of all SNMP hosts and the amount of all interface services
 of the type {interfaces} of the site {site_a} and

 - the amount of all agent-based hosts and the amount of all Linux interface
 services of the type {lnx_if} of the site {site_b}.


 {Example 4}

 {TAGS=prod}

 {SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS=omd_apache omd_status}

 {TAGS_site_a=snmp}

 {SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS_site_a=interfaces}

 {TAGS_site_b=agent}

 {SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS_site_b=lnx_if}

 With this configuration the agent plugin returns

 - the amount of all productive hosts and services of type {omd_apache} and
 {omd_status} of all sites.

 - additionally, the amount of all SNMP hosts and the amount of all interface
 services of the type {interfaces} of the site {site_a} and

 - additionally, the amount of all agent-based hosts and the amount of all
 Linux interface services of the type {lnx_if} of the site {site_b}.


 {Example 5}

 {SITES=site_a site_b site_c}

 {TAGS=prod}

 {SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS=omd_apache omd_status}

 {TAGS_site_a=snmp}

 {SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS_site_a=interfaces}

 {TAGS_site_b=agent}

 {SERVICE_CHECK_COMMANDS_site_b=lnx_if}

 With this configuration the agent plugin returns

 - the amount of all productive hosts and services of type {omd_apache} and
 {omd_status} of the sites {site_a}, {site_b} and {site_c}.

 - additionally, the amount of all SNMP hosts and the amount of all interface
 services of the type {interfaces} of the site {site_a} and

 - additionally, the amount of all agent-based hosts and the amount of all
 Linux interface services of the type {lnx_if} of the site {site_b}.

 The check is always in the state OK.

inventory:
 One service is created.

cluster:
 In the clustered case, the check reports the counted tags and service check commands
 for each site on each node separately. Moreover, the summarized output reports the numbers
 of tags and service check commands summed over all sites and nodes.
