description:
 This check monitors health statistics like error counters of HDDs using the
 information reported by S.M.A.R.T. This check works only for HDDs which
 report the value {Temperature_Celsius} via {smartctl -A <device>}.

 The check uses information provided by the Checkmk linux agent which are
 available when the agent has been extended with the {smart} agent plugin.

 During inventory the current value of all counters is being
 snapshotted into the check's parameters. If later one of the value increases
 the check gets critical. It will become green again if the check is
 being reinventorized.

item:
 Name of the disk

inventory:
 One service is created if there is at least one supported value
 available for a HDD.
