description:
 This check queries the global status of local PBX supporting the
 SNI-OCTOPUS-E Mib.
 Most common example is the Siemens HiPath 3000 and 5000 series.
 The device uses this status to reflect the worst state of all parts that do
 report such a status. (It is not documented which those are)
 It knows 5 different states ranging from "normal" to "critical", which are
 mapped into corresponding Nagios states.

inventory:
 One service named "Global Status" is created.
