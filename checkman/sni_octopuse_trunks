description:
 This check queries the status of trunk ports on local PBX
 supporting the SNI-OCTOPUS-E Mib.
 Most common example is the Siemens HiPath 3000 and 5000 series.
 Using this check you should be able to be notified if your telco line has
 failed.
 Such a port can be either "active" or "inactive".
 If a port switches to "inactive" the check will mark this port as {CRIT}

item:
 The index of the card and the index of the port seperated by a {{/}}

discovery:
 One service is created for each trunk port if two conditions are fulfilled.

 - The port must be named "S0 trunk: extern"

 - The port must be in an active state at the time of inventory.

 The check can easily be extended to handle other port types.
