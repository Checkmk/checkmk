description:
 This check queries the status of trunk ports on local PBX
 supporting the SNI-OCTOPUS-E Mib.
 Most common example is the Siemens HiPath 3000 and 5000 series.
 Using this check you should be able to be notified if your telco line has
 failed.
 Such a port can be either "active" or "inactive".
 If a port switches to "inactive" the check will mark this port as {CRIT}

inventory:
 The check will inventorize a trunk port if two conditions are fulfilled.
 The port must be named "S0 trunk: extern" and be in an active state at the
 time of inventory. The check can easily be extended to handle other port
 types.
 A service named "Trunk port" including a slot/port ID is generated for
 each port and used as the check item.
