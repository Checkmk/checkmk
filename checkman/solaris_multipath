description:

 This check monitors the state of multipathed SCSI devices on Solaris 10
 systems using the {"mpathadm"} utility.  It alerts if missing paths are
 reported by the OS.

 Missing paths are determined by comparing the total number of paths with
 the current number of paths.  The total number of paths is taken from the
 time the last inventory was made.

 The check will return a {"WARNING"} if at least 50% of the paths to
 a LUN are working.  The alert will return {"CRITICAL"} if less than 50%
 of the paths to a LUN are working.

 The check will also return a {"WARNING"} if the number of total paths was
 not yet inventorized, or if the number of total paths has increased since
 last inventory.

item:
 The WWID (Word Wide Identifier) of the logical unit number.

inventory:
 One service is created for each LUN that is reported by mpathadm. The total
 number of paths for each created service is also remembered during inventory.
