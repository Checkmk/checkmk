description:
 This check looks for the return value of the prtdiag command on solaris based systems.
 A return value of 0 is interpreted as OK as documented in the prtdiag man page.
 Each other return value results in a CRITICAL state.

 CAVEAT:
 The extend of the hardware that is considered in the prtdiag command varies from
 solaris platform to platform (i.e. huge differences between e.g. M series and T
 series systems). Please have a look at the documentation of prtdiag for your system.
