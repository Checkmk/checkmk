title: SSH Daemon Configuration: Parameters
agents: linux
catalog: app/sshd
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors security-relevant parameters of the effective SSH
 daemon configuration (sshd -T). Note that this explicity excludes
 context-specific configurations defined via Match directives. Hence,
 as an example, even if this service reports that password authentication
 is off, this does not garantuee that no user can ssh into the system using
 a password.

 Expected values for the relevant parameters can be configured
 using the associated WATO rule.

 For this check the agent plugin mk_sshd_config needs to be
 installed.

inventory:
 One service is created.
