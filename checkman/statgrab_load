title: CPU Load (by statgrab)
agents: hpux, solaris
catalog: os/kernel
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check measures and checks the averaged CPU load during the last check
 cycle by using the statgrab tool of the operating system. The values
 for 1, 5 and 15 minute average are sent, although the PNP template
 shipped with check_mk only displays the 1 and 15 min average load.

 Make sure you have the statgrab binary available on the monitored
 machine. Under HP-UX you also need to activate the hpux_statgrab agent plugin.

 Note: The CPU load is the average number of processes that are
 currently in the state "running". Do not mix this up with the
 CPU "utiliziation" (which measures the current usage of the CPU
 in percent).

discovery:
 One service is created for each host
 if the agent output contains a {statgrab_load} section.
