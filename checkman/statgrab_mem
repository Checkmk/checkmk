title: Usage of Physical and Virtual RAM
agents: hpux, solaris
catalog: os/kernel
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check measures the current usage of physical RAM and
 virtual memory used by processes. You can define a warning
 and critical level for the usage of virtual memory,
 {not} for the usage of RAM.

 Check_mk lets you define levels in percentage of
 the physically installed RAM or as absolute
 values in MB. The default levels
 are at 150% and 200%. That means that this check
 gets critical if the memory used by processes
 is twice the size of your RAM.

 See check manpage for {mem.used} too.

 Make sure you have the statgrab binary available on the monitored
 machine. Under HP-UX you also need to activate the hpux_statgrab agent plugin.

discovery:
 One service is created on every machine with statgrab.
