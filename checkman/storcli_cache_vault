description:
 This check monitors the status of cache vault units on controllers that are based on LSI Megaraid chipsets, if they support cache vautls.
 The Linux agent will try find any existing controllers - if {storcli} or {storcli64} is in your PATH.

 {storcli} can be downloaded from LSI at the following URL
 {https://docs.broadcom.com/docs/007.2007.0000.0000_Unified_StorCLI.zip}

 The service goes to {CRIT} if the state is not "Optimal".
 It will go to {WARN} if the controller reports "Replacement required".

item:
  {{/c}} followed by the ID (number) of the controller.

discovery:
  One service is created for each controller that has a cache vault.
