description:
  This check tests the overall health status reported by snmp-enabled
  devices from supermicro. Currently this has only been tested with
  data from a mainboard on windows. In this case an agent has to be
  enabled through the SuperDoctor III software.

  Status {OK}, {WARN} and {CRIT} are taken directly from the device.

inventory:
  Exactly one item is generated on supported devices.
