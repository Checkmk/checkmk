description:
 This check tests individual sensors (Fan speeds, voltages,
 temperatures) reported by snmp-enabled devices from supermicro.
 Currently this has only been tested with data from a mainboard on
 windows. In this case an agent has to be enabled through the
 SuperDoctor III software.

 Status {OK}, {WARN} and {CRIT} are determined based on upper and
 lower levels reported by the device. On top of that, the device
 itself reports a status which is applied if it's worse than the
 calculated one.

item:
 Name of the sensor

discovery:
 One service is created for each sensor.
