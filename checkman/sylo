title: State of the sylo daemon
agents: linux
catalog: os/services
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 Sylo ensures that syslog messages are first stored on the disk before sending
 them over the network to a remote syslog server using TCP. This can prevent
 loss of syslog messages due to local system failures.

 This check uses the output of the check_mk agent when the sylo agent
 plugin provided in the agents/plugins directory is installed on the host which
 runs the sylo daemon. The check analyzes the last update time of the hint file,
 the fill state of the silo and the throughput - means the amount of processed
 logs as rates.

inventory:
 Each host which provides the section in the check_mk agent gets one Sylo service.
