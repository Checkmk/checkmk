title: Synchronization of Operating System Time
agents: windows, vsphere
catalog: os/misc

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check is a simple check of the correct setting of the current
 system time of the target host. It simply compares the local time
 on the monitoring server with that measured by the agent on the
 target host. It is not very accurate since it does not account for
 the systematic time delay between the output of the time by the agent
 and the actual processing of that data by Checkmk.

 Its advantage however, is that it works on any Windows or ESX host
 - regardless of the method used to synchronize the time.

 Levels can be set for making the check warn/crit if the time difference
 exceeds the configured limits.

discovery:
 One service is created for each host supporting this check.
