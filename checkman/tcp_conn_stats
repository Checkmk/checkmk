title: Number of TCP connections per state
agents: linux
catalog: os/networking
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the number of TCP connections in the various possible states,
 which are: {ESTABLISHED}, {SYN_SENT}, {SYN_RECV}, {LAST_ACK}, {CLOSE_WAIT}, {TIME_WAIT}, {CLOSED}, {CLOSING}, {FIN_WAIT1}, {FIN_WAIT2}.

inventory:
 If there is at least one TCP connection, then one check will be created.
 On agents supporting {tcp_conn_stats} this should always be the case since at
 least the connection to the agent should be shown.

examples:
 # set levels for TIME_WAIT and ESTABLISHED
 tcp_conn_stats_default_levels = { "TIME_WAIT" : (20, 50), "ESTABLISHED" : (100, 200) }
