title: Number of TCP Connections per State
agents: linux
catalog: os/networking
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the number of TCP connections in the various possible states,
 which are: {ESTABLISHED}, {SYN_SENT}, {SYN_RECV}, {LAST_ACK}, {CLOSE_WAIT}, {TIME_WAIT}, {CLOSED}, {CLOSING}, {FIN_WAIT1}, {FIN_WAIT2}.

inventory:
 One service is created if there is at least one TCP connection.
 On agents supporting {tcp_conn_stats} this should always be the case since at
 least the connection to the agent should be shown.
