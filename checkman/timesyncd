description:
 This check uses the output of {timedatectl timesync-status} as sent by the
 agent. It lists the information of the synchronised time server including
 the server address, stratum, offset and jitter. The check gets critical
 if the time offset exceeds a default level, if the stratum is too high or
 other error conditions. It gets UNKNOWN if the time has not yet been
 synchronised. The check logic is shared with the ntp check. On a running
 instance the time is synchronised either using ntp or timesyncd. The agent
 therefore determines the correct service to use and subsequent check.

 Note: this check is only available for versions higher than Ubuntu 18.04

discovery:
 One service is created if the {timedatectl timesync-status} command
 is available.
