description:
 This check is used on servers running Tivoli storage manager to
 monitor staging pools.
 It can alert you if you are running low on remaining space in the
 pool.

 The check goes to warning or critical if the number of media
 that are considered as "free" falls under a threshold.

 This is done by setting a user defineable value for the used
 percentage on a tape up to which you think it still makes sense
 to append to it, and then defining alert levels on the
 number of of tapes that need to have more than the limit.

 The check also tells you about the average utilization of all the
 tapes that still have enough capacity reserve to be considered
 as free.

item:
 The name of the staging pool.


inventory:
 The check creates one item per staging pool found.

perfdata:
  The number of tapes that are considered free,
  the average utilization  and the levels for alerting

[parameters]
tsm_stagingpools_default_levels (dict):
   {"free_below"}: A percentage (float) for the usage below which a tape is considered
                    to be free.

   {"levels"}     A pair of integers of levels for warning and critical for the number
                  of required free tapes
