 This check monitors the RAM and swap via SNMP on systems running the
 UCD SNMP daemon. This daemon is mostly found on Linux systems and used
 by some hardware appliances (such as Riverbed Steelhead or Dell EMC ECS).

 Upper default levels for the RAM are set to 80, 90%. There are no default
 levels the swap usage. These values are configurable using the WATO rule
 "Main memory usage of simple devices". Note that the check counts buffered
 and cached memory as free memory, as one should for Linux systems.
