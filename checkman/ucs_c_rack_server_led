description:
 This check monitors the LEDs of UCS C-Series Rack Servers. By default, the state of
 the service depends on the color of the LED as follows:

 - {OK} for blue and green

 - {WARN} for amber

 - {CRIT} for red

 - {UNKN} for all other colors

 This behavior can be changed using the rule "State of Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Server
 LEDs". Besides the color, the service also reports the name of the LED and its operational
 state.
