description:
 This check provides information about the overall utilization of an UCS C-Series Rack Servers
 racks. The monitored value is a composite metric (CPU, memory and PCI IO utilization) of a servers
 rack units in percent. Internal to the server the metric is measured as CUPS Index (Compute Units
 per Second) and is a composition of the CPU RMCs (Resource Monitoring Counters), memory RMCs and
 the PCI IO RMCs. For more info about a description about these mertics refer to the check manuals
 of this checks sub checks {checkman/ucs_c_rack_server_util.cpu,
 checkman/ucs_c_rack_server_util.io, checkman/ucs_c_rack_server_util.mem}.

 This check supports the following C-Series Rack Server models providing XML API 2.0
 [Cisco UCS Rack-Mount Servers Cisco IMC XML API 2.0]:

 - Cisco UCS C220 M5 Rack Server

 - Cisco UCS C240 M5 Rack Server

 - Cisco UCS C480 M5 Rack Server

 - Cisco UCS C480 ML M5 Rack Server

 - Cisco UCS C220 M4 Rack Server

 - Cisco UCS C240 M4 Rack Server

 - Cisco UCS C460 M4 Rack Server

 This check does not support the C-Series Rack Server model "Cisco UCS C125 M5 Rack Server Node"
 which is used as part of a "Cisco UCS C4200 Series Rack Server Chassis".

 Check status:

 - {OK} in case the monitored overall utilization is within the configured valid range.

 - {WARN} in case the monitored overall utilization is equal or higher than the configured warn level.

 - {CRIT} in case the monitored overall utilization is equel or higher than the configured crit level.

 The default value for the {warn} level is 90.0%. The default value for the {crit} level is 95.0%.
 The {warn} and {crit} level are configurable via WATO rule {Device Component Overall Utilization}.

inventory:
 One service is created for each server rack included in the agent plugin output.

item:
 {{Rack unit}} followed by the index of the rack
