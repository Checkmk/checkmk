description:
 This check provides information about the CPU utilization of an UCS C-Series Rack Servers racks.
 The metric is based on the aggregation of all RMCs (Resource Monitoring Counters) of a servers
 rack unit and describe the cumulative utilization of all CPU cores.

 This check supports the following C-Series Rack Server models providing XML API 2.0
 [Cisco UCS Rack-Mount Servers Cisco IMC XML API 2.0]:

 - Cisco UCS C220 M5 Rack Server

 - Cisco UCS C240 M5 Rack Server

 - Cisco UCS C480 M5 Rack Server

 - Cisco UCS C480 ML M5 Rack Server

 - Cisco UCS C220 M4 Rack Server

 - Cisco UCS C240 M4 Rack Server

 - Cisco UCS C460 M4 Rack Server

 This check does not support the C-Series Rack Server model "Cisco UCS C125 M5 Rack Server Node"
 which is used as part of a "Cisco UCS C4200 Series Rack Server Chassis".

 Check status:

 - {OK} in case the monitored CPU utilization is within the configured valid range.

 - {WARN} in case the monitored CPU utilization is equal or higher than the configured warn level.

 - {CRIT} in case the monitored CPU utilization is equel or higher than the configured crit level.

 The default value for the {warn} level is 90.0%. The default value for the {crit} level is 95.0%.
 The {warn} and {crit} level are configurable via WATO rule {CPU utilization of Devices with Modules}.

discovery:
 One service is created for each server rack included in the agent plugin output.
