description:
 This checks monitors a UPS that supports the generic UPS-MIB,
 such as General Electric (GE) SitePro UPS, and also tries
 some vendor-specific MIBs.
 The check monitors
 the time the UPS is on battery (in seconds),
 the battery capacity (in percent),
 and the remaining runtime (in seconds).
 Warning and critical levels can be given for the remaining
 run time and for the battery capacity. The time-remaining-metric,
 as well as the levels for both metrics, will only be
 shown/applied if the device is on battery.

inventory:
 One service is created for each UPS.
