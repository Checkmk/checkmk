description:
 This check monitors parameters related to the self test of UPS devices: the result of the
 last self test and the last date of the self test run. The check becomes {CRIT} if the test
 result is {"doneError"} or {"aborted"}, and {WARN} if the result is {"doneWarning"} or
 {"noTestsInitiated"}. It also has a {WARN} or {CRIT} state if the date of the last self
 test is more than the warning or critical level ago.

examples:
 # sets the warning and critical levels to 5 and 10 days, respectively
 ups_test_default = ( 5, 10 )

inventory:
 The inventory process checks if the device has a system description OIDs
 (.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0) and if the name of this OID is known to the test. If
 this is true the system is inventorized.
