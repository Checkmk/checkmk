description:

 This check monitors parameters related to the self test of UPS devices: the
 result of the last self test and the last date of the self test run. The
 check becomes {CRIT} if the test result is {"doneError"} or {"aborted"},
 and {WARN} if the result is {"doneWarning"} or {"noTestsInitiated"}. It also
 has a {WARN} or {CRIT} state if the date of the last self test is more than
 the warning or critical level ago.

inventory:
 The inventory process checks if the device has a system description OIDs
 (.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0) and if the name of this OID is known to the test. If
 this is true the system is inventorized.
