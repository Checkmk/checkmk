description:
 This check monitors the status of backups of clients carried out by the Veeam
 backup tool. In order to carry out the checks, the Veeam agent plugin
 needs to be installed on the backup server. See special instructions in the
 comment section of the two Veeam agent plugin scripts on how to install
 the scripts.

 The plugin sends data for all virtual machines as piggyback data in the agent
 output of the backup server.

 This check is {OK} if the status of the backup is {success}, {Pending}
 or {InProgress}. It is {WARN} if the status is {Warning}. It is {CRIT}
 if the status of the backup is {Failed}.

 In addition {WARN} and {CRIT} levels can be set for the time since the end
 of the last backup.
