description:
 This check monitors the status of backups of clients carried out by the Veeam
 backup tool. In order to carry out the checks, the Veeam agent plugin
 needs to be installed on the backup server. See special instructions in the
 comment section of the two Veeam agent plugin scripts on how to install
 the scripts.

 The plugin sends data for all virtual machines as piggyback data in the agent 
 output of the backup server.

 This check is {OK} if the status of the backup is {success}, {Pending}
 or {InProgress}. It is {WARN} if the status is {Warning}. It is {CRIT}
 if the status of the backup is {Failed}.

inventory:
 A check will be created for all hosts known to check_mk and reported
 by the Veeam agent plugin.

perfdata:
 Total Size, duration and the average speed of the backup will be recorded 
 as performance data. Duration will not be recorded if the status of the backup
 is {Pending} or {InProgress}.
