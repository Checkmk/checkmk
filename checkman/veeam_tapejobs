description:
 This check monitors the status of the tape jobs run by the Veeam
 backup tool. In order to carry out the check, the Veeam agent plugin
 needs to be installed on the backup server. See special instructions in the
 comment section of the Veeam agent plugin powershell scripts on how to install
 the scripts.

 This check is {OK} if the last tape job ran successfully and {CRIT} otherwise,
 provided the backup is not currently in progress.

 While the tapejob is running, the status is determined by the levels set on
 maximum acceptable time the job is supposed to take.

inventory:
 One service is created for each tape job created by the Veeam tool.

item:
 The name of the tape job.
