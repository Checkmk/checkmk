title: Veritas Cluster Service: Resource
agents: linux
catalog: os/services
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check needs the {check_mk_agent.linux} agent which provides information
 about the Veritas Cluster Service if it is installed.

 The check determines the state of the Veritas Cluster based on the following
 priorities:

 OK: All nodes are online or running
 CRIT: At least one node is faulted
 UNKNOWN: At least one node is unknown
 OK: At least one node is online or running, others may be offline
 WARN: All nodes are offline

 Additionally, the check also reports frozen or temporarily frozen states (WARN
 and CRIT respectively). In this case, the overall state of the service becomes
 the worst of the two states.

 The above are default levels, but the check may be configured using the
 "Veritas Cluster Server" ruleset.

item:
 The cluster name.

discovery:
 One service is created for each resource.

cluster:
 On a cluster, the service determines the overall cluster state based on the
 same priorities.
