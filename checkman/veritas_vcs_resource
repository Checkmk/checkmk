description:
 This check needs the {check_mk_agent.linux} agent which provides
 information about the Veritas Cluster Service if it is installed.

 The check monitors the resource state and can have the following states:

 - "ONLINE" will be OK,

 - "OFFLINE" will be WARN,

 - "FAULTED" will be "CRIT",

 - "OFFLINE|STATE UNKNOWN" or "ONLINE|STATE UNKNOWNEXITED" will be UNKNOWN,

 - all others will be WARN.

 The check is cluster-aware. In this case:

 - if all service groups report the same, that state is used,

 - if any service group reports "FAULTED", "UNKNOWN", "ONLINE" or
   "RUNNING", the respective state will be used (checked in that order)

 - otherwise the states will be concatenated.

item:
 The resource name.

inventory:
 One service is created for each resource.

cluster:
  On a cluster the service assumes the worst of all encountered node states.
