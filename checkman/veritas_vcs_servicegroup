description:
 This check needs the {check_mk_agent.linux} agent which provides
 information about the Veritas Cluster Service if it is installed.

 The check monitors the service group states. A states map can be
 configured in the rule "Veritas Cluster Server". By default the
 check can have the following states:

 - "ONLINE" will be OK,

 - "OFFLINE" will be WARN,

 - "FAULTED" will be CRIT,

 - all others will be WARN

 The check is cluster-aware. In this case

 - if all service groups report the same, that state is used,

 - if any service group reports "FAULTED", "UNKNOWN", "ONLINE" or
   "RUNNING", the respective state will be used (checked in that order)

 - otherwise the states will be concatenated.

 Additionaly the service group is checked for being (temporarily) frozen.
 By default

 - temporarily frozen will be WARN

 - frozen will be CRIT

item:

inventory:
