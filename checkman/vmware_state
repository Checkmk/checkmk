description:
 This check uses the command {vcbVmName -s any} to monitor
 the state of the virtual machines. It assumes that a machine
 is up and running, if it has an IP address. Maybe this assumption
 is wrong. I'm not an expert for VMWare, so if you know it
 better, please tell me.

item:
 The name of the virtual machine as output by {vcbVmName -s any}
 (after the line {name:})

inventory:
 The inventory creates checks for all machines that are currently
 up (i.e. have an ip address)
