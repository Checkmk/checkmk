description:
 This check monitors different temperature sensors on Vutlan EMS devices which
 support the vutlan.mib.

 The check returns a WARN or CRIT status if the temperature exceeds or falls
 below the configurable levels. It is also possible to perform trend
 computations. The upper limits are 35°C and 40°C for WARN/CRIT states, and
 the lower limits are 0°C and -1°C for WARN/CRIT states by default.

 The corresponding ruleset for configuring these levels is the
 "Temperature" ruleset.

item:
