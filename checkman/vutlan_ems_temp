description:
 This check monitors different temperature sensors on Vutlan EMS devices which
 support the vutlan.mib.

 The check returns a WARN or CRIT status if the temperature exceeds or falls
 below the configurable levels. It is also possible to perform trend
 computations. The upper limits are 35째C and 40째C for WARN/CRIT states, and
 the lower limits are 0째C and -1째C for WARN/CRIT states by default.

 The corresponding ruleset for configuring these levels is the
 "Temperature" ruleset.
