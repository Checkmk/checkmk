description:
  This check verifies status of disk enclosures or arrays
  connected to a host running Veritas VxVM.

  It is in status {OK} an enclosure is in status CONNECTED.
  Any other status will be reported as a {CRIT} status, assuming
  the enclosure has lost connectivity or has been removed.
  Veritas also lists the local disks of a system in a
  "pseudo-enclosure" named {OTHER_DISKS}. If you do not run
  the local disks under Veritas control, you can add these to
  {ignored_services}.

inventory:
  One item is generated per VxVM disk enclosure, the naming is
  inherited from VxVM. See the man page for {vxdmpadm} about
  naming enclosures.
