description:
  This check verifies status of multipath devices managed using
  Veritas native multipathing {VxDMP} on a host running Veritas VxVM.
  It will return {OK} if all configured paths are active.
  Otherwise, it will decide based on the number of active paths.
  If more than 50% of the paths are still active, it will return a
  {WARN} status, or a {CRIT} if less than 50% - or none - paths are
  still working.


inventory:
  One item is generated per multipathed LUN. It is named after the
  volume managers' {access name} for the disk.
