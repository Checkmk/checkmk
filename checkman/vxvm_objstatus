description:
  This check is used to track the status of objects in Veritas VxVM.
  Currently, it can only track the status of {v} - Volume level objects.
  It will be {OK} if a volume is an active status, or if it was
  dismounted/stopped cleanly by admin action. If any other status is
  detected, it will go to {CRIT}.

  If a diskgroup goes to {disabled} by catastrophic failure or admin
  error, the check can no longer report the volume status, as the
  volumes as objects become unavailable.

  The check should be extensible for tracking status in multiple layers.


inventory:
  One item is generated per volume in the volume manager.
  The naming is {diskgroup}-{volume}.
  The inventory includes layered volumes {v2}, if you do not need data on
  these, use {ignored_services} to exclude them from monitoring.
