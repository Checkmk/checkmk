description:
  This check evaluates the output of the {netstat -an} command on windows
  and checks if there are established connections or listeners
  matching a given criteria.

  The check returns {OK} state if the specified connection/listener is present,
  and {CRIT} if not.

  This check needs the agent plugin {netstat_an.bat} to be installed.

item:
  This is a manual Checkplugin. One service is created for every rule set up
  using the WATO ruleset "Monitor specific TCP/UDP connections and listeners".
