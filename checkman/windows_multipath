description:
 This check monitors number of active multipaths on a Windows host.
 If this number equals the number recorded at inventory time,
 the check will return {OK}, or otherwise {WARN} if there are still
 more than 50% of paths left operative.
 Anything less than 50% of working paths will turn into a {CRIT} state.

discovery:
 One service is created if there's a number of paths returned from the
 API. In our tests this was only if the system had actual storage assigned.
