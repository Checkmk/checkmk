description:
 Checks the current state of a Windows bonding interface
 (configured on operating system level).
 If the total bonding state of the interface is down, then the
 check returns {CRIT}, for status degraded it returns {WARN}.
 If at least one slave interface is down or not the expected slave
 is currently active, then the check gets {WARN}.

 For this check to work you need to install the agent plugin
 windows_os_bonding.ps1 on the target machine.

 Since the check uses the same check logic as lnx_bonding, please
 refer to lnx_bonding check manpage vor examples and parameters.

inventory:
 One check will be created for every bonding interface found in state
 up or degraded.
