title: Windows: Updates
agents: windows
catalog: os/misc

distribution: check_mk
description:
 The check uses WMI to fetch the number of pending important and optional updates
 on a windows system. It also checks if a reboot is needed after installing updates.

 By default the check only fetches the information and never raises WARNING/CRITICAL
 states. But this can be configured.

 The windows agent needs to be extended with the {windows_updates.vbs} provided
 in {agents/windows/plugins}.

inventory:
 One service named {System Updates} is created for each host.
