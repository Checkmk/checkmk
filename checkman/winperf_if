title: State and performance of network interfaces of Windows hosts
agents: windows
catalog: os/networking
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the operational status, link speed, traffic, packet
 counts, discards and errors of network interfaces of a Windows host using
 data sent by the Check_MK agent.

 In order to get information about the link status and MAC address you
 need to deploy the agent plugin {wmic_if.bat} into the {plugins} directory
 of your Check_MK agent for Windows. On servers with just one network
 interface you probably won't need the information about the link status,
 since the agent will be unreachable anyway if the status is not {up}.
 We propose to not installing the plugin in that case and save a few
 CPU ressources.

 The interface index (in SNMP known as {ifIndex}) is simulated by
 creating an artificial running index after sorting the names of
 the interfaces alphabetically.

 All other aspects of this check are completely compatible of {if}.
 Please refer to that man page for further information.
