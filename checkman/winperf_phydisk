title: Disk throughput on Windows
agents: windows
catalog: os/storage

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check measures the throughput of physical disk on Windows
 hosts by using the performance counter object {234}. The Check_MK
 agent for Windows sends this object in the section {<<<winperf_phydisk>>>}
 starting from version {1.1.11i1}. If you have defined the {counters}
 in {check_mk.ini}, please make sure, that the entry {234:phydisk}
 is present.

 Please add {"winperf.diskstat"} to you {ignored_checktypes} in {main.mk},
 if all of your agents support {winperf_phydisk}.

 This check share the same code and features as the check {diskstat},
 so the rest of this manual page is identical with that of diskstat.

 You can either have a single check for every single disk
 (which is the default) or a summary check summing up the throughput
 of all disks.

 You can apply separate warning and critical levels for the read
 and write throughput. Optionally you can have the check compute
 average values on a configurable time period and have the levels
 applied on the average instead of the current values. This makes
 it possible to ignore short "peaks" and only trigger and longer
 phases of high disk activity.

 The check also gives info on the IOPS.

item:
 Either {"SUMMARY"} for a summarized check of alls disks or the
 name of the disk device, e.g. {"C:"}.

inventory:
  The inventory is configured via {diskstat_inventory_mode}. If this is set
  to {"single"} (the default), then one check will be created for each
  disk. If it is set to {"summary"} then only one service per host will be
  created that has at least one hard disk. If set to {"legacy"} then a
  separate check for read and write will be created (deprecated).
