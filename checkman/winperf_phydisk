description:
 This check measures the throughput of physical disk on Windows
 hosts by using the performance counter object {234}. The Checkmk
 agent for Windows sends this object in the section {<<<winperf_phydisk>>>}
 starting from version {1.1.11i1}. If you have defined the {counters}
 in {check_mk.ini}, please make sure, that the entry {234:phydisk}
 is present.

 Please add {"winperf.diskstat"} to you {ignored_checktypes} in {main.mk},
 if all of your agents support {winperf_phydisk}.

 This check share the same code and features as the check {diskstat},
 so the rest of this manual page is identical with that of diskstat.

 You can either have a single check for every single disk
 (which is the default) or a summary check summing up the throughput
 of all disks.

 You can apply separate warning and critical levels for the read
 and write throughput. Optionally you can have the check compute
 average values on a configurable time period and have the levels
 applied on the average instead of the current values. This makes
 it possible to ignore short "peaks" and only trigger and longer
 phases of high disk activity.

 The check also gives info on the IOPS.

item:
 Either {"SUMMARY"} for a summarized check of alls disks or the
 name of the disk device, e.g. {"C:"}.

discovery:
 One service is created for each disk if the configuration is set to {"single"}.
 If the configuration is set to {"summary"} one service is created for each host.
 If set to {"legacy"} then two services one for read and one for write
 is created (deprecated).

 The inventory is configured via {diskstat_inventory_mode}.

cluster:
  On a cluster the check is run on the aggregated data.
  WATCH OUT: Disk names that are present on more than one node potentialy
  shadow each others results.
