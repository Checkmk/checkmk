description:
 This check monitors the process queue length and produces 1, 5 and
 15 minute averages.
 This works roughly the same as CPU load known from the unix world.
 The only difference is that while unix-based system include processes
 currently being run in the CPU load, windows counts only the number
 of processes that are waiting to be processed.
 This means that unless the system is under high load, this will be 0.
 {WARN} and {CRIT} thresholds can be configured, which will be treated
 as per-core averages so if the warn level is at 2 on a 4 core system,
 the 15 minute average processor queue length has to be 8 processes or
 longer.

inventory:
 One service is created.
