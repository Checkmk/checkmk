description:
 Note: This check is obsolete. Do not install {wmicchecks.bat} anymore. Use
 {psperf.bat} in combination with the normal {ps.perf} check. The rest of
 this man page is unchanged for legacy reasons:

 This check uses the output of {wmic process} in order to monitor the resource
 consumption of processes on Windows servers. On the target host this check
 needs the command line utility {wmic} and the agent plugin {wmicchecks.bat}
 (in the subdirectory {plugins} below the directory where {check_mk_agent.exe}
 is located).

 The monitored parameters are CPU usage ({KernelModeTime} + {UserModeTime}),
 RAM usage ({WorkingSetSize}) and page file usage ({PageFileUsage}).
 If more than one process matches the name, then all matching processes resources
 are added.

 If no matching process is found running, then the check is always OK (since
 no resources are consumed).
