description:
 This check monitors the length of the mail queues of Zertificon mail encryption appliances.
 The following seven queues are monitored:

 - Total Postfix queue

 - Incoming queue

 - Active queue

 - Deferred queue

 - Hold queue

 - Maildrop queue

 - Z1 Messenger queue

 The check goes WARN / CRIT if the length of any of these queues exceeds configurable
 levels. Per default, there are no upper levels.

discovery:
 This check is only available as an enforced service, configurable via
 "Setup > Enforced services > Zertificon Mail Queues".
 This is necessary because Zertificon appliances cannot be decisively identified based
 on their SNMP data.
