description:
 Checks the current size and usage of ZFS storage pools. The information
 is read by the agent from {zpool list}. This check can be configured
 using the filesystem rule.

 In a simple setup where a pool is mapped 1:1 to a mountpoint and where no
 snapshots are used, this will report the same information as the zfsget
 check.

item:
 The mountpoint of the filesystem

inventory:
 One service is created for each pool.
