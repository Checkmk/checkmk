description:
 Checks the current state of a ZFS storage pool. The information
 is read by the agent from {/usr/sbin/zpool status -x}. If the zpool
 is healthy you're OK. If an inventoried zpool has been destroyed or
 has an error the check goes CRITICAL.
 If the extend state information from zpool status indicates any CRC or
 other errors, the check will go to WARNING.

inventory:
 The inventory will create one service per host if there are any pools.
