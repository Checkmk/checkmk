description:
 Checks the current state of a ZFS storage pool. The information
 is read by the agent from {/usr/sbin/zpool status -x}. If the zpool
 is healthy you're OK. If an inventoried zpool has been destroyed or
 has an error the check goes CRITICAL.

inventory:
 The inventory will create one service per host if there are any pools.
