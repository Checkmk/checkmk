# Possible values for state:
#  Valid values are:
#
#  normal(1):         the environment is good, such as low
#                     temperature.
#
#  warning(2):        the environment is bad, such as temperature
#                     above normal operation range but not too
#                     high.
#
#  critical(3):       the environment is very bad, such as
#                     temperature much higher than normal
#                     operation limit.
#
#  shutdown(4):       the environment is the worst, the system
#                     should be shutdown immediately.
#
#  notPresent(5):     the environmental monitor is not present,
#                     such as temperature sensors do not exist.
#
#  notFunctioning(6): the environmental monitor does not
#                     function properly, such as a temperature
#                     sensor generates a abnormal data like
#                     1000 C.
