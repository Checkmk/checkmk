# normal(1):         the environment is good, such as low
#                    temperature.
# warning(2):        the environment is bad, such as temperature
#                    above normal operation range but not too
#                    high.
# critical(3):       the environment is very bad, such as
#                    temperature much higher than normal
#                    operation limit.
# shutdown(4):       the environment is the worst, the system
#                    should be shutdown immediately.
# notPresent(5):     the environmental monitor is not present,
#                    such as temperature sensors do not exist.
# notFunctioning(6): the environmental monitor does not
#                    function properly, such as a temperature
#                    sensor generates a abnormal data like
#                    1000 C.
