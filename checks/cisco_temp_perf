#                normal(1):         the environment is good, such as low
#                                   temperature.
#
#                warning(2):        the environment is bad, such as temperature
#                                   above normal operation range but not too
#                                   high.
#
#                critical(3):       the environment is very bad, such as
#                                   temperature much higher than normal
#                                   operation limit.

#                shutdown(4):       the environment is the worst, the system
#                                   should be shutdown immediately.
#
#                notPresent(5):     the environmental monitor is not present,
#                                   such as temperature sensors do not exist.
#
#                notFunctioning(6): the environmental monitor does not
#                                   function properly, such as a temperature
#                                   sensor generates a abnormal data like
#                                   1000 C.
