# Description of the /proc/drbd output:
# http://www.drbd.org/users-guide/ch-admin.html#s-proc-drbd
#
# The information from /proc/drbd are grouped as followed (Extracted from doc above)
#
# General:
#   cs (connection state). Status of the network connection. See the section called
#               “Connection states” for details about the various connection states.
#    Available States:
#      StandAlone. No network configuration available. The resource has not yet been connected,
#                  or has been administratively disconnected (using drbdadm disconnect),
#                  or has dropped its connection due to failed authentication or split brain.
#      Disconnecting.  Temporary state during disconnection. The next state is StandAlone.
#      Unconnected.  Temporary state, prior to a connection attempt.
#                    Possible next states: WFConnection and WFReportParams.
#      Timeout. Temporary state following a timeout in the communication with the peer. Next state: Unconnected.
#      BrokenPipe. Temporary state after the connection to the peer was lost. Next state: Unconnected.
#      NetworkFailure. Temporary state after the connection to the partner was lost. Next state: Unconnected.
#      ProtocolError. Temporary state after the connection to the partner was lost. Next state: Unconnected.
#      TearDown. Temporary state. The peer is closing the connection. Next state: Unconnected.
#      WFConnection. This node is waiting until the peer node becomes visible on the network.
#      WFReportParams. TCP connection has been established, this node waits for the first network packet from the peer.
#      Connected. A DRBD connection has been established, data mirroring is now active. This is the normal state.
#      StartingSyncS. Full synchronization, initiated by the administrator, is just starting.
#                     The next possible states are: SyncSource or PausedSyncS.
#      StartingSyncT. Full synchronization, initiated by the administrator, is just starting. Next state: WFSyncUUID.
#      WFBitMapS. Partial synchronization is just starting. Next possible states: SyncSource or PausedSyncS.
#      WFBitMapT. Partial synchronization is just starting. Next possible state: WFSyncUUID.
#      WFSyncUUID. Synchronization is about to begin. Next possible states: SyncTarget or PausedSyncT.
#      SyncSource. Synchronization is currently running, with the local node being the source of synchronization.
#      SyncTarget. Synchronization is currently running, with the local node being the target of synchronization.
#      PausedSyncS. The local node is the source of an ongoing synchronization, but synchronization is currently paused.
#                   This may be due to a dependency on the completion of another synchronization process,
#                   or due to synchronization having been manually interrupted by drbdadm pause-sync.
#      PausedSyncT. The local node is the target of an ongoing synchronization, but synchronization
#                   is currently paused. This may be due to a dependency on the completion of another
#                   synchronization process, or due to synchronization having been manually interrupted by drbdadm pause-sync.
#      VerifyS. On-line device verification is currently running, with the local node being the source of verification.
#      VerifyT. On-line device verification is currently running, with the local node being the target of verification.
#
#   ro (roles). Roles of the nodes. The role of the local node is displayed first, followed by the role of the partner
#               node shown after the slash. See the section called “Resource roles” for details about the possible resource roles.
#    Available Roles:
#      Primary. The resource is currently in the primary role, and may be read from and written to.
#               This role only occurs on one of the two nodes, unless dual-primary node is enabled.
#      Secondary. The resource is currently in the secondary role. It normally receives updates
#                 from its peer (unless running in disconnected mode), but may neither be read from
#                 nor written to. This role may occur on one node or both nodes.
#      Unknown. The resource's role is currently unknown. The local resource role never has this status.
#               It is only displayed for the peer's resource role, and only in disconnected mode.
#
#   ds (disk states). State of the hard disks. Prior to the slash the state of the local node is displayed,
#                     after the slash the state of the hard disk of the partner node is shown.
#                     See the section called “Disk states” for details about the various disk states.
#    Disk States:
#      Diskless. No local block device has been assigned to the DRBD driver. This may mean that the resource
#                has never attached to its backing device, that it has been manually detached using drbdadm detach
#                or that it automatically detached after a lower-level I/O error.
#      Attaching. Transient state while reading meta data.
#      Failed. Transient state following an I/O failure report by the local block device. Next state: Diskless.
#      Negotiating. Transient state when an Attach is carried out on an already-connected DRBD device.
#      Inconsistent. The data is inconsistent. This status occurs immediately upon creation of a new resource,
#                    on both nodes (before the initial full sync). Also, this status is found in one node
#                    (the synchronization target) during synchronization.
#      Outdated. Resource data is consistent, but outdated.
#      DUnknown. This state is used for the peer disk if no network connection is available.
#      Consistent. Consistent data of a node without connection. When the connection
#                  is established, it is decided whether the data are UpToDate or Outdated.
#      UpToDate. Consistent, up-to-date state of the data. This is the normal state.
#
# Network:
#   ns (network send).  Volume of net data sent to the partner via the network connection; in Kibyte.
#   nr (network receive).  Volume of net data received by the partner via the network connection; in Kibyte.
# Disk:
#   dw (disk write). Net data written on local hard disk; in Kibyte.
#   dr (disk read). Net data read from local hard disk; in Kibyte.
# Stats:
#   al (activity log). Number of updates of the activity log area of the meta data.
#   bm (bit map).  Number of updates of the bitmap area of the meta data.
#   lo (local count). Number of open requests to the local I/O sub-system issued by DRBD.
#   pe (pending). Number of requests sent to the partner, but that have not yet been answered by the latter.
#   ua (unacknowledged). Number of requests received by the partner via the network connection, but that have not yet been answered.
#   ap (application pending). Number of block I/O requests forwarded to DRBD, but not yet answered by DRBD.
#   ep (epochs). Number of epoch objects. Usually 1. Might increase under I/O load
#                when using either the barrier or the none write ordering method. Since 8.2.7.
#   wo (write order). Currently used write ordering method: b (barrier), f (flush), d (drain) or n (none). Since 8.2.7.
#   oos (out of sync). Amount of storage currently out of sync; in Kibibytes. Since 8.2.6.
