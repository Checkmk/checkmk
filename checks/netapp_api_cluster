# Cluster states according to docu:

# takeover_started - Takeover process has begun
# takeover - Currently controlling partner's resources.
# taken_over - Partner is controlling filer's resources
# takeover_failed - Failed to takeover the partner
# giving_back - Sendhome process in progress
# giveback_partial_waiting - This node controls partner aggregates even
#                            though the node is not in takeover. And we're waiting for a connection to the partner.
# giveback_partial_connected - This node controls partner aggregates even though the node is not in takeover.
#                              The partner is available to receive the aggregates.
# waiting_for_root_aggr - Partner is controlling dblade's root aggregate If we're in this state, many other optional fields are not returned.
# waiting - Waiting for a connection to partner. Generally happens while partner is rebooting.
# in_maintenance_mode - node is in maintenance mode. In the mode it is not possible to determine more detailed information (e.g. cluster or not; takeover or not, etc).
# pending_shutdown - starting a takeover/sendhome is inhibited due to a pending system shutdown. i
# error - There is an error with the system
# User have to compare the return values case-insensitively.
