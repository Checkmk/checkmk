# First generation of agents output only the process command line:
# /usr/sbin/xinetd -pidfile /var/run/xinetd.pid -stayalive -inetd_compat -inetd_ipv6

# Second generation of agents output the user in brackets in the first columns:
# (root) /usr/sbin/xinetd -pidfile /var/run/xinetd.pid -stayalive -inetd_compat -inetd_ipv6

# Third generation (from 1.1.5) output also virtual memory, resident memory and %CPU:
# (class,122376,88128,0.0) /usr/jre1.6.0_13/bin/java -Dn=Cart_16TH13 -Dmcs.node=zbgh1ca -Dmcs.mdt.redundan

# Forth generation (>=1.2.5), additional columns in bracket:
# (user, virtual_size, resident_size, %cpu, processID, pagefile_usage, usermodetime, kernelmodetime, openHandles, threadCount) name
# (\\KLAPPRECHNER\ab,29284,2948,0,3124,904,400576,901296,35,1)    NOTEPAD.EXE

# Sixth generation (>=1.2.7) adds an optional etime, joined by "/" with the CPU time

# The plugin "psperf.bat" is deprecated. As of version 1.2.5 all of this information
# is reported by the windows agent itself. However, we still support sections from psperf.bat
# if the agent version is lower than 1.2.5.
# Windows agent now ships a plugin "psperf.bat" that adds a section from wmic
# to the output:
