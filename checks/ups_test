# Description of OIDs used from RFC 1628
# OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.33.1.7.3
# upsTestResultsSummary OBJECT-TYPE
# SYNTAX INTEGER {
#     donePass(1),
#     doneWarning(2),
#     doneError(3),
#     aborted(4),
#     inProgress(5),
#     noTestsInitiated(6)
# }
# MAX-ACCESS read-only
# STATUS current
# DESCRIPTION
# "The results of the current or last UPS diagnostics
# test performed. The values for donePass(1),
# doneWarning(2), and doneError(3) indicate that the
# test completed either successfully, with a warning, or
# with an error, respectively. The value aborted(4) is
# returned for tests which are aborted by setting the
# value of upsTestId to upsTestAbortTestInProgress.
# Tests which have not yet concluded are indicated by
# inProgress(5). The value noTestsInitiated(6)
# indicates that no previous test results are available,
# such as is the case when no tests have been run since
# the last reinitialization of the network management
# subsystem and the system has no provision for non-
# volatile storage of test results."

# OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.33.1.7.4
# upsTestResultsDetail OBJECT-TYPE
# SYNTAX DisplayString (SIZE (0..255))
# MAX-ACCESS read-only
# STATUS current
# DESCRIPTION
# "Additional information about upsTestResultsSummary.
# If no additional information available, a zero length
# string is returned."

# OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.33.1.7.5
# Description:
# upsTestStartTime OBJECT-TYPE
# SYNTAX TimeStamp
# MAX-ACCESS read-only
# STATUS current
# DESCRIPTION
# "The value of sysUpTime at the time the test in
# progress was initiated, or, if no test is in progress,
# the time the previous test was initiated. If the
# value of upsTestResultsSummary is noTestsInitiated(6),
# upsTestStartTime has the value 0."
