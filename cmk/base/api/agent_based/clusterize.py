    """Aggregate the results of a node check

    The results of the check on the node are aggregated.
    The state is the worst of all individual states (as checkmk would
    compute it for the service on the node).

    If no results for the nodes are available, an OK state and None is returned.

    Example:
        To yield the summary results of every node of a cluster from within a
        cluster_check_function use

            for node_name, node_section in sections.values():
                node_state, node_text = aggregate_node_details(
                    node_name,
                    check_my_plugin(item, node_section),
                )
                if node_text is not None:
                    yield Result(state=node_state, notice=node_text)

        Note that this example will send text to the services summary only if the
        state is not OK, otherwise to the details page.

    Args:
        node_name: The name of the node
        node_check_returns: The return values or generator of the nodes check_function call

    Returns:
        Aggregated node result. None if the node check returned nothing.
