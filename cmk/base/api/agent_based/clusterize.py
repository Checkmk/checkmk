    """Aggregate the results of a node check into a single Result

    The results of the check on the node are aggregated into a single
    Result instance, showing all node results in its details.
    The state is the worst of all individual states (as checkmk would
    compute it for the service on the node).

    If no results for the nodes are available, None is returned.

    Example:
        To yield the summary results of every node of a cluster from within a
        cluster_check_function use

            for node_name, node_section in sections.values():
                summary_result = aggregate_node_details(
                    node_name,
                    check_my_plugin(item, node_section),
                )
                if summary_result is not None:
                    yield summary_result

        Note that this will send no text to the services summary, only to the
        details page.

    Args:
        node_name (str): The name of the node
        node_check_returns (Sequence[Union[IgnoreResults, Result, Metric]]): The return values or
        generator of the nodes check_function call

    Returns:
        Optional[Result]: Aggregated node result. None if the node check returned nothing.
