"""
These functions allow checks to keep a memory until the next time
the check is being executed. The most frequent use case is compu-
tation of rates from two succeeding counter values. This is done
via the helper function get_rate(). Averaging is another example
and done by get_average().

While a host is being checked this memory is kept in _cached_item_states.
That is a dictionary. The keys are unique to one check type and
item. The value is free form.

Note: The item state is kept in tmpfs and not reboot-persistant.
Do not store long-time things here. Also do not store complex
structures like log files or stuff.
