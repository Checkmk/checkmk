# This function must be executed for each agent line which has been
# found for the current item. It must deal with the ORA-* error
# messages. It has to skip over the lines which show the SQL statement
# and the SQL error message which comes before the ORA-* message.
#
# The check must completely skip the lines before the ORA-* messages
# and return UNKNOWN on the first found ORA-* message.
# line[0] is the item (db instance)
#
# This function returns a tuple when an ORA-* message has been found.
# It returns False if this line should be skipped by the check.
