#   We are adding this nevertheless (for now!), because some very popular MKPs are      #
#   relying on it, and we want our users to experience a smoother upgrade.              #
#   However, these kind of courtesies are not sustainable.                              #

#   If you are using these functions, please include a copy of them in your MKP.        #
#   That way your MKP will not break inadvertedly.                                      #
