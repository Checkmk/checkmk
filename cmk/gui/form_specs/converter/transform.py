    It was introduced to transform ugly formatted data from disk to a format that is more
    suitable for the FormSpecs. It should only be used for
     - legacy reasons if the old data format cannot be cleaned up within a reasonable time
       The correct way to transform legacy data is to use a migration function in the FormSpec.
     - recompose functions where a formspec is shown as a composition of other form specs


    This form spec is used to transform a value from one format to another.
    It does -not- add any extra logic, layout or title
    The value is only transformed on DataOrigin.DISK
