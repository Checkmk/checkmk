    Notes:
        If `include_all_services` is set to True, the services table is only queried
        once, instead of len(host_name) times. If a lot of hosts are to be scheduled, this
        will save N queries. Issuing the command is still done sequentially.

    Args:
        connection:
            A livestatus connection object.

        host_entry:
            The host-name for which this downtime is for.

        start_time:
            When the downtime shall begin.

        end_time:
            When the downtime shall end.

        include_all_services:
            If set, downtimes for all services associated with the given host will be scheduled.
            Defaults to False.

        recur:
            The recurring mode of the new downtime. Available modes are:
                * fixed
                * hour
                * day
                * week
                * second_week
                * fourth_week
                * weekday_start
                * weekday_end
                * day_of_month

            This only works when using the Enterprise Editions. Defaults to 'fixed'.

        trigger_id:
            The id of another downtime-entry. If given (other than 0) then this downtime will be
            triggered by the other downtime.

        duration:
            Duration in minutes. When set, the downtime does not begin automatically at a nominated
            time, but when a real problem status appears for the host. Consequencely, the
            start_time/end_time is only the time window in which the scheduled downtime can begin.

        user_id:

        comment:
            A comment which will be added to the downtime.
