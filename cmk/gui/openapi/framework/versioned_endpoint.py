    Versioning follows a bottom-up inheritance model. When a handler is not explicitly defined

    most recent previously defined version. This creates a chain of fallbacks where each
    version potentially builds upon its predecessors.

    Versioning build example:
        APIVersion.V1 (specified) -> APIVersion.V2 (not specified) -> APIVersion.V3 (specified)

        APIVersion.V2 will implicitly inherit the handler of the V1

    Legacy marshmallow endpoint:
        If an equivalent marshmallow endpoint exists then the marshmallow endpoint will represent the first
        released version (not necessarily APIVersion.V1) of the endpoint.

    Notes:
        * only the individual handlers are version specific
        * all other attributes such as metadata should not change across versions (e.g.
        changing the path of an endpoint would be rather a new endpoint instead). However, if
