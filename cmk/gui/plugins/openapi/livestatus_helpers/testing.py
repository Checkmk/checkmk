class MockLiveStatusConnection:
    """Mock a LiveStatus connection.

    NOTE:
        You probably want to use the fixture: cmk.gui.conftest:mock_livestatus

    This object can remember queries and the order in which they should arrive. Once the expected
    query was accepted, the pre-stored response will be given back.

    It is up to the test-writer to set the appropriate queries and their responses.

    The class will verify that:
     * The expected queries (and _only_ those) are being issued in the `with` block.
       This means that:
         * Any additional query will trigger a RuntimeError
         * Any missing query will trigger a RuntimeError
         * Any mismatched query will trigger a RuntimeError
         * Any wrong order of queries will trigger a RuntimeError

    Args:
        report_multiple (bool):
            When set to True, this will potentially trigger mutliple Exceptions on __exit__. This
            can be useful when debugging chains of queries. Default is False.

    Examples:

        This will pass:

            >>> live = (MockLiveStatusConnection()
            ...         .expect_query("GET hosts")
            ...         .expect_query("GET services"))
            >>> with live(expect_status_query=False):
            ...     live.query_non_parallel("GET hosts", '')
            ...     live.query_non_parallel("GET services", '')

        This will pass as well (useful in real WATO or REST-API calls):

            >>> live = MockLiveStatusConnection()
            >>> with live:
            ...     response = live.query_non_parallel(
            ...         ('GET status\\n'
            ...          'Cache: reload\\n'
            ...          'Columns: livestatus_version program_version program_start '
            ...          'num_hosts num_services'),
            ...         ''
            ...     )
            ...     # Response looks like [['2020-07-03', 'Check_MK 2020-07-03', 1593762478, 1, 36]]
            ...     assert len(response) == 1
            ...     assert len(response[0]) == 5

        This example will fail due to missing queries:

            >>> live = MockLiveStatusConnection()
            >>> with live():  # works either when called or not called
            ...      pass
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            RuntimeError: Expected queries were not queried:
             * 'GET status\\nCache: reload\\nColumns: livestatus_version program_version \
program_start num_hosts num_services'

        This example will fail due to a wrong query being issued:

            >>> live = MockLiveStatusConnection().expect_query("Hello\\nworld!")
            >>> with live(expect_status_query=False):
            ...     live.query_non_parallel("Foo\\nbar!", '')
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...

             * 'Hello\\nworld!'
            Got query:
             * 'Foo\\nbar!'

        This example will fail due to a superfluous query being issued:

            >>> live = MockLiveStatusConnection()
            >>> with live(expect_status_query=False):
            ...     live.query_non_parallel("Spanish inquisition!", '')
            Traceback (most recent call last):
