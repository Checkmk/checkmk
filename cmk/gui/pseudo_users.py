    """Alternative type for UserIds

    We have cases where we want something to authenticate to the UI/RestAPI that is not a real user.
    Previously we mostly used automation users for that.
    This is error prone since we rely on certain permissions which admins could change. Besides that
    we needed to store the cleartext passwords in order to use them. These were then synced across
    all remote sites (if sync was enabled...).

    Unfortunately our current auth function does not return User objects but UserIds which is
    basically the username. For these Pseudo users we don't want to have usernames that would then
    need to be reserved... Therefore we now return this class.
