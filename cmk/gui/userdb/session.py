"""Create and manage user sessions.

When single user sessions are activated, a user an only login once a time. In case a user tries to
login a second time, an error is shown to the later login.

To make this feature possible a session ID is computed during login, saved in the users cookie and
stored in the user profile together with the current time as "last activity" timestamp. This
timestamp is updated during each user activity in the GUI.

Once a user logs out or the "last activity" is older than the configured session timeout, the
session is invalidated. The user can then login again from the same client or another one.
