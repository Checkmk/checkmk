description:
 This check monitors the AWS/CloudWatch alarms limits, ie. the
 number of allowed alarms withing a region.

 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}.

 You can configure upper levels for {WARN}/{CRIT} in percent (default: 80, 90).
 and the maximum value (default: 5000).

 If limits are enabled all alarms are fetched regardless of
 possibly configured restriction to names.

discovery:
 One service is created per monitored AWS region.
