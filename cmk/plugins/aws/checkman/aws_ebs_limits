description:
 This check monitors the AWS/EBS limits.

 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}.

 We get the following default limits:

 - Total Block store snapshots: 100000

 - Total Magnetic volumes space: 300 TiB

 - Total Provisioned IOPS SSD space: 300 TiB

 - Total Provisioned IOPS SSD IO operations per second: 300000

 - Total General Purpose SSD space: 300 TiB

 - Total Cold HDD space: 300 TiB

 - Total Throughput Optimized HDD space: 300 TiB

 The current value for each limit type is calculated by summing
 up the related values from API method {{describe_volumes}}.

 With both values we calculate the usage of each limit type
 in percent.

 The default {WARN}/{CRIT} levels are set to 80, 90 percent per type.

 For each limit type the limit and usage levels are configurable.

 The service goes {WARN}/{CRIT} if one or more of these levels are exceeded.

 If limits are enabled all volumes are fetched regardless of
 possibly configured restriction to names or tags.

discovery:
 One service is created per monitored AWS region.
