 This check monitors the AWS/Glacier limits, i.e. the number of
 allowed vaults withing a region.

 Default levels are set to 80, 90 percent and the default max.
 value of 1000.

 These levels are configurable.

 If limits are enabled all vaults are fetched regardless of
 possibly configured restriction to names or tags.

 One service is created per monitored AWS region.
