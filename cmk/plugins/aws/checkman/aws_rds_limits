description:
 This check monitors the AWS/RDS limits.

 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}.

 From the AWS API method {{describe_account_attributes}}
 we get the following default limits:

 - DB instances: 40

 - Reserved DB instances: 40,

 - Allocated storage: 100 TB

 - DB security groups: 25

 - Authorizations per DB security group: 20

 - DB parameter groups: 50

 - Manual snapshots: 100

 - Event subscriptions: 20

 - DB subnet groups: 50
 - Option groups: 20

 - Subnet per DB subnet groups: 20

 - Read replica per master: 5

 - DB clusters: 40

 - DB cluster parameter groups: 50

 - DB cluster roles: 5

 From above API method we additionally get the amount of used
 instances/space per limit type.

 With both values we calculate the usage of each limit type
 in percent.

 Default levels are set to 80, 90 percent for each type.
 For each limit type, the limit and usage levels are configurable
 via the rule "AWS/RDS Limits".

 If limits are enabled account attributes of RDS resource are
 additionally fetched.

discovery:
 One service is created per monitored AWS region.
