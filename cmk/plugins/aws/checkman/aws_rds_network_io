 No default levels are set, but levels are configurable via the
 rule "Network interfaces and switch ports".

item:
 Name of the instance and region name (to avoid duplicate services
 in case of multi-region monitoring).

discovery:
 One service is created for each database if all required metrics
 (NetworkReceiveThroughput, NetworkTransmitThroughput) are given.
