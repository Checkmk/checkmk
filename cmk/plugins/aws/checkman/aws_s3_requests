title: AWS S3: Requests
agents: aws
catalog: cloud/aws
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the total number of requests and the
 number of get, put, delete, head post, select and list
 requests made for objects in an AWS S3 bucket. Values are
 reported in counts per second and as a fraction of the
 total number of requests.

 To make this check work, you have to configure the related
 special agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}. Furthermore, you
 have to enable request metrics in the AWS/S3 console. This is
 a paid feature. Note that the filter name has to be set to
 `EntireBucket`, as is recommended in the AWS documentation for
 a filter that applies to all objects. The AWS special agent
 uses this filter name to query S3 request metrics from the AWS
 API.

 No default levels are set. Upper levels on the fractions are
 configurable.

item:
 Name of the bucket

discovery:
 One service is created for each bucket if all required metrics
 (AllRequests) are given.
