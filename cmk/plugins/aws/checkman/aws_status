 This check reports the issues from the AWS Health RSS page
 https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status/.

 To make this check work you have to configure the related special
 agent via {Amazon Web Service (AWS) Status}. The regions, which are
 discovered, can be configured.

 Importantly, since this check is based on the public health dashboard, there
 are more accurate ways to monitor AWS. If you can, choose the {Amazon Web
 Service (AWS)} monitoring over this monitoring solution.

item:
 The name of the region.

discovery:
 One service is created for each region.
 Additionally, one service is created for global AWS services.
