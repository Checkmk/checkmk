title: AWS WAFV2: Web ACL Requests
agents: aws
catalog: cloud/aws
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the number of requests for Web ACLs based on the
 CloudWatch metrics "AllowedRequests" and "BlockedRequests". It reports
 the number of allowed and blocked requests as well as the sum of these
 two, which is the total number of requests. These metrics are reported
 as average rates measured in requests per second. Furthermore, the check
 also reports the percentage of allowed and blocked requests with respect
 to the total number of requests.

 There are no default levels for this check. Upper levels on the percentages
 can be configured using the rule "AWS/WAFV2 Web ACL Requests".

 To make this check work, you have to configure the related special
 agent {Amazon Web Services (AWS)}. Note that when configuring the agent,
 there is the option to include Web ACLs in front of CloudFront resources
 in the monitoring.
