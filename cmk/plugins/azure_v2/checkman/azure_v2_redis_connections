description:
  This check reports the number of current connections to a Microsoft Cache for
  Azure instance, along with the rate of newly created and closed connections.

  Note that the ability to use this plug-in depends on the "Cache SKU" chosen
  during deployment of the Redis cache. With the "Basic (No SLA)" SKU, the
  metrics used by this check plug-in always return "0" from the Azure API.

  The thresholds can be configured using the rule "Azure/Redis connections".

discovery: One service is created.
