description:
 This check monitors the total CPU utilization in percent on Cisco Security Management Appliance
 (SMA) as reported by the appliance software.

 The check creates a metric that is measured against configurable levels. Note that not all
 configuration options of the corresponding ruleset will have an effect on this check. In
 particular, any option related to individual CPU cores will have no effect, since no single-core
 data is available from the appliance.

 The check utilizes the OID perCentCPUUtilization (.1.3.6.1.4.1.15497.1.1.1.2)
 from ASYNCOS-MAIL-MIB.
