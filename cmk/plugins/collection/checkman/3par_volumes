description:
 This check measures the utilization of a virtual volume.

 There is information about

 - the used space of this virtual volume on the filer

 - the provisioning type

 - the associated WWN.

 - the compaction and/or deduplication ratio (if available)

 You can define thresholds for warning and critical (0 by default).
 If there is failed space above a configurable threshold the service goes
 to a {WARN} or {CRIT} state and shows the failed space.

 The service will also change the state if the virtual volume on
 the filer reports a degraded {WARN} or failed {CRIT} state.

 This check uses the 3PAR special agent.

item:
 Name of the volume.

discovery:
 One service is created for each virtual volume.
