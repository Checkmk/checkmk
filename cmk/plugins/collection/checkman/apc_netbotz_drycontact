description:
 This check monitors the status of dry contact sensors which are integrated in APC NetBotz Rack Monitor 200.

 The check compares the input's current state to the normal (no alarm) state configured on the device and alerts if they do not match.

 In case they do not match, the service state (OK, WARN, CRIT) will be based on the abnormal state severity configured on the device.

 This check uses the PowerNet-MIB.

discovery:
 One service is created for each sensor.

item:
 The input name and its index.
