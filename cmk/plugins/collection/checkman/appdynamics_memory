description:
 This check measures the {Heap} and {Non-Heap} memory usage of applications
 using the information collected by AppDynamics. Hence there is no need to
 query the application server itself.

 The WATO ruleset {JVM memory levels} applies {WARN}/{CRIT} levels to this check.

 The service goes {WARN}/{CRIT} if the memory usage exceeds these levels.

item:
 Name of the disk and either {{Heap}} or {{Non-Heap}}.

discovery:
 One service is created for each application and memory type (Heap, Non-Heap).
