description:
 Monitors memory and swap space on Arbor Peakflow, Peakflow SP and Peakflow TMS devices.

 {WARN}/{CRIT} levels can be configured through the rule
 "Memory and Swap usage on Arbor devices".

 The service goes {WARN}/{CRIT} if the space exceeds these levels.

 The device reports more detailed memory statistics in a generic
 MIB handled by hr_mem but that info is not officially supported
 and seems to report wrong data.

discovery:
 One service is created.
