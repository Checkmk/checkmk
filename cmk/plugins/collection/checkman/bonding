description:
 This plug-in monitors the current state of a bonding interface.
 If the total bonding state of the interface is down, then the
 check goes to {CRIT}, for status degraded it returns {WARN}.
 If at least one slave interface is down or not the expected slave
 is currently active, then the check gets {WARN}.

 If the bonding mode is according to IEEE 802.3ad (Dynamic link
 aggregation), the aggregation IDs are compared. A mismatch
 results in the configured state (default {WARN}).

 If the bonding mode does not match the expected bonding mode
 then the check goes to {CRIT} by default.

item:
 The team name of the bonding interface

discovery:
 One service is created for each {active} bonding interface.
 During inventory the current active interface is considered
 to be the primary interface.
 This is only relevant if you configure a detection of
 a change in the active interface.
