description:
 This checks monitors the signal quality of the optical ports of Brocade switches.
 It takes into account RX and TX power levels as well as the temperature at the port
 and, optionally, the same readings for all individual lanes.
 Currently, no user-defined levels are configurable, instead, Checkmk outputs the status
 reported by the device itself.

item:
 Port number of the interface. Depending on the length of the port number, it will be
 padded with {{0}}s.

discovery:
 One service is created for each port that fulfills the conditions configured in the rule
 "Network interface and switch port discovery". By default, these are interfaces which are
 currently found {up} and are of type 6, 32, 62, 117, 127, 128, 129, 180, 181, 182, 205 or
 229.

 Note that this check does not support all of the options offered by this rule. The grouping
 of interfaces is not supported and the items are always given by the port numbers, independently
 of the option chosen under "Appearance of network interface". Furthermore, out of the six
 matching conditions offered by the rule, this check supports only the following three: the
 matching of the port type, the matching of the port state and the matching of the interface
 description.
