description:
 This check monitors parameters of datacenter cooling devices
 using a SNMP interface made by CAREL, which is i.e. used in the
 Uniflair series of ACs.

 The check only monitors part of the data supported by the MIB
 since the MIB does not give info about potential values in
 some OIDs.

 The check queries and goes to {CRIT} for any of these values:
 the global status (this should catch any error)
 water loss (one of multiple water-related values),
 emergency operation mode (this is triggered following a
 failure, running at maximum performance)

 The check also queries the air humidity level, but currently
 does not allow setting a level on this.

discovery:
 One service is created.
