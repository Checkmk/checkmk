description:
 The CBL Airlaser is a device to transparently transport Gigabit Ethernet
 over an optical link with optional microwave fallback.

 The check queries a list containing all known power and temperature "status"
 information from the device.
 If one of the status OIDs indicates an error, the check will go to {WARN} or
 {CRIT} according to the error reported.
 For the temperature sensors, default values are included and can be adjusted.
 If these are exceeded, the check will also alert.

 Note: Monitoring rx/tx attentuation will be added after more testing.

discovery:
 One service is created for each remote device
 if the CBL-AIRLASOR-IP1000 MIB is supported.
