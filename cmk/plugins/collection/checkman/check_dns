description:
 This is an active check that sends a DNS query to a DNS nameserver.

 You can give the DNS name to query for. This can serve different purposes. For
 one, you can monitor whether a DNS server is operational. Another purpose is
 to check whether specific DNS queries are resolved in an expected manner. The
 DNS nameserver needs to be specified accordingly.

 It can compare the IP it gets back against a given IP and return {CRIT} if
 they do not match. It can check the DNS server to be authoritativ for the
 lookup. It can check response times against given thresholds for {WARN}
 and {CRIT}.

 This check can be configured by Wato.
