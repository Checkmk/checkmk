description:
 This performs an active check of an HTTP or HTTPS server.

 This is the new version and designated successor of the
 "HTTP/HTTPS Connection" active check.
 The feature set is mostly similar, but includes some new
 features like http2 support, TLSv1.3 support, and more
 precise input forms.
 It also allows to specify multiple connections to check per host.

 Please consider migrating to this active check, as the old
 one will be deprecated in a future version of Checkmk.

 This check can be configured via ruleset at Checkmk Setup.
 Please refer to the ruleset for details.
