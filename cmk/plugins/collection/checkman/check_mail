description:
 Logs in into an IMAP, POP3 or EWS mailbox to monitor whether or not the login is possible.
 An extended, optional, feature is, that the check can fetch all (or just some) mails
 from the mailbox and forward them as events to the Event Console.

 This check can be configured using WATO.
