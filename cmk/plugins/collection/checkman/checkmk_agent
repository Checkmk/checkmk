description:

 This plugin makes sure that the Checkmk agent deploy mechanism (if used) is working properly.
 It checks the time of the last successful connect to the deployment server and if there are any error messages.

 It also displays the number of deployed agent plugins and local checks. Furthermore, levels can be
 configured on the versions. For this to work, the versions must be included in the plugins / local
 checks in one of the standardised formats:
  * CMK_VERSION="2.1.0p12" (e.g. shell, php)
  * __version__=... (python)

 Together with the version requirements, users can also configure the monitoring state in case the
 version of a file is found but can not be parsed.

 Finally, the plugin also checks for duplicate agent plugins and local checks and goes to WARN if
 any duplicates are found.

 You can exclude files from the version and duplicate checks using regex patterns in the ruleset.

discovery:
 One service is created.
