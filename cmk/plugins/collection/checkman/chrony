title: Chrony: NTP Time Synchronization
agents: linux
catalog: os/services
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses the output of {chronyc tracking} in order to
 check the time synchronization when using {chrony}. The check
 is very similar to {ntp}, which monitors the {ntpd}, but it
 does not support jitter.

 You can set levels for the maximum stratum and for the time offset
 in milliseconds. The configuration is compatible with {ntp}.

 When {chrony} is not found running, the check goes to {CRIT}.

discovery:
 One service is created if chrony is running.
