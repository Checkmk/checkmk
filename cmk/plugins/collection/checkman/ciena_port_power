description:
 This check monitors

 - the input power

 - the output power

 transmitted by the transceiver.
 The powers are reported in dBm. Each of these powers are then compared to the alarm tresholds
 reported by the device. The check returns {CRIT} if either of the powers falls below or rises above
 an alarm treshold. Otherwise, the check returns {OK}. The device itself reports the power in
 microwatt, which is then converted to dBm.

 This check supports the Ciena 5171 Packetwave Platform and 5142 Service Aggregation Switch.

 The relevant MIBs are WWP-LEOS-PORT-XCVR-MIB and CIENA-CES-PORT-XCVR-MIB.

item:
 A unique index from the snmp table.

discovery:
 One service is created for each port reporting power measurements.
