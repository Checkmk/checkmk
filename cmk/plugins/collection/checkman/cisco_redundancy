 This check monitors the the status of the redundant unit of Cisco
 devices which support the CISCO-RF-MIB.

 At discovery the unit ID, unit state, peer ID, peer state and duplex mode
 are saved as parameters. At check period if the parameters are still the same
 the check is OK. If they have changed the service status will turn into WARN
 if unit or peer state is 'disabled', 'standby hot' or 'active', or CRIT otherwise.
 In these cases the reason for the last switch of activity will be reported.
 Independently if the peer state is 'not known' the state will be CRIT.

discovery:
 One service is created.
