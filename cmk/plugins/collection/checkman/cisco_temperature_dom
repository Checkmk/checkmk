description:
 This check monitors the transmit and receive power status and levels of
 Cisco Modular Access Routers.

 For more information about which devices are supported restrict the search on
 https://mibs.cloudapps.cisco.com/ITDIT/MIBS/MainServlet to MIBs {CISCO-ENVMON-MIB}
 and {CISCO-ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB}.

 Check status for transmit/receive power values:
 {OK}, {WARN}, {CRIT} and {UNKNOWN} are determined dependent on corresponding
 user levels configured in WATO rule {CISCO Digital Optical Monitoring (DOM)}
 or dependent on device specific level configuration. Refer to the help text of
 the WATO rule dropdown choices {Upper power levels} and {Lower power levels}
 for more information about how {WARN} and {CRIT} levels are determined.

item:
 The description of the sensor as provided by the device, or the ID of the sensor,
 if no description is available.

discovery:
 One service is created for each transmit and receive power level
 for every sensor withadmin state 'up'.
 Optionally it is possible to configure specific administration states ({up}, {down},
 {testing}) that should be discovered in the WATO discovery rule {Cisco DOM Discovery}.
