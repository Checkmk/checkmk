 Name of the memory unit

description:
 This check allows to monitor the operational status and presence of
 the memory in a Cisco UCS device. The check will report {OK} as long as the operational
 status is "operable", "removed" or "autoUpgrade". In other cases, the check will report
 a {WARNING} or {CRITICAL} status, based on the severity of the issue.
 The check will also report {WARNING} if the presence state is not "empty", "equipped",
 "missing", "equippedNotPrimary", "equippedSlave" or "equippedDiscInProgress".
 When the presence state is "missing", all other data will be ignored.

 Additionally, the plug-in checks and reports memory faults reported by the device.
 Acknowledged faults will be reported as {OK}. Otherwise, the monitoring state depends on
 the fault severity: "major" and "critical" are reported as {CRITICAL}, "warning" and
 "minor" as {WARNING} and "cleared" and "info" as {OK}.

discovery:
 One service is created for each memory device.
