description:
 Note: This check is obsolete, the individual temperatures (top, middle, bottom) are
   also available through the cmciii.temp_in_out check.
 This check monitors the temperature of the outflowing air of
 Rittal CMC-III LCP devices. Temperatures at top, middle and bottom
 of the device are captured, as well as the average value given
 by the device.
 No limits are set in the check, since limits are configured in the
 Rittal device itself. The state given by the Rittal device is
 taken as the state of the check as follows:
 If the Rittal device returns {OK}, the check is {OK}. Otherwise
 the check is {CRIT}.
 Furthermore, the lower and upper warning and critical limits configured
 in the device are extracted and used as limits for the
 average temperature read from the device.

discovery:
 One service is created for each sensor.
