description:
 Note: This check is obsolete. The same sensors are handled by cmciii.temp
   The rest of this man page is unchanged for legacy reasons:

 This check monitors the temperature of the inflowing and outgoing water of
 Rittal CMC-III LCP devices.  No limits are set in the check, since limits
 are configured in the Rittal device itself. The state given by the Rittal
 device is taken as the state of the check as follows: If the Rittal device
 returns {OK}, the check is {OK}. Otherwise the check is {CRIT}.  Furthermore,
 the lower and upper warning and critical limits configured in the device
 are extracted and used as limimts for the temperature read from the device.

discovery:
 Two services are created: {IN} and {OUT} if it detects a proper device.
