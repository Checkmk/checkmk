description:
 This check monitors the various FAN sensors on a Dell PowerConnect switch that supports
 the DELL-VENDOR-MIB. It will monitor the state of the FAN itself, depending on the
 state returned by the FAN.

 If a switch has more then one FAN sensor, it will create a service for EACH sensor.
 However, if a switch has any FANS that are not connected up to the sensor suite, or
 there is an empty FAN bay, they will not be picked up by this check.

 A FAN that is running normally will return an OK nagios state. Any FAN that
 are in a warning or is not present (if it was previously present) will return a WARNING
 nagios state. If a FAN is in a critical or is non-functional according to the sensor will
 return a CRITICAL nagios state. Lastly, if a FAN is in a "shutdown" state, it will return
 an UNKNOWN nagios state.

 Currently, testing has been completed with the Dell PowerConnect 5448 and 5424 models,
 however the service check may work with other models.

discovery:
 One service is created for each fan if the MIB
 defined above is supported on the switch.

item:
 Name of the fan

example:
 If a switch has 3 FANS in the device, it will create 3 service entries titled:

 Sensor fan1_unit1
 Sensor fan2_unit1
 Sensor fan3_unit1

 The fanX value represents the selected FAN, where as the unitX values represents the sensor
 assigned to the FAN. It is possible to have multiple sensors on a single FAN, though I have
 yet to see one.
