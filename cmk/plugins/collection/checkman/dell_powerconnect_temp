description:
 This check monitors the temperature inside Dell PowerConnect Switches which support the
 RADLAN-MIB/NetDiscover MIB. It will retreive the temperature (Celcius), and the state
 of the temperature sensor.

 A single service will be created showing the internal temperature at the time the check
 occurred However, two charts are created that plot the state of the sensor, and the
 value returned for the temperature.

 The state of the check will return an OK value if the sensor is working properly, otherwise
 it will return a WARNING state if the sensor is no longer available, or a CRITICAL state
 if the sensor becomes non-functional.

 The temperature can also trigger a WARNING or CRITICAL nagios state if the temperature
 exceeds the defined threshold values for each state.

 By default, the temperature returned by the SNMP check is returned in Degrees Celcius.

 The Dell PowerConnect manuals indicate the hardware can fail at any temperature over
 41 or 42 degrees Celcius, depending on the model.

 Currently, testing has been completed with the Dell PowerConnect 5448 and 5424 models,
 however the service check may work with other models.

item:
 The fixed statement {{Ambient}}

discovery:
 One service is created for the Temperature sensor if the MIB
 defined above is supported on the switch.
