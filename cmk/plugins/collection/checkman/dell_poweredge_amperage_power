description:
 This check monitors the power consumption of power units of Dell PowerEdge Servers.

 No limits are set in the check, since limits are configured in the device
 itself. The state given by the device is taken as the state of the check
 as follows: If the device returns {OK}, the check is {OK}. If the device returns
 {other}, {unknown}, {nonCriticalUpper} and {nonCriticalLower} a state of {WARN}
 is returned. Otherwise the check is {CRIT}.

 The check displays the upper warning and critical limits as configured in the device.
 Further limits are {not} displayed, even though they may be configured. These are
 UpperNonRecoverable, LowerCritical, LowerNonCritical and LowerNonRecoverable.
 These limits yet may lead to state changes, the corresponding states are honoured
 as outlined above.

item:
 The name of the location variable configured for the power unit

discovery:
 One service is created for each power unit.
