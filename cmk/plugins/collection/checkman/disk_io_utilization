description:
 This check monitors disk IO utilization for systems that provide
 a single percentage value.

 The value represents total disk IO utilization as reported by the system.
 Therefore, it may not represent 100% of the physical disk IO
 of the entire system as different systems can utilize different scaling.

 The created metric is checked against configurable levels.

 One service is created.
