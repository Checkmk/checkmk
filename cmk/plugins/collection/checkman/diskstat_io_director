description:
 This check measures the disk IO of volume directors.

 This check is compatible with {diskstat},
 but only supports {{throughput}}, no latency and queue lengths.

 The {WARN}/{CRIT} levels can be configured manually for each read and write.

 Please read further details in the man page of {diskstat}.

item:
 Either {"SUMMARY"} for a summarized check of alls items or the
 name of the disk device, e.g. {"hdisk15"}.

discovery:
  The discovery is configured via {Dist IO Levels}.
  If this is set to {"single"} (the default), then one service will be created for each disk.
  If it is set to {"summary"} then only one service per host will be created that has at least one hard disk.
