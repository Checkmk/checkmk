title: Docker: Node Disk Usage
agents: linux
catalog: containerization/docker
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the total and active number as well as the size and
 reclaimable size of containers, images, local volumes, and build cache.

 To make this check work the agent plugin {{mk_docker.py}} has to be installed.
 If you are using agent bakery rules, you must enable "Fully monitor the docker node"
 in the section "Docker node" (which is the default).
 If you are configuring the plugin via the configuration file, make sure you
 do not skip the section "docker_node_disk_usage" (again the default setting is fine).

item:
 Type of the docker node

discovery:
 One service is created for each type (i.e. containers, images, volumen, build cache).
