description:

 This check uses snmp to extract the following information about a Lotus
 Domino Server from the Notes-MIB: {lnNotesServerState} the overall
 state, {lnServerName} the server name, {lnMailDomain} the server domain,
 {lnServerNotesVersion} the Lotus Domino version.

 The state of the check is determined from the {lnNotesServerState}. A state of
 1:{up} leads to an OK state, states 2-4:{down, not_responding, crashed}
 lead to a critical state, otherwise the state is warning.

 No configuration and no limits can be set in this check.

discovery:
 One service is created for each record.
