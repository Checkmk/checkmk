title: IBM Lotus Domino: Count of Tasks
agents: snmp
catalog: app/lotusnotes

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses snmp to extract the list of currently running tasks
 on IBMs Lotus Domino Servers. It monitors the number of tasks
 matching a certain name or regular expression and checks it against
 warning and critical upper and lower levels.

item:
 A user definable service description.  The description must be unique
 within each host.  Changing the description will make Nagios think that it
 is another service.

discovery:
 One service is created for each task if one entry matches.
 Each entry found on target host processes is tried to be matched.
 The match configuration is done via {inv_domino_tasks_rules}.

cluster:
 On a cluster all processes are accumulated, along with the information
 on which node they are running.
 The percentual memory displayed is the quotient of the accumulated memory
 use of the processes and the accumulated total memory of every node the
 processes are running on.
