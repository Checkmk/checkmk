title: EMC Datadomain: Used Space of Filesystems via SNMP
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/storagehw/emc
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the usage of filesystems of the EMS Deduplication
 Storage Systems. It uses SNMP with the {Datadomain-MIB} to get its data.

 For configuration parameters and examples you may also refer to the man
 page of {df}. The check can be configured with the same WATO rule as the
 {df} check.

 The filesystems monitored by this check are different from the filesystems
 found by the hr_fs filesystem check for the same device. The latter are
 the ones found on the underlying operating system level of the device,
 whereas the filesystems monitored with this check are the filesystems of
 the Data Domain application.

item:
 The name of the filesystem as in {fileSystemResourceName} of the Data Domain
 MIB.

discovery:
 One service is created for each fixed disk.
