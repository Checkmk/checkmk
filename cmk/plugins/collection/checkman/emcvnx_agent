 agent controls.

 The check returns {CRIT} if an error is found in the agent section. Otherwise
 the check returns {OK}.

 Revsion" switch in the WATO rule "Check state of EMC VNX storage systems" or
 did call the special agent (as datasource program) with --modules option
 including "agent" module. If you are not interested in Model and Revision of
 your Storage device you can switch this off and save one call of naviseccli in
 every check interval.

 One service is created for each EMC VNX storage system called EMC VNX Agent.
