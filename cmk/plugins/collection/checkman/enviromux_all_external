description:
 This check monitors the temperature of all external sensors attached to
 NTI Enviromux 16D devices.
 It uses the allExternalSensorTable from the NTI Enviromux MIB (.1.3.6.1.4.1.3699.1.1.11.1.21.1).
 This service turns CRIT when a sensor temperature exceeds the device provided critical thresholds (from the allExternalSensorTable).
 If threshold levels are defined via the corresponding rule, the state is determined by those user settings instead -
 WARN at/above the warn level, CRIT at/above the crit level. If no rule thresholds are set, only the device thresholds apply.

item:
 The item is composed from the description and the sensor index.

perfdata:
 One graph for the Temperature.

discovery:
 One service is created for each available external temperature sensor.
