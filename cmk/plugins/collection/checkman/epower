description:
 This check monitors the output power (in Watt) of the (usually three) phases
 of an UPS.

 You can configure lower and upper levels for {WARN}/{CRIT}, both optional.
 Lower levels default to (20, 1), upper levels do not have default values for
 compatibility reasons.

 The service goes {WARN}/{CRIT} if the value for power is not in the range as
 specified above.

item:
 The index of the phase, e.g. {"1"}.

discovery:
 One service is created for each phase if the output power is not 0 or -1
