description:
 This check monitors the data relayed by the eWON router. This means that
 while this is an ewon check, the monitored device may be completely
 different.
 Each device type that can be connected has to be supported individually
 and currently the only supported device is the Wagner OxyReduct fire
 prevention system.
 Since the router doesn't allow for auto-discovery of the proxied device
 type, this has to be selected manually via wato.

 OxyReduct:
 This device provides 409 measures, many of which are 16-bit bitmasks so
 there. Most of these measures are handled in some way by this check but
 reported only if they imply a problem.
 In particular there are limits on the O2 percentage in the air of several
 rooms and count of various warning or incident messages.

item:
 One service is created for the state of the router.
 One service is created for each connected device called {{"oxyreduct"}}.
