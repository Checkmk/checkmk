title: F5 Big-IP: Active/Active or Passive/Active Cluster Status (> V11.2)
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/network/f5
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 The check queries the MIB tables of F5 BIG-IP loadbalancers (local traffic managers) to identify
 if the cluster correctly runs in an {active/active} or an {active/passive} setup.
 You can configure the expected behaviour via a WATO rule.
 It will issue a warning if the cluster setup differs from the expected setup.
 This check is expected to be run on cluster hosts, since it evaluates the state of multiple nodes.
 If you run this check on a cluster node, it will raise no warning if the cluster node state
 differs from {active}.

discovery:
 One service is created.

cluster:
  This check plugin is expected to be run on a cluster. See description above.
