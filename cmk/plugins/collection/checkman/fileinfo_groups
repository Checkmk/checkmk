title: Age, Size and Count of a Group of Files
agents: windows, linux, freebsd, macosx, solaris
catalog: os/files
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the size, age and the count of a group of files
 in the target host's filesystem.  You can set lower and upper
 limits for each: size of files, age of oldest, the newest file
 and for the total count of files.

 This check needs some configuration in the agent, as the agent needs to
 know the information about which files need to be sent.  Please refer to
 fileinfo's manpage for information about setting up the agent.

 The check also needs a configured file grouping pattern.  The name of the
 file group is referenced in the check configuration as the item.

 File grouping patterns combine a simple pattern based on {*} and {?} to
 join a subset of the file names send by the agent into a file group. In
 addition an {exclude} pattern may be defined to exclude certain filenames.

 Furthermore, the current time/date in a configurable format may be
 included in the pattern. The syntax is as follows: {$DATE:format-spec$},
 where {format-spec} is a list of time format directives of the unix date
 command.  Example: {$DATE:%Y%m%d$} is todays date, e.g. 20140127. A pattern
 of {/var/tmp/backups/$DATE:%Y%m%d$.txt} would search for .txt files with
 todays date as name in the directory /var/tmp/backups.

item:
 Configured name of the file group

discovery:
 One service is created for each fileinfo group.
