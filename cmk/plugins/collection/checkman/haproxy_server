description:

 This check monitors the status of the backends of the HAProxy loadbalancer
 for TCP and HTTP connections. It requires the mk_haproxy.freebsd agent
 plug-in to be installed on the FreeBSD host to be monitored. On linux it
 works with the standard agent.

 Mapping between backend status and monitoring states can be parametrized. By default,
 the check is {OK} if the backend indicates the status {UP} and {CRIT} otherwise.

item:
 The name of backend.

discovery:
 One service is created for each backend.
