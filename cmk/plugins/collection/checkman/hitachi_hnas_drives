description:
 This check monitors the status of system drives of Hitachi NAS-Devices.
 It was tested against Hitachi HNAS Modell 3090 but probably will work
 for other HNAS devices using the BlueArc MIB.

 The check works by scanning the SNMP status information of all system drives
 as given by the device. It displays the number of drives found in each of the
 known states - if it is non-zero.  Known states are: "Online", "MBR corrupt",
 "Failed and unaccessible", "Not present", "Not accessible by controller",
 "Offline", "Initializing", "Formatting", "Unknown",

 All stati except "Online" and "Unknown" trigger a {CRIT} state of
 the service.  "Online" triggers {OK} and "Unknown" triggers {UNKNOWN}

discovery:
 One service for each drive.
