description:
 Checks the status of Physical Nodes (PNodes) in Hitachi HNAS storage systems.
 It was tested against Hitachi HNAS Modell 3090 but probably will work
 for other HNAS devices too - give it a try.

 Returns {OK} if the reported state is "up" or "online". Returns {WARN} on
 state "notUp". Returns {CRIT} on state "dormant" or "dead" and
 {UNKN} on every other state.

discovery:
 One service is created for each PNode in the HNAS system.

item:
 If SNMP returns a name of the PNode, the item is build up combining the ID
 and this name. Otherwise it's just the ID.
