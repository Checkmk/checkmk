description:
 Checks the status of Power Supplies (PSUs) in Hitachi HNAS storage systems.
 It was tested against Hitachi HNAS Modell 3090 but probably will work
 for other HNAS devices too - give it a try.

 Returns {OK} if the reported state is "ok". Returns {WARN} on state "notFitted".
 Returns {CRIT} on state "failed" and {UNKN} on every other state.

discovery:
 One service is created for each PSU in the HNAS system.

item:
 The ID of the PNode plus the ID of the PSU, separated by a dot. E. g. 1.2
