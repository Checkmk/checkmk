description:
 Checks the status of Virtual Nodes (VNodes, also called EVS) in Hitachi
 HNAS storage systems.
 It was tested against Hitachi HNAS Modell 3090 but probably will work
 for other HNAS devices too - give it a try.

 Returns {OK} if the reported state is "onLine". Returns {CRIT} on state
 "offLine" and {UNKN} on every other state.

 The PNode it runs on and the admin status are displayed just for info.

discovery:
 One service is created for each VNode in the HNAS system.

item:
 If SNMP returns a name of the VNode, the item is build up combining the ID
 and this name. Otherwise it's just the ID.
