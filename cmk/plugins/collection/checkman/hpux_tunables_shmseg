title: Kernel Tunables: Number of Shared Memory Segments
agents: hpux
catalog: os/kernel
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check allows for monitoring of admin-tunable kernel limits on HP-UX
 systems that support the {"kcusage"} command. The command should be available
 from HP-UX 11.20 to the current 11.31.

 The check uses the output of {kcusage -l} for monitoring the
 current number of shared memory segments (semmns). Per default this
 check is always {OK}, but you can set levels for the used
 percentage.

discovery:
 All hpux_tunable checks are combined in one service.
 One {hpux_tunable} service for each supported tunable.
