description:
 This check monitors the stack composition of Huawei switches and the roles of its members.

 The stacking function allows multiple devices to be connected together to logically function as one device.

 There are three kinds of roles that members of a stack can be in: "master", "standby" and "slave".

 If the current role of a member is different from when it was discovered the state of the service changes to CRIT.

item:
 The stack member number and the entity number seperated by a {{/}}

discovery:
 One service is created for each stack member.
 This check does not discover any services if the stacking function is disabled.
