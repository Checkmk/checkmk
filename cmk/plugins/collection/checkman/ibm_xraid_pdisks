description:
 This check monitors the state of the physical disks on a
 IBM xSeries / SystemX PC-based server that has the IBM SNMP
 management software installed.
 It can be used for "agentless" monitoring of disk failures,
 and should even work with different types of raid controllers
 in the same server. (It is only tested on a system with
 one Adaptec-based controller)
 The check verifies a disk has not {disappeared}, and will go
 to {CRIT} otherwise. If there is status data for the disk the
 check will return {CRIT} for a dead disk, {WARN} for a disk
 that is rebuilding and {OK} if the disk is active.

item:
 A combination of the controller, enclosure and the slot number, separated by
 a slash, for example {"1/0/4"} for controller {1}, enclosure {0} and slot {4}.
 The naming is chosen to be compatible with the megaraid_pdisks check, so in
 dual monitoring one of them needs to be disabled using {disabled_checks}.

discovery:
 One service is created for each disk.
