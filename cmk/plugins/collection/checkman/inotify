description:
 This check evaluates the data reported by the {mk_inotify} plug-in on the target system.
 The target system requires the {pyinotify} python module to be installed.
 Inotify allows you to monitor certain file operations, i.e. {access}, {open}, {create}, etc.
 In the agent bakery, you can configure which files and/or folders to monitor and specify
 which operation(s) to listen to.
 You can also configure levels relating to the age of the last operation so that
 you can check the last modified age.

item:
 {{file}} or {{folder}} and its path.

discovery:
 One service is created for each explicitly specified file and folder in the {mk_inotify.cfg}.
