 Do not use this plugin. It will be removed soon. Use jolokia_metrics instead.

 This checks uses the JSON HTTP service of j4p (from jmx4perl) to
 monitor the number of threads created by a Java application server like
 Tomcat or JBoss. You can define levels against the number of threads
 of the Java machine.

 Take a look at the {j4p_performance.mem} manpage for instructions
 on how to set up the needed agent plugin.

item:
 The instance name as configured in {j4p.conf} with the variable
 {instance}.

discovery:
 One service is created for each JMX instance sent by the agent.
