description:
 This check monitors state and performance information of any program
 call, for example regular running cronjobs on Linux, AIX or Solaris.

 The check uses information provided by the wrapper program {mk-job} and is {CRITICAL} if the exit code of the job is not {0}, or if
 warning or critical limits for the job age have been reached. Other mappings
 of exit code to check state can be defined in the check parameters.

 Limits can be configured with WATO.

 This check is also cluster-aware and worst or best state is configurable.
 Default is worst state.

item:
 The identifier of the job defined by the first argument to {mk-job}.

discovery:
 One service is created for each job.
