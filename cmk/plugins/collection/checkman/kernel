title: Various Linux Kernel Counters
agents: linux
catalog: os/kernel
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors various counters as found in {/proc/stat}
 and {/proc/vmstat}. Examples for those counters are {ctxt}
 (the number of process context switches per second), {pgmajfault}
 (the number of major page faults per second) and {processes}
 (the number of process creations per second).

 You can set a critical and warning level on each of those
 counters or just monitor them without levels in order to
 collect performance data. Levels you set to {None} will not
 be checked.

item:
 The kernel counter

discovery:
 One service is created for {"Major Page Faults"}, {"Context Switches"}
 and {"Process Creations"} per default on each host.
 You can override this list globally by setting {inventory_kernel_counters}
 to a list of strings with those counters that should be inventorized.
 Use {ignored_services} if you need a host-specific configuration
 of the inventory.
