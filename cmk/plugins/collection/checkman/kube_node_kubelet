description:
 This check monitors the health of the kubelet running on the
 corresponding node. If the healthz endpoint returns a status code
 other than 200, the service is {CRIT} and the verbose output of
 said endpoint is shown in details. Otherwise, the service is {OK}.

 In environments where node proxy permissions are restricted (such as GKE),
 the kubelet service is not created to avoid a permanent {CRIT} state.
 Additionally, PVC monitoring won't be possible in such environments.

 This check works for the nodes of a Kubernetes cluster.

 The check requires that the special agent kube is configured.

discovery:
 One service is created per node.
