description:
 A pod's status depends on an array of PodConditions through which the
 Pod has or has not yet passed. This check monitors the status of each
 condition (scheduled, initialized, containersready and ready) and the
 duration if the condition has not yet passed. This check does not
 monitor custom conditions.

 Upper levels for {WARN}/{CRIT} can be defined for time until a
 condition is not yet passed.

discovery:
 One service is created representing pod conditions.
