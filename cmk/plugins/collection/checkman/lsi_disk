title: LSI RAID Controller: Status of a Disk
agents: linux
catalog: os/storage
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 Monitors the status of a single disk of an LSI RAID controller. The Linux
 agent sends information about its state, if the tool {cfggen} is
 available. Each disk can be in one of several states, such as
 {ONL} (online), {HSP} (hot spare), {FLT} (faulty) or {MIS} (missing).
 The check is parameterized with a target state. The check gets
 critical if the disk is not in that state or no information about
 the disk is sent at all by the agent.

item:
 The ID of the disk

discovery:
 One service is created for each existing disk regardless of their states.
 The current state of a disk is used as target state.
 That way, you will be notified, even if a disk changes from state {HSP} to {ONL}.
