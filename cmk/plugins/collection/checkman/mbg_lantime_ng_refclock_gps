description:

 This check monitors the refclock state of Meinberg LANTIME clocks supporting
 the new MBG-LANTIME-NG-MIB. It is only applied to GPS refclocks. Other
 refclocks have their own subcheck.

 The check handles the reported state of the refclock and provides additional information
 about its state, like the number of satellites.

 When the refclock state is "not available" CRIT is raised and a WARN state is issued
 if the refclock state is "not synchronized".
 If the number of good satellites drops below 3 and the device substate indicates that
 a satellite connection is necessary, a CRIT state is raised. If the substate indicates
 that no satellite connection is necessary no information about satellites is shown.
 Substates that require a satellite connection are "GPS sync", "GPS tracking",
 "GPS antenna disconnected", "GPS warm boot", "GPS cold boot",
 "GPS antenna short circuit" and "MRS GPS sync".

discovery:
 One service is created for eachr GPS refclock.

item:
 The index number of the refclock.
