 This check monitors the general state of Meinberg LANTIME clocks supporting the
 New MBG-LANTIME-NG-MIB.

 The check handles the reported state of the device, the stratum and the refclock
 state.

 The check raises a {CRITICAL} when the clock is in state {notSynchronized} or
 {notAvailable}. It also handles bad stratums and refclock offsets which can be
 configured. The refclock offset can either be a positive or negative integer.

 One service is created for each device.
