description:
 This check monitors the general state of Meinberg LANTIME clocks supporting the
 MBG-SNMP-MIB::mbgLantime ({1.3.6.1.4.1.5597.3.1}) MIB. The check has been
 developed with a GPS170 M3x lantime V5.30k.

 The check handles the reported state of the device, the stratum and the refclock
 state.

 The check raises a {CRITICAL} when the clock is in state {notSynchronized} or
 {noGoodRefclock}. It also handles bad stratums and refclock offsets which can be
 configured. The refclock offset can either be a positive or negative integer.


discovery:
 One service is created for each device.
