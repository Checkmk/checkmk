title: MongoDB: Collection Size
agents: linux
catalog: app/mongodb
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the size parameters of MongoDB collections:

 - Collection size: The total uncompressed size in memory of all records in a collection. The size does not include the size of any indexes associated with the collection

 - Storage size: The total amount of storage allocated to this collection for document storage.

 - Total index size: The total size of all indexes

 Note: If the MongoDB is running as a replica set, this check is not discovered
 on the same host where the {mk_mongodb} plugin is installed. The data is piggybacked
 to a pseudo host named after the replica set name, intead.

item:
 The name of the database followed by {{.}} followed by the name of the collection

discovery:
 One service is created for each collection.
