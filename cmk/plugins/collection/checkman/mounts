title: Options of Mounted Filesystems
agents: linux
catalog: os/storage
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the options with which a filesystem is mounted by
 using the output of {/proc/mounts}. In normal operation mount options
 should never change. In recent versions of Linux (e.g. UBUNTU oneiric),
 the mount option {commit=} may change automatically depending
 on the current battery state, so this option is being excluded from
 the monitoring. Also excluded is the option {localalloc=} for recent
 kernels and OCFS2 filesystems.

 This check goes critical if the mount option {ro} appears. This
 might indicate IO errors have occurred, causing the filesystem
 to switch to read-only mode.

 Any other change of mount options will trigger a warning state.

 If the filesystem is not being found mounted, the check returns
 an {UNKNOWN} state.

item:
 The mount point of the filesystem.

discovery:
 One service is created for each filesystem which is not of the type {tmpfs}.
 The inventory uses the current mount options as check parameter.
 Note: the agent sends only filesystems which have a device below
 {/dev}, so network filesystems and virtual filesystems are excluded
 by the agent.
