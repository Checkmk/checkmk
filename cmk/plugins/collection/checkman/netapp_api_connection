description:
 This check and the associated special agent (agent_netapp) are deprecated
 and will be removed in a future version.

 Please configure the new special agent using the "NetApp via Ontap REST API" ruleset.

 This check simply shows any connection problems with the netapp filer.
 This might be because of insufficient user permissions or missing licenses on the target system.
 These problems are shown as warnings in the plug-in output. A WATO rule allows you
 to down- or upgrade this warning to a different state.
