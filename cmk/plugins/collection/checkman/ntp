description:
 This check uses the output of {ntpq -p} as sent by the agent. It is
 a list of all NTP peers with their state, stratum, offset and jitter.
 The check gets critical if the time offset exceeds a configurable level,
 if the stratum is too high or on othe error conditions. It gets UNKNOWN
 if the peer is unreachable or has not answered for a long time.

 Note: This check creates one individual service for each peer. It is useful
 for monitoring the health of the peers. If you want to monitor only the
 time of the NTP client, you might rather use {ntp.time}.

item:
 The name or IP address of the peer (first column in output of {ntpq -p}.

discovery:
 One service is created for each peer which has been contacted at least once
 if in the rule {NTP Discovery} the mode is set to {"detailed"} or {"both"}.
 One summary service of type {ntp.time} is created if the mode is
 set to {"summary"}.
