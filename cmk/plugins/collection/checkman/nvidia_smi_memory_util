title: NVIDIA Graphics Card: Memory utilization

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This checks monitors the memory utilization of an NVIDIA graphics card
 using the command line tool {nvidia-smi}.
 The check only works if that tool is installed.

 The total memory utilization is calculated by adding up FB and BAR1 memory utilization.
 FB memory is the on-board frame buffer memory.
 BAR1 memory is used to map the FB memory so it can be directly accessed by the CPU or by 3rd party devices.
 Both of these values are also individually monitored.

 You can configure upper levels for all three types of memory utilization (Total, FB, BAR1).

item:
 PCI bus ID of the graphics card

discovery:
 One service is created for each available graphics card if the necessary
 values to calculate gpu utilization are available.
