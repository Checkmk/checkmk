description:
 This checks monitors temperature sensors reported by the tool
 OpenHardwareMonitor (http://openhardwaremonitor.org/). check_mk
 includes a stripped down version of OpenHardwareMonitor without
 a gui component which can be installed through the agent backery
 or manually.
 If the check_mks own version of ohm is used and installed correcty,
 the windows agent will ensure it is run (and restarted) as
 necessary.

 All temperature sensors (cpu, hdd, ...) are handled through this
 same check but different default levels are applied based on
 device type:

 - CPU:     60, 70 degree celcius

 - HDD:     40, 50 degree celcius

 - others:  70, 80 degree celcius

item:
 The name of the sensor as reported by OpenHardwareMonitor

discovery:
 One service is created for each available sensor with the sensor type ("Temperature").
