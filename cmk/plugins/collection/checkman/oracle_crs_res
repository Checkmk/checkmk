title: Oracle Clusterware: Cluster Resources
agents: linux, aix, solaris, hpux
catalog: app/oracle

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check needs the agent pluing mk_oracle_crs from our plugin directory.
 After copying to the agent plugin directory, Checkmk will find all resources
 of a running Oracle Clusterware/Grid-Infrastructure or Restart.

 All resources are stale when RA-GI ora.cssd Resource is CRIT to reduced
 notifications.

 A resource is CRIT when STATE <> TARGET_STATE.

 This checks needs a lot of clusterrules in WATO, because every resource
 from Oracle Clusterware/Grid-Infrastructure is found when inventory is
 started.
 A failover resource is stale on the failover nodes and only checked on
 the active node. Don't forget rules for these resources.

 Every Service with [local resource] are only checked on the node where
 the agent result came from. These resources are no cluster resource and
 they don't need any clusterrule in WATO!

 This plugin is tested against Oracle Grid-Infrastructure, Oracle Restart
 11.2 and 12.1.

item:
 Name of Resource

discovery:
 One service is created for each resource.
