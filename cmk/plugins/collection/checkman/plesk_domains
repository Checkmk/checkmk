agents: linux

distribution: check_mk
description:
 Plesk is a commercial webhosting management software. It allows you to
 manage multiple independent webspace instances including domains and
 so on.

 This check simply outputs all domains configured in a local plesk
 installation. It raises a {WARNING} state when no domain is configured,
 otherwise the plug-in is always reporting an {OK} state.

 To make this check work you need to install:

 * the agent plugin {plesk_domains} on the host which runs Plesk in the directory {/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins}.
 * the Python package MySQLdb (e.g. via `pip install mysqlclient` or `apt install python3-mysqldb`).

discovery:
 One service is created for each system.
