description:
 This check tracks the space used by a PostgreSQL database
 The check has no alarm levels since PostgreSQL databasizes don't have a
 size limit. (Single table limit is 32TB, too)

 This check relies on data reported by the agent-side plugin {mk_postgres}

item:
 Name of the category and the name of the database

discovery:
 One service is created for each database.
