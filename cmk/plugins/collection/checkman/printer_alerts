description:
 This check monitors the alerts reported by printers supporting the
 {PRINTER-MIB}. The check generates one service per device.  For every
 active printer alert group ({prtAlertGroup}) it determines the alert code
 ({prtAlertCode}) and displays a textual representation of the alert code.
 If available on the device, it also displays a description of the alert.

 The state of the check is determined from a table defining the relation between
 the alert code and the state of the check. This table is hardcoded. If you find
 any possible improvements or shortcomings of the table, feel free to contact us.

discovery:
 One service is created for each device.
