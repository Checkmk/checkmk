description:
 This check monitors the remaining level of a printer's supplies, such as toner, fuser, or waste box.
 The printer must support the generic PRINTER-MIB.
 The default check levels are 20% (warning) and 10% (critical) of the full supply level.
 According to the PRINTER-MIB, it is possible that a printer cannot determine the exact remaining amount in a supply and instead reports "some remaining."
 This status will result in a warning. However, this is customizable via service parameter.
 Some printers may report a supply level in an unsusual way, e.g., used ink instead of remaining, or space left in waste box instead of space used.
 The check can't detect this situation, but you can correct the value by applying the service parameter {Upturn supply levels}.

 For OKI c5900 devices, the names of the supply units are not unique.
 For example, one supply might be named {Toner Cartridge OKI DATA CORP}. In such cases, the color of the supply unit is added to the beginning of the name to create a unique item name.

item:
 The description of the printer supply unit.

discovery:
 One service is created for each supply unit with a unique name.
 The service always shows remaining supply. E.g., remaining ink, remaining space in waste box.
