description:
 This check monitors the state of the plugs of the Raritan PX-2000
 family of intelligent rack power distribution units (iPDUs).
 It has been tested with the model PX2-2180CR.
 As default the state of the time from inventory will result in the state {OK},
 other states are in the state {CRIT}.
 The required state can be configured to {on}, {off} or {None} (default).
 When the required state is set to None, the service will compare the
 current state with the state found during discovery.
 Plugs are considered {OK} when their current state matches the required
 or discovered state (required state takes precedence), and {CRIT} otherwise.

item:
 The ID of the plug as given by the device

discovery:
 One service is created for each plug.
