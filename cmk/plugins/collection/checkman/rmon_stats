title: Traffic Analysis of Network Interfaces Using RMON
agents: snmp

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check extracts data from the RMON statistics group of RMON enabled network
 interfaces. The data are described in the Remote MONitoring MIB. Several devices
 of various vendors are capable of supplying RMON data via SNMP, among them
 are some CISCO devices. It may be necessary to enable RMON for every single network
 interface you want to gather information for.

 The check always returns the state {OK}. The main purpose of the check is to gather
 network traffic statistics as performance data.

item:
 The ID of the network interface within RMON (etherStatsIndex)

discovery:
 The discovery of services has to be specifically activated for this check (ruleset
 "Monitor RMON statistics"). By default, no services are discovered. If activated,
 one service is created for each network port for which RMON is activated.
