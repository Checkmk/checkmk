description:

 This check shows the allocated pool size, whether the dynamic pool is running, and whether the cache is in ReadWrite mode.
 If the dynamic pool not running, {CRIT} will be reported.
 If the cache is not in ReadWrite mode, {CRIT} will be reported.
 It is possible to set levels to check the allocated size using the ruleset "Sansymphony pool allocation".
 Magic factor can be used to adjust these levels dynamically based on the overall pool size.
 Please refer to the user guide for more information on magic factor.

 The windows agent needs to be extended with the agent plugin sansymphony.ps1.
 In order to use magic factor, the agent plugin must be version 2.2.0 or higher.
