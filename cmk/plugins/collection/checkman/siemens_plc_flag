description:
 The check monitors the state of binary flag values (single bits) reported by Siemens PLC (SPS) devices.

 You need to use and configure the special agent {agent_siemens_plc} which is using the SNAP7
 library to communicate with the Siemens PLC. When you are using OMD, everything is already
 installed and configured. In manual setups, you will need to ensure that the snap7 library
 and python module {snap7} are installed.
 To make temperature values available for the check, you need to configure the memory addresses
 and data types to read from the device as temperature values.

 By default the check reports {OK} for bits set to 1 and {CRIT} for bits set to 0, but you
 can configure the check to handle them vice versa.

item:
 Name of the device and the mode seperated by a space

discovery:
 One service is created for each configured flag value.
