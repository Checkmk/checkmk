description:
 This check tests S.M.A.R.T. health reported by snmp-enabled devices
 from supermicro.
 Currently this has only been tested with data from a mainboard on
 windows. In this case an agent has to be enabled through the
 SuperDoctor III software.

 Status {OK} and {CRIT} are relayed directly from the device,
 a {WARN} may work but is not documented.
 Status may also become {UNKNOWN} if the necessary driver is
 uninstalled.

item:
 Name of the device

discovery:
 One service is created for each SMART-enabled harddisk.
