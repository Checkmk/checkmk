description:
 This check monitors the state of linux services provided by
 the systemctl command 'systemctl --all'.
 The check reports the 'active' attribute of the discovered services
 and their description. The state mapping is configurable, by default
 active and inactive states are OK, failed and all others are CRIT.

item:
 The service unit name.

discovery:
 By default, no services are discovered. For a systemd service to be discovered
 it has to match the conditions in the ruleset "Systemd single services
 discovery". Moreover, only systemd units listed by 'systemctl --all' are
 considered. It is not sufficient for the systemd service to be listed by
 'systemctl list-unit-files'. Note, that even if a systemd unit is 'loaded',
 this does mean it will be listed by 'systemctl --all'.
