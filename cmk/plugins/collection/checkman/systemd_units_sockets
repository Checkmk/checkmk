description:
 This check monitors the state of linux sockets provided by
 the systemctl command 'systemctl --all'.
 The check reports the 'active' attribute of the discovered sockets
 and their description. The state mapping is configurable, by default
 active and inactive states are OK, failed and all others are CRIT.

item:
 The socket unit name.

discovery:
 By default, no sockets are discovered. For a socket to be discovered it has to
 match the conditions in the ruleset "Systemd single socket discovery".
 Moreover, only systemd units listed by 'systemctl --all' are considered. It is
 not sufficient for the socket to be listed by 'systemctl list-unit-files'.
 Note, that even if a systemd unit is 'loaded', this does not mean it will be
 listed by 'systemctl --all'.
