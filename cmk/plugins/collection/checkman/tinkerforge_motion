description:
 This check monitors motion detector bricklets on any tinkerforge stack.
 For this check the time ranges during which movement shouldn't occur
 can be configured.
 Outside these times, a motion would be mentioned in the infotext but
 the state remains {OK}.
 Please note that the sensor has two hardware "wheels" to control its
 sensitivity and how long, after motion ended, the motion detector will
 remain in its warning states.
 check_mk can not influence these values.

item:
 The bricks position inside the stack.

discovery:
 One service is created for each motion detector bricklet.
