title: UCD SNMP Daemon: CPU Utilization
agents: snmp
catalog: os/kernel

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check measures the CPU utilization during the last check
 cycle.
 Levels can be set on {wait} (disk wait) and the utilization.
 If you want to set levels on your CPU load you better use the check
 {ucd_cpu_load}.

 The information is fetched via SNMP from the UCD SNMP daemon.
 This daemon is mainly found on Linux and is used by some
 hardware appliances (such as Riverbed Steelhead).

discovery:
 One service is created for each host if the agent supports the UCD-MIB.
 Currently the SNMP scan function will only consider hosts
 with the text {linux} in their system description. You can
 try an explicit inventory with {cmk --checks ucd_cpu_util -I HOSTNAME}
 if that is not the case.
