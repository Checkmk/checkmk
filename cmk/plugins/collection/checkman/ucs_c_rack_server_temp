 - Cisco UCS C220 M4 Rack Server

 - Cisco UCS C240 M4 Rack Server

 - Cisco UCS C460 M4 Rack Server

 This check does not support the C-Series Rack Server model "Cisco UCS C125 M5 Rack Server Node"
 which is used as part of a "Cisco UCS C4200 Series Rack Server Chassis".

 Check status:

 - {OK} in case the monitored temperature is within the configured valid temperature range.

 - {WARN} in case the monitored temperature is equal or higher than the configured warn value.

 - {CRIT} in case the monitored temperature is equal or higher than the configured crit value.
