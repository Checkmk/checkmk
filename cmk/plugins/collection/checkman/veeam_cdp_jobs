description:
 This check monitors the status of the Continuous Data Protection (CDP) jobs
 run by Veeam. If the job is not disabled, the check also monitors the time
 since last execution.

 In order to carry out the check, the Veeam agent plugin
 needs to be installed on the backup server. See special instructions in the
 comment section of the two Veeam agent plugin scripts on how to install
 the scripts.

 - This service is {OK} if the result of the job is {Running} or {Disabled}.

 - It goes {CRIT} if the result of the backup is {Failed} or {Stopped}.

 - It goes {UNKNOWN} in all other cases.

 You can also configure upper thresholds for the age of the last CDP run.
 The defaults are {WARN}: 1 day 6 hours and {CRIT}: 2 days.

discovery:
 One service is created for each CDP job created by the Veeam tool.

item:
 The name of the CDP job.
