description:
 This check monitors the status of the backups jobs run by the Veeam
 backup tool. In order to carry out the check, the Veeam agent plugin
 needs to be installed on the backup server. See special instructions in the
 comment section of the two Veeam agent plug-in scripts on how to install
 the scripts.

 This check is {OK} if the result of the backup is Success. It is {WARN} if the
 result of the backup is Warning. It is {CRIT} if the result of the backup is
 Failed. It is {OK} or {UNKNOWN} if the result of the backup is None. This then
 depends on the state of the last backup.

discovery:
 One service is created for each backup job created by the Veeam tool.

item:
 The name of the backup job.
