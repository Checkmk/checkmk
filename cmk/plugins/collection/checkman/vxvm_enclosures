description:
 This check verifies status of disk enclosures or arrays
 connected to a host running Veritas VxVM.

 It is in status {OK} an enclosure is in status CONNECTED.
 Any other status will be reported as a {CRIT} status, assuming
 the enclosure has lost connectivity or has been removed.
 Veritas also lists the local disks of a system in a
 "pseudo-enclosure" named {OTHER_DISKS}. If you do not run
 the local disks under Veritas control, you can add these to
 {ignored_services}.

 You need to install the agent plugin {vxvm}.

item:

discovery:
 One service is created for each VxVM disk enclosure.
