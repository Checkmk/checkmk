description:
 This check is used to track the status of objects in Veritas VxVM.
 Currently, it can only track the status of {v} - Volume level objects.
 It will be {OK} if a volume is an active status, or if it was
 dismounted/stopped cleanly by admin action. If any other status is
 detected, it will go to {CRIT}.

 If a diskgroup goes to {disabled} by catastrophic failure or admin
 error, the check can no longer report the volume status, as the
 volumes as objects become unavailable.

 The check should be extensible for tracking status in multiple layers.

 You need to install the agent plugin {vxvm}.

item:
 Name of the diskgroup

discovery:
 One service is created for each volume in the volume manager.

 Layered volumes {v2} are included. If you do not need data on
 these use {ignored_services} to exclude them from monitoring.
