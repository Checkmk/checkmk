title: Zypper: (Security) Updates
agents: linux
catalog: os/misc
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check checks for available updates via {zypper} and SLES
 and OPENSUSE distributions. You need to install the plug-in {mk_zypper}
 into the {plugins} directory of your agent.

 The check gets critical if there are security updates available.
 It gets warning, if there are other updates available or if package
 locks exist (created by {zypper addlock}). This is configurable via
 the rule {Zypper Updates}.

discovery:
 One service is created for each system where the {mk_zypper}
 plug-in produces a non-empty output.
