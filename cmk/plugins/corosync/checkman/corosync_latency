description:
 This check plug-in monitors the Corosync latency.
 It checks the maximum and average latency of all links.

 The upper levels for average and maximum latency are
  configurable via the ruleset Corosync Latency.
 If a link is connected but provides no latency samples,
 the link is skipped and no service is discovered.

discovery:
 One service per Link is created.

item:
 The item name is constructed as {hostname}.{link_name}, e.g. node1.link0
