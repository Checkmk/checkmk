description:
 This check uses the contents of {/proc/drbd} as sent by the Checkmk linux
 agent. The check records the statistic counter of each DR:BD device.

 These counters are handled by this check: al (activity log updates),
 bm (bit map updates), lo (local count requests), pe (pending requests),
 ua (unacknowledged requests), ap (application pending requests),
 ep (epoch objects), wo (write order), oos (KiB out of sync)

 At the moment this check does not use any thresholds. So it reports {OK}
 all the time.

item:
 The name of the DRBD device e.g. drbd0

discovery:
 One service is created for each configured DRBD device.
 All devices with the connection state "Unconfigured" are skipped.
