description:
 This check uses the special agent for Elasticsearch. The document count and
 size growth per minute will be recorded and averaged for a set amount of time
 (30 minutes by default). The last recent document count growth and size growth
 will be compared to this average value. Thresholds can be set on how much higher
 the last recent growth can be compared to the average growth.

discovery:
 By default, one service is created for each index. Using the discovery ruleset
 "Discovery of Elasticsearch indices", multiple indices can be accumulated into
 a single service. This can be used to for example combine the indices
 my-index-2021.01, my-index-2021.02 and my-index-2021.03 into a single service
 called my-index.

item:
 The name of the index or the group (if grouping is configured).
