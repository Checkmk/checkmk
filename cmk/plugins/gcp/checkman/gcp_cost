description:
 This check monitors cost of gcp projects. It shows the accumulated costs of
 the current month. At the start of each month, the check will thus return 0.

 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Google Cloud Platform (GCP)}.

 There are no default levels. Upper levels
 are configurable via the rule "GCP Cost".

discovery:
 One service is created for each project id in cost data.
