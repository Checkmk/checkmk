description:
 This check monitors the requests of an external HTTP(S) load balancer.

 - 50th, 95th and 99th percentile of the total latency measured.

 The total latency is the time from when the request is received by the
 external HTTP(S) load balancer proxy to when the proxy received ACK from the
 client on the last response byte.

 To make this check work you have to configure the related
 special agent {Google Cloud Platform (GCP)}.

 Upper levels on a chosen percentile are configurable
 via the rule "GCP/HTTP(S) load balancer latencies".

discovery:
 One service is created per load balancer.
