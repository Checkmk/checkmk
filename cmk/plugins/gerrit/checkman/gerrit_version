description:
 This check compares a currently deployed Gerrit instance with newer available releases.

 Since Gerrit uses a release cycle similar to semantic versioning, this check can monitor when
 a major, minor, or patch release is available. With the service configuration, a user can specify
 the specific type of release(s) they would like to be notified about.

 Requires the integration "Gerrit" to be configured.

discovery:
 One service is created ({"Gerrit Version"}).
