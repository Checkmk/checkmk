description:
 This check monitors the checkpoints (snapshots) of virtual machines running on a Microsoft Hyper-V cluster.

 The check queries a Microsoft Hyper-V cluster via an agent plug-in and reports
 the status and age of VM checkpoints. It monitors checkpoint creation dates and
 can alert when checkpoints become too old, which may indicate maintenance issues
 or potential storage concerns.

 The check tracks both the newest and oldest checkpoints, providing visibility into
 checkpoint management practices. It calculates the age of checkpoints from their
 creation timestamp and compares against configurable thresholds.

item:
 No item is used. This check monitors all checkpoints for the VM as a single service.

inventory:
 One service is created per VM that has checkpoint data available in the agent output.
