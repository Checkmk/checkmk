description:
 This check monitors the integration services status of virtual machines running on a Microsoft Hyper-V cluster.

 The check queries a Microsoft Hyper-V cluster via an agent plug-in and reports
 the status of integration services for each virtual machine. It monitors various
 guest tools services and their states (active/inactive). The check allows for
 configurable expected states per service, with a default expectation that most
 services should be active, except for specific services like "Guest Service Interface"
 which is expected to be inactive by default.

item:
 The virtual machine (no specific item name as discovery yields a single service)

inventory:
 One service per virtual machine with guest tools is created, based on the presence
 of "guest.tools.number" in the section data.
