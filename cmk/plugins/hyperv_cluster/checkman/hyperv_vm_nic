description:
 This check monitors the network interface status of virtual machines running on a Microsoft Hyper-V cluster.

 The check queries a Microsoft Hyper-V cluster via an agent plug-in and reports
 the status of each network interface. It monitors various attributes such as
 connection state, virtual switch assignment, VLAN configuration, and MAC address settings.
 
 Each network interface is uniquely identified by combining the NIC name with its
 GUID from the nic.id field (e.g., "Network Adapter (8A19AF30-D015-443F-BFCC-214C70A9A242)").
 This ensures stable service identification across VM configurations and prevents
 conflicts when multiple NICs have the same name.

item:
 The network interface name combined with its unique GUID identifier as discovered
 by the agent. Format: "NIC Name (GUID)", for example "Network Adapter (9A19BF50-DFFF-443F-AAAA-214C70A9A111)".

inventory:
 One service per network interface is created, based on the presence of "nic.name" in the section data.
