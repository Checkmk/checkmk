description:
 This check shows the CPU usage of the pods of a Kubernetes Resource Quota, its
 requests utilization and its limits utilization.

 Requests utilization is the CPU usage divided by the configured hard spec CPU request value.
 Limit utilization is computed in the same manner with the respective hard spec CPU limit value.
 The utilization percentage values are omitted if any of the associated request/limit value are not
 configured for the Resource Quota.

 The service includes metrics for the CPU usage, the requests utilization, the limits utilization,
 the CPU requests and CPU limits of the Kubernetes object.

 There are no default thresholds for this service. However, thresholds can be configured via the
 "Kubernetes resource quota CPU resource utilization" ruleset.

 The check requires that the special agent kube is configured.

discovery:
 One service is created per Kubernetes Resource Quota.
