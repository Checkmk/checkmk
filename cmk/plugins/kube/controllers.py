    Kubernetes only provides the information which controller is directly
    controlling the Pod. For instance, if we have a ControlChain of the form
    DataBase > Deployment > ReplicaSet > Pod, then the Pod only knows about the
    ReplicaSet. In order to obtain the whole chain, we need the API data of the
    ReplicaSet and the Deployment, since each of them know about their
    controller, and thus give us one piece of the ControlChain. This why this
    function is combining data from muliple different queries to the API
    Server, aka object_to_owners.
    Note, that since DataBase is a CustomResourceDefinition Checkmk does not
    collect any API data on this resource. Therefore, we can't lookup any
    OwnerReferences of DataBase. Thus, the ControlChain ends.
