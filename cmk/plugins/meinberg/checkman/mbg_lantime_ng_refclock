description:

 This check monitors the refclock state of Meinberg LANTIME clocks supporting
 the new MBG-LANTIME-NG-MIB. It is only applied to non-gps (i.e. radio
 frequency) refclocks, since the gps refclocks have their own subcheck.

 The check handles the reported state of the refclock and provides additional information
 about its state, like the field strength and the corellation.

 When the refclock state is "not available" CRIT is raised and a WARN state is issued
 if the refclock state is "not synchronized".

discovery:
 One service is created for each non-gps refclock.

item:
 The index number of the refclock.
