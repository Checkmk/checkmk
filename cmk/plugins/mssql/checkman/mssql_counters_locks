 This check monitors locking related information of MSSQL tablespaces
 like for example the number of deadlocks per second or lock requests.

 The check has been developed with MSSQL Server 2008 R2 but should
 work with other versions too.

 This check needs the Checkmk mssql.vbs plugin installed in
 the agent. Please refer to the online documentation
 for how to install that plugin.
