title: MSSQL Server: Page Life Expectancy (PLE)
agents: windows
catalog: app/mssql
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the page life expectancy on MSSQL Server. It is possible
 to configure lower thresholds for PLE using the ruleset "MSSQL Page Life
 Expectancy". By default, the check returns a WARN state if the PLE falls below
 350 seconds, and a CRIT state if it falls below 300 seconds.

 The prerequisite for this check is that the mssql.vbs agent plugin is
 installed on the host. Please refer to the online documentation for
 installation instructions.

item:
 The MSSQL object and instance name (as defined in the view
 "sys.dm_os_performance_counters"), separated by a space. If no instance name
 is defined by MSSQL, the object name is used on its own.

discovery:
 One service is created for each available PLE counter.
