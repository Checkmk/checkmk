agents: linux

distribution: check_mk
description:
  This check monitors the total CPU utilization in percent of a Podman container.

  The check creates a metric that is measured against configurable levels. Note that not all
  configuration options of the corresponding ruleset will have an effect on this check. In
  particular, any option related to individual CPU cores will have no effect, since no single-core
  data is available from the container.

  The check utilizes the `CPU` field reported by the Podman API.

discovery: One service is created.
