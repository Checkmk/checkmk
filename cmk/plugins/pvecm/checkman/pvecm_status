 Promox Virtual Environment cluster setup. To make
 this check work 'pvecm' command and the linux agent

 The check will be CRIT in the following three cases:

 - the cman tool cannot open connection,

 - the expected votes are not equal the total votes,

 - quorum says 'activity blocked'.

 Otherwise the check reports OK.
