title: HDD Health Statistics Using S.M.A.R.T Via ATA
agents: linux

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors health statistics of hard disk drives using the
 information reported by S.M.A.R.T.

 During discovery the current value of the following counters is stored as a
 service parameter.

 - Reallocated sectors

 - Spin retries

 - End-To-End errors

 - Command Timeout Counter

 - Reallocated events

 - Pending sectors

 - (UDMA) CRC errors

 If any of these counters increase, the check goes {CRIT}.
 It will become {OK} again if the service is rediscovered.
 This behaviour is configurable via the rule SMART ATA.
 Additionally, the check compares the reallocated events to the corresponding
 thresholds reported via smartctl.

 The check requires enabling agent plugin {smart_posix}.
 Moreover, the monitored device needs support the ATA protocol.

item:
 Block device name, e.g., /dev/da0

discovery:
 One service is created if the device uses the ATA protocol.
