title: HDD Health Statistics Using S.M.A.R.T Via ATA
agents: linux

description:
 This check monitors health statistics of hard disk drives using the
 information reported by S.M.A.R.T.

 During discovery the current value of the following counters is stored as a
 service parameter.

 - Reallocated sectors

 - Spin retries

 - End-To-End errors

 - Command Timeout Counter

 - Reallocated events

 - Pending sectors

 - (UDMA) CRC errors

 If any of these counters increase, the check goes {CRIT}.
 It will become {OK} again if the service is rediscovered.
 Additionally, the check compares the reallocated events to the corresponding
 tresholds reported via smartctl.

 The check requires enabling agent plugin {smart_posix}.
 Moreover, the monitored device needs support the ATA protocol.

item:
 Block device name, e.g., /dev/da0

discovery:
 One service is created if the device uses the ATA protocol.
