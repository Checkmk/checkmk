title: HDD Health Statistics Using S.M.A.R.T Via NMVe
agents: linux

description:
 This check monitors health statistics of hard disk drives using the
 information reported by S.M.A.R.T. This check requires that the monitored
 device supports NMVe.

 During discovery the current value of the following counters is stored as a
 service parameter.

 - Media and data integrity errors

 - Critical warning

 If any of these counters increase, the check goes {CRIT}.
 It will become {OK} again if the service is rediscovered.
 Additionally, the check compares the available spare to the corresponding
 thresholds reported via smartctl.
 This behavior is configurable via the rule `SMART NMVe`.

 The check requires enabling agent plugin {smart_posix}.
 Moreover, the monitored device needs support the NMVe protocol.

item:
 Block device name, e.g., /dev/nvme0

discovery:
 One service is created if the device uses the NMVe protocol.
