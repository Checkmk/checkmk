description:
 This check measures the number of written and read bytes and the latency for each datastore on an ESX host system.
 It is important to note that ESX host systems do not always report valid data for the metrics mentioned above.
 Metrics with currently invalid data are omitted until the ESX host system starts to report valid data.
 If there is no valid data for any metric, the service will go stale.

 You can configure levels for the read, write and latency values.

item:
 Name of the instance if available, otherwise the UUID.

discovery:
 The discovery can be configured via the ruleset "Disk IO discovery".
 Either one summary service or one service for each datastore is created.
