description:
 This check measures the number of written and read bytes and the latency for each datastore on an ESX host system.
 It is important to note that the devices sometimes report a value of **-1** for the read or write bytes, which indicates that the value is not available.
 Because of this;
  - The displayed metrics may be based on fewer than 3 values when some values are missing from the collection interval (e.g. [123, -1, 3])
  - Metrics may not be displayed at all if no values are available for the specified time interval (e.g. [-1, -1, -1])
  - If no metrics are available whatsoever, the check will go stale

 You can configure levels for the read, write and latency values.

item:
 Name of the instance if available, otherwise the UUID.

discovery:
 The discovery can be configured via the ruleset "Disk IO discovery".
 Either one summary service or one service for each datastore is created.
