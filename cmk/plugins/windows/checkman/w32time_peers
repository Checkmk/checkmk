title: Windows: Time service (w32time) peer status
agents: windows

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the configured time synchronization peers in the Windows
 time service (w32time), by parsing the output of w32tm.

 Normally, the check reports the last synchronization time with each peer. Note
 that the output of w32tm is localized, so the format of the timestamp displayed
 here will depend on the locale of the Windows service account running the
 Checkmk agent.

 A ruleset, "Windows time service peers" exists where alerting can be configured
 in multiple ways, e.g., reporting on when a peer's stratum changes, when the
 last several consecutive attempts to communicate with the peer have failed, or
 when some number of attempts out of the last (not necessarily consecutive)
 tries to contact the server have failed. See the help text in the ruleset for
 more information.

 We also recommend using an Enforced Service with this check plugin, when you
 expect a particular NTP peer to be configured on the host(s).

discovery:
 One service is created for each configured w32time peer on the monitored host.
