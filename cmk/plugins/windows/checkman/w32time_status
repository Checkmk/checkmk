description:
 This check monitors and provides insight into the Windows Time Service,
 also known as "w32time". In particular, information about the current
 synchronization status is provided, including the offset established
 during the last sync, time of last successful sync, stratum, root delay,
 root dispersion, and source.

 The output is obtained from the "w32time" command directly, as Windows provides
 no public API for obtaining this information.

 Alerting parameters can be set using the ruleset "Windows time service status".

discovery:
 One service is created, assuming that the Windows time service is enabled and
 active on the monitored host.
