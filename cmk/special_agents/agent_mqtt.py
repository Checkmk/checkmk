"""
Special agent for monitoring statistics of MQTT brokers with Checkmk

Useful information:

https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.org/wiki/SYS-Topics

There is also this article that you might want to have a look at:

https://www.hivemq.com/blog/why-you-shouldnt-use-sys-topics-for-monitoring

That's all well and good, but the information available really seems to fit our needs, so we use
this interface anyway.

The most important take away is: In multi-tentant, enterprise level cluster this agent may not be
useful or probably only when directly connecting to single nodes - not sure about the later.
