        """Set the Htpasswd has of an automation user to its secret

        When changing a automation secret in the UI we also change it in the htpasswd file.
        This value was previously never used since we currently still store the secret in plain
        text and that value was used for verification.

        Now we want to be able to disable automation users so we need to prepend the password hash
        with a `!`. To be consistent we now check both the htpasswd hash and the automation secret.
        In this step we set the hash to the secret that was used previously and log if the hash was
        outdated. So hopefully all users now keep them in sync (if they have custom scripts) until
        we can finally get rid of the plain text secret.
