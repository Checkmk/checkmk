"""This module implements password hashing and validation of password hashes.

At the moment it wraps the respective functionality from passlib, with the goal of replacing
passlib in the future.

The password hashing functions return hashes in the Modular Crypto Format
(https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modular_crypt_format.html#modular-crypt-format).
The format contains an identifier for the hash algorithm that was used, the number of rounds,
a salt, and the actual checksum -- which is all the information needed to verify the hash with a
given password (see `verify`).
