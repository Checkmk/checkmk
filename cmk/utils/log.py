# NOTE: VERBOSE is a bit confusing and suffers from the not-invented-here
# syndrome. If we really insist on 3 verbosity levels (normal, verbose, very
# verbose), we should probably do the following:
#
#    * Nuke VERBOSE.
#    * Introduce NOTICE (25).
#    * Make NOTICE the default level.
#    * Optionally introduce EMERGENCY (70) and ALERT (60) for consistency.
#
# This would make our whole logging story much more consistent internally
# (code) and externally (GUI always offers the same levels). Nevertheless, we
# should keep in mind that the Python documentation strongly discourages
# introducing new log levels, at least for libraries. OTOH, with 3 verbosity
# levels, this would force us to log normal stuff with a WARNING level, which
# looks wrong.

# We need an additional log level between INFO and DEBUG to reflect the
# verbose() and vverbose() mechanisms of Check_MK.
