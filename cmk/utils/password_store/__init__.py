"""This module is meant to be used by components (e.g. active checks, notifications, bakelets)
that support getting credentials from the Check_MK password store.

The password stores primary use is to centralize stored credentials. Instead of spreading the
credentials in the whole configuration, we have this as a central place for sensitive information.

The password store mechanic provides a mechanism for keeping passwords out of the cmdline of a
process, e.g. an active check plugin. It has been built to extend existing plugins with as small
modificiations as possible. It is built out of two parts:

a) Adding arguments for the command line. This job is done for active checks plugins by
   `cmk.base.core_config._prepare_check_command` and `cmk.base.check_api.passwordstore_get_cmdline`.

b) Extracting arguments from the command line. This is done by `password_store.replace_passwords`
   for python plugins and for C monitoring plugins by the patches which can be found at
   `omd/packages/monitoring-plugins/patches/0003-cmk-password-store.dif`.

   The most interesting part is, that the password store arguments are replaced before the existing
   argument handling of the active check plugins is executed. This way we don't have to deal with
   the individual mechanics of the active check plugins. We can hook into the entry point of the
   plugin, do our work and leave the rest to the plugin.

Python active check plugins need to do something like this before the argv are processed.

  import cmk.utils.password_store
  cmk.utils.password_store.replace_passwords()

  (... use regular argv processing ...)

For cases where the password ID is not received from the command line, for example a configuration
file, there is the `extract` function which can be used like this:

  import cmk.utils.password_store
  password = cmk.utils.password_store.extract("pw_id")
