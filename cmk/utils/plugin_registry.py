# TODO: Refactor all plugins to one way of telling the registry it's name.
#       for example let all use a static/class method .name().
#       We could standardize this by making all plugin classes inherit
#       from a plugin base class instead of "object".


class Registry(Mapping[str, _VT]):
    """An abstract registry that stores objects of a given class.

    To create a registry inherit from ``Registry[A]`` where ``A`` is the class
    of the objects that are stored in the registry. Although it is not
    recommended classes can be stored inside registries as well. To create a
    class registry you have to derive from ``Registry[Type[A]]``.

    Objects can be added or removed with the register and unregister methods.

    Objects can be retrieved from the registry with a dictionary like syntax.

    Examples:

        >>> from cmk.utils.plugin_registry import Registry
        >>> class A:
        ...     def __init__(self, name: str):
        ...         self.name = name
        >>> class MyRegistry(Registry[A]):
        ...     def plugin_name(self, instance: A) -> str:
        ...         return instance.name
        >>> my_registry = MyRegistry()
        >>> my_a = A('my_a')
        >>> _ = my_registry.register(my_a)
        >>> assert my_registry['my_a'] == my_a
