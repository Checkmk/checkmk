# Install the Agent
To install the agent, simply copy it to a location where it can be executed.
With inetd, this should be something in the basic system search path like /usr/bin.
cp /tmp/check_mk_agent.aix /usr/bin/check_mk_agent

# Agent Config
Inside the Agent you'll find two config settings, which need to be changed from the 
defaults to a value that is OK on your system.
Edit /usr/bin/check_mk_agent and change
export MK_LIBDIR="/to/be/changed"
export MK_CONFDIR="/to/be/changed"

for example to these paths.
export MK_CONFDIR="/etc/check_mk"
export MK_LIBDIR="/usr/lib/check_mk_agent"
MK_CONFDIR can hold configuration files and MK_LIBDIR is used for the plugins.

Then create the directories accordingly:
mkdir /etc/check_mk /usr/lib/check_mk_agent /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins

# INETD SETUP
In most setups, the agent is called via inetd. To setup inetd for check_mk on AIX,
start by adding the TCP service name to /etc/services:
edit it and add the following entry:
check_mk        6556/tcp    # Checkmk monitoring agent


# Access security
Besides SSH which works anywhere, on AIX you have the choices of using inetd with or 
without TCPWrappers. TCPWrappers are not available on AIX by default.
In the following you find instructions for setting up with and without TCPWrappers.
Note - in our testing, tcpwrappers only delivered correct example every 2nd call, so
it's not recommended to use.
The third way is the AIX internal firewall, which is called 'genfilt'.

Inetd is configured with the file /etc/inetd.conf. Add the service to it with correct path.
#        WITHOUT TCPWRAPPERS
check_mk        stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/bin/check_mk_agent


Then enable the service using:
# Restart inetd
refresh -s inetd

Alternatively, 
#        WITH TCPWRAPPERS
edit /etc/inetd.conf to point to the tcpd daemon.
check_mk        stream  tcp     nowait  root    /path/to/tcpd /usr/bin/check_mk_agent


and add an allow entry in /etc/hosts.allow that restricts the agent access.
check_mk: nagioshost, ip_of_nagios_host, 127.0.0.1

# Restart inetd
refresh -s inetd







# Extra FEATURES
If you wish to have more stats from the server, there are 3 ways.
Sort order is by ease of configuration:

a)
enable SNMP and install the correct bundles for host stats
This will probably just work[tm] so this is what we recommend you to try first.
AIX can do SNMPv3 since 5.2 so you can secure the access if needed. See:
http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/aix/v6r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.aix.commadmn%2Fdoc%2Fcommadmndita%2Fsnmpv3_intro.htm


b)
you need to get a hold of the utilities for perfstat from 
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/wikis/display/WikiPtype/ryo
Do not use the binaries since they do an eternal loop. Instead download 
adapt.c, cpu.c, memory.c and net.c and remove the loops. 

This code seems to be not GPLed, so we cannot include it. In fact it seems to have no
license at all.


c) compile install libstatgrab
Compiling libstatgrab should be OK on 5.3, on 6.x we ran into bigger issues.
There was some changes in AIX6.1 to make it easier to code for and libstatgrab 
still has an definition to do complex stuff, if the OS is AIX.
