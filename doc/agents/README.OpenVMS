OpenVMS Agent for Check_MK
--------------------------

*** current status:  BETA ***

1. Prerequisites
    - An OpenVMS account with enhanced privileges:
      CMKRNL must be enabled per default (for network counters)
    - Make sure that you do not use the SYSTEM account! Rather create a new
      account with the name 'check_mk' with enabled privileges (TMPMBX, NETMBX, CMKRNL)
    - It is a good idea to create the login directory for the
      user who invokes the agent outside of the system disk
      (SYS$SYSDEVICE)
    - Preferable create a subdirectory [.bin] for using this
      agent

2. Using the agent
    - Copy the file check_mk_agent.openvms to your OpenVMS system
      and rename it to check_mk_agent.com.
    - For direct testing purposes you can invoke this procedure
      from the command line (@check_mk_agent)
    - If you configure the TCPIP settings (refer to PROXY) you
      can test the agent from an 'external box' using rsh
      (rsh <IP_of_OpenVMS_host> -l <VMSuser> @[.bin]check_mk_agent)
    - Hint:
      If you are playing with rsh from an other host don't forget to
      have a look on the login directory of the VMSuser - every rsh call
      produces a logFile!

3. Information
    - As this is a quite preliminary agent the sample period is set to
      only 14 seconds (will be 60 seconds at least in a stable version)
      You can change this value for you testing purpose.
      Please keep in mind that the agent currently runs (and 'holds'
      for the specified sample period)
    - In a future version of the agent we will replace external 'calls'
      (rsh) with a tcp service as known from other existing checks
    - The agent is tested on OpenVMS Version 7.3-2 and later (currently
      only on Alpha)

4. Integration into Check_MK via RSH

    - The current version of the OpenVMS does not support communication
      via TCP port 6556 yet (will come in future). Currently you have
      to access it via rsh. First make sure that a rsh-call of the agent
      from your monitoring system is possible without password.
    - Now configure the access via "datasource_programs". The following
      example for main.mk assumes, that your OpenVMS hosts have the
      host tag "vms" and that your OpenVMS user is 'check_mk':

main.mk:

datasource_programs = [
  ( "rsh -l check_mk <IP> '@[.bin]check_mk_agent'", ['vms'], ALL_HOSTS ),
]


Now you can run Check_MK service discovery as usually and should find a couple
of new checks. Here is an example output from the VMS agent on a small
virtualized test machine:
