This directory contains a skeleton for own checks that use predicitve
levels. These types of check just monitor one single value that varies
over the time.

Install the files:

  foo.agentplugin -> /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/foo (on the target host)
  foo.check       -> (OMD-SITE)/local/share/check_mk/checks/foo
  foo.wato        -> (OMD-SITE)/local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/wato/foo.py 

Do not forget to restart your site Apache after installing or modifiying the
wato/foo.py.

Now you can do inventory (cmk -I) on the target host and will get one new
service named 'FOO'. In Setup you will have a new rule below "Parameters for Inventorized checks"
in the box "My own checks". Here you can setup no, fixed or predictive levels.

Please note that predictive levels need some backlog of RRD data in order
to work.
