# Treasures

This directory contains a collection of useful scripts, plugins and other tools
that have been built by us, e.g. during consulting or development projects. We
decided to share them with the community, as they might be useful for others as
well.

A few guidelines for this directory:

- It is meant as a place to put things that we built and that are useful, but
  that are not part of the main product. This can be scripts, plugins, or other
  tools.
- It is not meant to be a place for unfinished or untested code.
- Things that are outdated can be removed without any deprecation or further notice.
- Things in this directory are not officially supported by us. They are provided
  "as is" and without any warranty. If you have questions or need help, feel free
  to ask, but we might not be able to help you.
- If you have a useful suggestion or improvement for a treasure, feel free to
  open a pull request.
- Even if we point you to a treasure in a support request or other
  communication, we don't officially support it.
