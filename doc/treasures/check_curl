# This script checks web servers by retrieving URLs. Usually
# you would use check_http, but that has some limitations when
# working through proxies.
#
# This script uses curl for retrieving urls and works well through
# proxies. It either checks if the page can be retrieved or optionally
# if the page contains a text.
#
# Usage: check_proxy [-P PROXYUSER:PROXYPASSWORD PROXYURL] URL [ TEXT ]
#
# -P    use proxy, parameters are set in this script
# URL   http, https or ftp url
# TEXT  optional text to be searched in result page

CURL_CODES="1      Unsupported protocol. This build of curl has no support for this protocol.
2      Failed to initialize.
3      URL malformat. The syntax was not correct.
5      Couldn't  resolve  proxy.  The  given  proxy  host  could not be resolved.
6      Couldn't resolve host. The given remote host was not resolved.
7      Failed to connect to host.
8      FTP weird server reply.  The  server  sent  data  curl  couldn't parse.
9      FTP  access  denied. The server denied login or denied access to the particular resource or directory you wanted to  reach.  Most often  you  tried to change to a directory that doesn't exist on the server.
11     FTP weird PASS reply. Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to  the PASS request.
13     FTP  weird PASV reply, Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to the PASV request.
14     FTP weird 227 format.  Curl  couldn't  parse  the  227-line  the server sent.
15     FTP  can't  get host. Couldn't resolve the host IP we got in the 227-line.
17     FTP couldn't set binary.  Couldn't  change  transfer  method  to binary.
18     Partial file. Only a part of the file was transferred.
19     FTP  couldn't download/access the given file, the RETR (or similar) command failed.
21     FTP quote error. A quote command returned error from the server.
22     HTTP  page  not  retrieved.  The  requested url was not found or returned another error with the HTTP error  code  being  400  or above. This return code only appears if -f/--fail is used.

27     Out of memory. A memory allocation request failed.
28     Operation  timeout.  The  specified  time-out period was reached according to the conditions.
30     FTP PORT failed. The PORT command failed. Not  all  FTP  servers support  the  PORT  command,  try  doing  a  transfer using PASV instead!
31     FTP couldn't use REST. The REST command failed. This command  is used for resumed FTP transfers.
33     HTTP range error. The range "command" didn't work.
