# This is a check_mk_agent plugin. It reads the memory module status
# information from IPMI on FSC TX 120 systems (and maybe others) using
# ipmi-sensors and ipmi-raw commands.
#
# This plugin has been developed on FSC TX 120 but may also work on
# other FSC hardware platforms. Please tell us when you find some
# other software where this plugin outputs valid information
#
# The plugin has been tested with freeipmi 0.5.1 and 0.8.4. Other
# versions may work too but have not been used during implementation.
#
# To enable this plugin simply copy it to the plugins directory of
# check_mk_agent on your target machines. By default the directory
# is located here: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins

# Check needed binarys
