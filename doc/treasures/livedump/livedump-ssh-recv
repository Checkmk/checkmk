# Can be called from remote system via SSH, for example as restricted command
# of a specific SSH key. It reads stdin for
# a) a header (specificing if its the configuration or status info)
# b) the real data as generated by livedump
#
# When the first line contains the string "state", the following lines
# are all treated as checkresult information. If the line contains the
# string "config", the following lines are treated as nagios configuration
# definitions. All chars after the config string in the subject are used
# to identfy the sending system. This is an ident of the system to support
# multiple sending systems.
#
# Configuration is written to etc/nagios/conf.d/remote-<ident>.cfg.
# The status info is sent in nagios state result file format and
# written to tmp/nagios/checkresults directory in a temporary file
# which is then processed by nagios.
