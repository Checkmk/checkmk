The System performance object consists of counters that apply to more than one instance of a component processors on the computer. 
5
The Memory performance object  consists of counters that describe the behavior of physical and virtual memory on the computer.  Physical memory is the amount of random access memory on the computer.  Virtual memory consists of the space in physical memory and on disk.  Many of the memory counters monitor paging, which is the movement of pages of code and data between disk and physical memory.  Excessive paging, a symptom of a memory shortage, can cause delays which interfere with all system processes.
7
% Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the processor spends to execute a non-Idle thread. It is calculated by measuring the duration of the idle thread is active in the sample interval, and subtracting that time from interval duration.  (Each processor has an idle thread that consumes cycles when no other threads are ready to run). This counter is the primary indicator of processor activity, and displays the average percentage of busy time observed during the sample interval. It is calculated by monitoring the time that the service is inactive, and subtracting that value from 100%.
9
% Total DPC Time is the average percentage of time that all processors spend receiving and servicing deferred procedure calls (DPCs).  (DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than the standard interrupts). It is the sum of Processor: % DPC Time for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors.  System: % Total DPC Time is a component of System: % Total Privileged Time because DPCs are executed in privileged mode.  DPCs are counted separately and are not a component of the interrupt count.  This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time.
11
File Read Operations/sec is the combined rate of file system read requests to all devices on the computer, including requests to read from the file system cache.  It is measured in numbers of reads.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.  
13
File Write Operations/sec is the combined rate of the file system write requests to all devices on the computer, including requests to write to data in the file system cache.  It is measured in numbers of writes. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
15
File Control Operations/sec is the combined rate of file system operations that are neither reads nor writes, such as file system control requests and requests for information about device characteristics or status.  This is the inverse of System: File Data Operations/sec and is measured in number of operations perf second.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
17
File Read Bytes/sec is the overall rate at which bytes are read to satisfy  file system read requests to all devices on the computer, including reads from the file system cache.  It is measured in number of bytes per second.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.  
19
File Write Bytes/sec is the overall rate at which bytes are written to satisfy file system write requests to all devices on the computer, including writes to the file system cache.  It is measured in number of bytes per second.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.  
21
File Control Bytes/sec is the overall rate at which bytes are transferred for all file system operations that are neither reads nor writes, including file system control requests and requests for information about device characteristics or status.  It is measured in numbers of bytes.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
23
% Total Interrupt Time is the average percentage of time that all processors spend receiving and servicing hardware interrupts during sample intervals, where the value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts. It is the sum of Processor: % Interrupt Time for of all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors.  DPCs are counted separately and are not a component of the interrupt count.  This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as the system timer, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines, network interface cards and other peripheral devices. 
25
Available Bytes is the amount of physical memory, in bytes, available to processes running on the computer.  It is calculated by adding the amount of space on the Zeroed, Free, and Standby memory lists. Free memory is ready for use; Zeroed memory consists of pages of memory filled with zeros to prevent subsequent processes from seeing data used by a previous process; Standby memory is memory that has been removed from a process' working set (its physical memory) on route to disk, but is still available to be recalled.  This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average. 
27
Committed Bytes is the amount of committed virtual memory, in bytes. Committed memory is the physical memory which has space reserved on the disk paging file(s). There can be one or more paging files on each physical drive. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
29
Page Faults/sec is the average number of pages faulted per second. It is measured in number of pages faulted per second because only one page is faulted in each fault operation, hence this is also equal to the number of page fault operations. This counter includes both hard faults (those that require disk access) and soft faults (where the faulted page is found elsewhere in physical memory.) Most processors can handle large numbers of soft faults without significant consequence. However, hard faults, which require disk access, can cause significant delays.
31
Commit Limit is the amount of virtual memory that can be committed without having to extend the paging file(s).  It is measured in bytes. Committed memory is the physical memory which has space reserved on the disk paging files. There can be one paging file on each logical drive). If the paging file(s) are be expanded, this limit increases accordingly.  This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
33
Write Copies/sec is the rate at which page faults are caused by attempts to write that have been satisfied by coping of the page from elsewhere in physical memory. This is an economical way of sharing data since pages are only copied when they are written to; otherwise, the page is shared. This counter shows the number of copies, without regard for the number of pages copied in each operation.
35
Transition Faults/sec is the rate at which page faults are resolved by recovering pages that were being used by another process sharing the page, or were on the modified page list or the standby list, or were being written to disk at the time of the page fault. The pages were recovered without additional disk activity. Transition faults are counted in numbers of faults; because only one page is faulted in each operation, it is also equal to the number of pages faulted.
37
Cache Faults/sec is the rate at which faults occur when a page sought in the file system cache is not found and must be retrieved from elsewhere in memory (a soft fault) or from disk (a hard fault). The file system cache is an area of physical memory that stores recently used pages of data for applications. Cache activity is a reliable indicator of most application I/O operations. This counter shows the number of faults, without regard for the number of pages faulted in each operation.
39
Demand Zero Faults/sec is the rate at which a zeroed page is required to satisfy the fault.  Zeroed pages, pages emptied of previously stored data and filled with zeros, are a security feature of Windows that prevent processes from seeing data stored by earlier processes that used the memory space. Windows maintains a list of zeroed pages to accelerate this process. This counter shows the number of faults, without regard to the number of pages retrieved to satisfy the fault. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
41
Pages/sec is the rate at which pages are read from or written to disk to resolve hard page faults. This counter is a primary indicator of the kinds of faults that cause system-wide delays.  It is the sum of Memory\\Pages Input/sec and Memory\\Pages Output/sec.  It is counted in numbers of pages, so it can be compared to other counts of pages, such as Memory\\Page Faults/sec, without conversion. It includes pages retrieved to satisfy faults in the file system cache (usually requested by applications) non-cached mapped memory files.
43
Page Reads/sec is the rate at which the disk was read to resolve hard page faults. It shows the number of reads operations, without regard to the number of pages retrieved in each operation. Hard page faults occur when a process references a page in virtual memory that is not in working set or elsewhere in physical memory, and must be retrieved from disk. This counter is a primary indicator of the kinds of faults that cause system-wide delays. It includes read operations to satisfy faults in the file system cache (usually requested by applications) and in non-cached mapped memory files. Compare the value of Memory\\Pages Reads/sec to the value of Memory\\Pages Input/sec to determine the average number of pages read during each operation.
45
Processor Queue Length is the number of threads in the processor queue.  Unlike the disk counters, this counter counters, this counter shows ready threads only, not threads that are running.  There is a single queue for processor time even on computers with multiple processors. Therefore, if a computer has multiple processors, you need to divide this value by the number of processors servicing the workload. A sustained processor queue of less than 10 threads per processor is normally acceptable, dependent of the workload.
47
Thread State is the current state of the thread.  It is 0 for Initialized, 1 for Ready, 2 for Running, 3 for Standby, 4 for Terminated, 5 for Wait, 6 for Transition, 7 for Unknown.  A Running thread is using a processor; a Standby thread is about to use one.  A Ready thread wants to use a processor, but is waiting for a processor because none are free.  A thread in Transition is waiting for a resource in order to execute, such as waiting for its execution stack to be paged in from disk.  A Waiting thread has no use for the processor because it is waiting for a peripheral operation to complete or a resource to become free.
49
Pages Output/sec is the rate at which pages are written to disk to free up space in physical memory. Pages are written back to disk only if they are changed in physical memory, so they are likely to hold data, not code. A high rate of pages output might indicate a memory shortage. Windows writes more pages back to disk to free up space when physical memory is in short supply.  This counter shows the number of pages, and can be compared to other counts of pages, without conversion.
51
Page Writes/sec is the rate at which pages are written to disk to free up space in physical memory. Pages are written to disk only if they are changed while in physical memory, so they are likely to hold data, not code.  This counter shows write operations, without regard to the number of pages written in each operation.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
53
The Browser performance object consists of counters that measure the rates of announcements, enumerations, and other Browser transmissions.
55
Announcements Server/sec is the rate at which the servers in this domain have announced themselves to this server.
57
Pool Paged Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the paged pool, an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that can be written to disk when they are not being used.  Memory\\Pool Paged Bytes is calculated differently than Process\\Pool Paged Bytes, so it might not equal Process\\Pool Paged Bytes\\_Total. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
59
Pool Nonpaged Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the nonpaged pool, an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that cannot be written to disk, but must remain in physical memory as long as they are allocated.  Memory\\Pool Nonpaged Bytes is calculated differently than Process\\Pool Nonpaged Bytes, so it might not equal Process\\Pool Nonpaged Bytes\\_Total.  This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
61
Pool Paged Allocs is the number of calls to allocate space in the paged pool. The paged pool is an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that can be written to disk when they are not being used. It is measured in numbers of calls to allocate space, regardless of the amount of space allocated in each call.  This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
63
Pool Paged Resident Bytes is the current size, in bytes, of the paged pool. The paged pool is an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that can be written to disk when they are not being used. Space used by the paged and nonpaged pools are taken from physical memory, so a pool that is too large denies memory space to processes. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
65
Pool Nonpaged Allocs is the number of calls to allocate space in the nonpaged pool. The nonpaged pool is an area of system memory area for objects that cannot be written to disk, and must remain in physical memory as long as they are allocated.  It is measured in numbers of calls to allocate space, regardless of the amount of space allocated in each call.  This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
67
Bytes Total/sec is the total rate of bytes sent to or received from the network by the protocol, but only for the frames (packets) which carry data. This is the sum of Frame Bytes/sec and Datagram Bytes/sec.
69
System Code Total Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the pageable operating system code currently in virtual memory. It is a measure of the amount of physical memory being used by the operating system that can be written to disk when not in use. This value is calculated by summing the bytes in Ntoskrnl.exe, Hal.dll, the boot drivers, and file systems loaded by Ntldr/osloader.  This counter does not include code that must remain in physical memory and cannot be written to disk. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
71
System Code Resident Bytes is the size, in bytes of the operating system code currently in physical memory that can be written to disk when not in use. This value is a component of Memory\\System Code Total Bytes, which also includes operating system code on disk. Memory\\System Code Resident Bytes (and Memory\\System Code Total Bytes) does not include code that must remain in physical memory and cannot be written to disk. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
73
System Driver Total Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the pageable virtual memory currently being used by device drivers. Pageable memory can be written to disk when it is not being used. It includes physical memory (Memory\\System Driver Resident Bytes) and code and data paged to disk. It is a component of Memory\\System Code Total Bytes. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.  
75
System Driver Resident Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the pageable physical memory being used by device drivers. It is the working set (physical memory area) of the drivers. This value is a component of Memory\\System Driver Total Bytes, which also includes driver memory that has been written to disk. Neither Memory\\System Driver Resident Bytes nor Memory\\System Driver Total Bytes includes memory that cannot be written to disk.
77
System Cache Resident Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the pageable operating system code in the file system cache. This value includes only current physical pages and does not include any virtual memory pages not currently resident. It does equal the System Cache value shown in Task Manager. As a result, this value may be smaller than the actual amount of virtual memory in use by the file system cache. This value is a component of Memory\\System Code Resident Bytes which represents all pageable operating system code that is currently in physical memory. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average. 
79

85
Server List Requests/sec is the rate at which requests to retrieve a list of browser servers have been processed by this workstation.
87
The Cache performance object  consists of counters that monitor the file system cache, an area of physical memory that stores recently used data as long as possible to permit access to the data without having to read from the disk.  Because applications typically use the cache, the cache is monitored as an indicator of application I/O operations.  When memory is plentiful, the cache can grow, but when memory is scarce, the cache can become too small to be effective.
89
Data Maps/sec is the frequency that a file system such as NTFS, maps a page of a file into the file system cache to read the page.
91
Sync Data Maps/sec counts the frequency that a file system, such as NTFS, maps a page of a file into the file system cache to read the page, and wishes to wait for the page to be retrieved if it is not in main memory.
93
Async Data Maps/sec is the frequency that an application using a file system, such as NTFS, to map a page of a file into the file system cache to read the page, and does not wait for the page to be retrieved if it is not in main memory.
95
Data Map Hits is the percentage of data maps in the file system cache that could be resolved without having to retrieve a page from the disk, because the page was already in physical memory.
97
Data Map Pins/sec is the frequency of data maps in the file system cache that resulted in pinning a page in main memory, an action usually preparatory to writing to the file on disk.   While pinned, a page's physical address in main memory and virtual address in the file system cache will not be altered.
99
Pin Reads/sec is the frequency of reading data into the file system cache preparatory to writing the data back to disk.  Pages read in this fashion are pinned in memory at the completion of the read.  While pinned, a page's physical address in the file system cache will not be altered.
101
Sync Pin Reads/sec is the frequency of reading data into the file system cache preparatory to writing the data back to disk.  Pages read in this fashion are pinned in memory at the completion of the read.  The file system will not regain control until the page is pinned in the file system cache, in particular if the disk must be accessed to retrieve the page.  While pinned, a page's physical address in the file system cache will not be altered.
103
Async Pin Reads/sec is the frequency of reading data into the file system cache preparatory to writing the data back to disk.  Pages read in this fashion are pinned in memory at the completion of the read.  The file system will regain control immediately even if the disk must be accessed to retrieve the page.  While pinned, a page's physical address will not be altered.
105
Pin Read Hits is the percentage of pin read requests that hit the file system cache, i.e., did not require a disk read in order to provide access to the page in the file system cache.  While pinned, a page's physical address in the file system cache will not be altered.  The LAN Redirector uses this method for retrieving data from the cache, as does the LAN Server for small transfers.  This is usually the method used by the disk file systems as well.
107
Copy Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from pages of the file system cache that involve a memory copy of the data from the cache to the application's buffer.  The LAN Redirector uses this method for retrieving information from the file system cache, as does the LAN Server for small transfers.  This is a method used by the disk file systems as well.
109

113
Copy Read Hits is the percentage of cache copy read requests that hit the cache, that is, they did not require a disk read in order to provide access to the page in the cache.  A copy read is a file read operation that is satisfied by a memory copy from a page in the cache to the application's buffer.  The LAN Redirector uses this method for retrieving information from the cache, as does the LAN Server for small transfers.  This is a method used by the disk file systems as well.
115
MDL Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that use a Memory Descriptor List (MDL) to access the data.  The MDL contains the physical address of each page involved in the transfer, and thus can employ a hardware Direct Memory Access (DMA) device to effect the copy.  The LAN Server uses this method for large transfers out of the server.
117
Sync MDL Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that use a Memory Descriptor List (MDL) to access the pages.  The MDL contains the physical address of each page in the transfer, thus permitting Direct Memory Access (DMA) of the pages.  If the accessed page(s) are not in main memory, the caller will wait for the pages to fault in from the disk.
119
Async MDL Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that use a Memory Descriptor List (MDL) to access the pages.  The MDL contains the physical address of each page in the transfer, thus permitting Direct Memory Access (DMA) of the pages.

121
MDL Read Hits is the percentage of Memory Descriptor List (MDL) Read requests to the file system cache that hit the cache, i.e., did not require disk accesses in order to provide memory access to the page(s) in the cache.
123
Read Aheads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache in which the Cache detects sequential access to a file.  The read aheads permit the data to be transferred in larger blocks than those being requested by the application, reducing the overhead per access.
125
Fast Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that bypass the installed file system and retrieve the data directly from the cache.  Normally, file I/O requests invoke the appropriate file system to retrieve data from a file, but this path permits direct retrieval of data from the cache without file system involvement if the data is in the cache.  Even if the data is not in the cache, one invocation of the file system is avoided.
127
Sync Fast Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that bypass the installed file system and retrieve the data directly from the cache.  Normally, file I/O requests invoke the appropriate file system to retrieve data from a file, but this path permits direct retrieval of data from the cache without file system involvement if the data is in the cache.  Even if the data is not in the cache, one invocation of the file system is avoided.  If the data is not in the cache, the request (application program call) will wait until the data has been retrieved from disk.
129
Async Fast Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that bypass the installed file system and retrieve the data directly from the cache.  Normally, file I/O requests will invoke the appropriate file system to retrieve data from a file, but this path permits data to be retrieved from the cache directly (without file system involvement) if the data is in the cache.  Even if the data is not in the cache, one invocation of the file system is avoided.  If the data is not in the cache, the request (application program call) will not wait until the data has been retrieved from disk, but will get control immediately.
131
Fast Read Resource Misses/sec is the frequency of cache misses necessitated by the lack of available resources to satisfy the request.
133
Fast Read Not Possibles/sec is the frequency of attempts by an Application Program Interface (API) function call to bypass the file system to get to data in the file system cache that could not be honored without invoking the file system.
135
Lazy Write Flushes/sec is the rate at which the Lazy Writer thread has written to disk.  Lazy Writing is the process of updating the disk after the page has been changed in memory, so that the application that changed the file does not have to wait for the disk write to be complete before proceeding.  More than one page can be transferred by each write operation.
137
Lazy Write Pages/sec is the rate at which the Lazy Writer thread has written to disk.  Lazy Writing is the process of updating the disk after the page has been changed in memory, so that the application that changed the file does not have to wait for the disk write to be complete before proceeding.  More than one page can be transferred on a single disk write operation.
139
Data Flushes/sec is the rate at which the file system cache has flushed its contents to disk as the result of a request to flush or to satisfy a write-through file write request.  More than one page can be transferred on each flush operation.

143
% User Time is the percentage of elapsed time the processor spends in the user mode. User mode is a restricted processing mode designed for applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems.  The alternative, privileged mode, is designed for operating system components and allows direct access to hardware and all memory.  The operating system switches application threads to privileged mode to access operating system services. This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time.
145
% Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code in privileged mode.  When a Windows system service in called, the service will often run in privileged mode to gain access to system-private data. Such data is protected from access by threads executing in user mode. Calls to the system can be explicit or implicit, such as page faults or interrupts. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the process. 
147
Context Switches/sec is the combined rate at which all processors on the computer are switched from one thread to another.  Context switches occur when a running thread voluntarily relinquishes the processor, is preempted by a higher priority ready thread, or switches between user-mode and privileged (kernel) mode to use an Executive or subsystem service.  It is the sum of Thread\\Context Switches/sec for all threads running on all processors in the computer and is measured in numbers of switches.  There are context switch counters on the System and Thread objects. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
149
Interrupts/sec is the average rate, in incidents per second, at which the processor received and serviced hardware interrupts. It does not include deferred procedure calls (DPCs), which are counted separately. This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as the system clock, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines, network interface cards, and other peripheral devices. These devices normally interrupt the processor when they have completed a task or require attention. Normal thread execution is suspended. The system clock typically interrupts the processor every 10 milliseconds, creating a background of interrupt activity. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
151
System Calls/sec is the combined rate of calls to operating system service routines by all processes running on the computer. These routines perform all of the basic scheduling and synchronization of activities on the computer, and provide access to non-graphic devices, memory management, and name space management. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
153
Level 1 TLB Fills/sec is the frequency of faults that occur when reference is made to memory whose Page Table Entry (PTE) is not in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB).  On some computers this fault is handled by software loading the PTE into the TLB, and this counter is incremented.
155
Level 2 TLB Fills/sec is the frequency of faults that occur when reference is made to memory whose Page Table Entry (PTE) is not in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), nor is the page containing the PTE.  On some computers this fault is handled by software loading the PTE into the TLB, and this counter is incremented.
157
% User Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code in user mode. Applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems execute in user mode. Code executing in user mode cannot damage the integrity of the Windows executive, kernel, and device drivers. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the process.
159
% Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code in privileged mode. When a Windows system service is called, the service will often run in privileged mode to gain access to system-private data. Such data is protected from access by threads executing in user mode. Calls to the system can be explicit or implicit, such as page faults or interrupts. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the process.

171
Missed Server List Requests is the number of requests to retrieve a list of browser servers that were received by this workstation, but could not be processed.
173
Virtual Bytes Peak is the maximum size, in bytes, of virtual address space the process has used at any one time. Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages. However, virtual space is finite, and the process might limit its ability to load libraries.
175
Virtual Bytes is the current size, in bytes, of the virtual address space the process is using. Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages. Virtual space is finite, and the process can limit its ability to load libraries.
177
Page Faults/sec is the rate at which page faults by the threads executing in this process are occurring.  A page fault occurs when a thread refers to a virtual memory page that is not in its working set in main memory. This may not cause the page to be fetched from disk if it is on the standby list and hence already in main memory, or if it is in use by another process with whom the page is shared.
179
Working Set Peak is the maximum size, in bytes, of the Working Set of this process at any point in time. The Working Set is the set of memory pages touched recently by the threads in the process. If free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are left in the Working Set of a process even if they are not in use. When free memory falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets. If they are needed they will then be soft-faulted back into the Working Set before they leave main memory.
181
Working Set is the current size, in bytes, of the Working Set of this process. The Working Set is the set of memory pages touched recently by the threads in the process. If free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are left in the Working Set of a process even if they are not in use.  When free memory falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets. If they are needed they will then be soft-faulted back into the Working Set before leaving main memory.
183
Page File Bytes Peak is the maximum number of bytes this process has used in the paging file(s). Paging files are used to store pages of memory used by the process that are not contained in other files.  Paging files are shared by all processes, and the lack of space in paging files can prevent other processes from allocating memory.
185
Page File Bytes is the current number of bytes that this process has used in the paging file(s). Paging files are used to store pages of memory used by the process that are not contained in other files. Paging files are shared by all processes, and the lack of space in paging files can prevent other processes from allocating memory.

% Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that all of process threads used the processor to execution instructions. An instruction is the basic unit of execution in a computer, a thread is the object that executes instructions, and a process is the object created when a program is run. Code executed to handle some hardware interrupts and trap conditions are included in this count.

% Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that all of process threads used the processor to execution instructions. An instruction is the basic unit of execution in a computer, a thread is the object that executes instructions, and a process is the object created when a program is run. Code executed to handle some hardware interrupts and trap conditions are included in this count.
193
% User Time is the percentage of elapsed time that this thread has spent executing code in user mode.  Applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems execute in user mode.  Code executing in user mode cannot damage the integrity of the Windows NT Executive, Kernel, and device drivers.  Unlike some early operating systems, Windows NT uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes.  These subsystem processes provide additional protection.  Therefore, some work done by Windows NT on behalf of your application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in your process.
195
% Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code in privileged mode.  When a Windows system service in called, the service will often run in privileged mode to gain access to system-private data. Such data is protected from access by threads executing in user mode. Calls to the system can be explicit or implicit, such as page faults or interrupts. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the process.
197
Context Switches/sec is the rate of switches from one thread to another.  Thread switches can occur either inside of a single process or across processes.  A thread switch can be caused either by one thread asking another for information, or by a thread being preempted by another, higher priority thread becoming ready to run.  Unlike some early operating systems, Windows NT uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes.  These subsystem processes provide additional protection.  Therefore, some work done by Windows NT on behalf of an application  appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the application.  Switching to the subsystem process causes one Context Switch in the application thread.  Switching back causes another Context Switch in the subsystem thread.
199
Current Disk Queue Length is the number of requests outstanding on the disk at the time the performance data is collected. It also includes requests in service at the time of the collection. This is a instantaneous snapshot, not an average over the time interval. Multi-spindle disk devices can have multiple requests that are active at one time, but other concurrent requests are awaiting service. This counter might reflect a transitory high or low queue length, but if there is a sustained load on the disk drive, it is likely that this will be consistently high. Requests experience delays proportional to the length of this queue minus the number of spindles on the disks. For good performance, this difference should average less than two.
201
% Disk Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the selected disk drive was busy servicing read or write requests.
203

231
The Process performance object consists of counters that monitor running application program and system processes.  All the threads in a process share the same address space and have access to the same data.
233
The Thread performance object consists of counters that measure aspects of thread behavior.  A thread is the basic object that executes instructions on a processor.  All running processes have at least one thread.
235
The Physical Disk performance object consists of counters that monitor hard or fixed disk drive on a computer.  Disks are used to store file, program, and paging data and are read to retrieve these items, and written to record changes to them.  The values of physical disk counters are sums of the values of the logical disks (or partitions) into which they are divided.
237
The Logical Disk performance object consists of counters that monitor logical partitions of a hard or fixed disk drives.  Performance Monitor identifies logical disks by their a drive letter, such as C.
239
The Processor performance object consists of counters that measure aspects of processor activity The processor is the part of the computer that performs arithmetic and logical computations, initiates operations on peripherals, and runs the threads of processes.  A computer can have multiple processors.  The processor object represents each processor as an instance of the object.
241
% Total Processor Time is the average percentage of time that all processors on the computer are executing non-idle threads.   This counter was designed as the primary indicator of processor activity on multiprocessor computers.  It is equal to the sum of Process: % Processor Time for all processors, divided by the number of processors.  It is calculated by summing the time that all processors spend executing the thread of the Idle process in each sample interval, subtracting that value from 100%, and dividing the difference by the number of processors on the computer.  (Each processor has an Idle thread which consumes cycles when no other threads are ready to run). For example, on a multiprocessor computer, a value of 50% means that all processors are busy for half of the sample interval, or that half of the processors are busy for all of the sample interval.  This counter displays the average percentage of busy time observed during the sample interval.  It is calculated by monitoring the time the service was inactive, and then subtracting that value from 100%. 
243
% Total User Time is the average percentage of non-idle time all processors spend in user mode.  It is the sum of Processor: % User Time for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors.  System: % Total User Time and System: % Total Privileged Time sum to % Total Processor Time, but not always to 100%.  (User mode is a restricted processing mode designed for applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems.  The alternative, privileged mode, is designed for operating system components and allows direct access to hardware and all memory.  The operating system switches application threads to privileged mode to access operating system services). This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time. 
245
% Total Privileged Time is the average percentage of non-idle time all processors spend in privileged (kernel) mode.  It is the sum of Processor: % Privileged Time for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors.  System: % Total User Time and System: % Total Privileged Time sum to % Total Processor Time, but not always to 100%.  (Privileged mode is an processing mode designed for operating system components which allows direct access to hardware and all memory.  The operating system switches application threads to privileged mode to access operating system services.  The alternative, user mode, is a restricted processing mode designed for applications and environment subsystems). This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time. 
247
Total Interrupts/sec is the combined rate of hardware interrupts received and serviced by all processors on the computer It is the sum of Processor: Interrupts/sec for all processors, and divided by the number of processors, and is measured in numbers of interrupts.  It does not include DPCs, which are counted separately.  This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as the system timer, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines, network interface cards and other peripheral devices.  These devices normally interrupt the processor when they have completed a task or require attention.  Normal thread execution is suspended during interrupts.  Most system clocks interrupt the processor every 10 milliseconds, creating a background of interrupt activity.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval. 
249
Processes is the number of processes in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  Each process represents the running of a program.
251
Threads is the number of threads in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  A thread is the basic executable entity that can execute instructions in a processor.
253
Events is the number of events in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  An event is used when two or more threads try to synchronize execution.
255
Semaphores is the number of semaphores in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  Threads use semaphores to obtain exclusive access to data structures that they share with other threads.
257
Mutexes counts the number of mutexes in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  Mutexes are used by threads to assure only one thread is executing a particular section of code.
259
Sections is the number of sections in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  A section is a portion of virtual memory created by a process for storing data. A process can share sections with other processes.
261
The Object performance object consists of counters that monitor  logical objects in the system, such as processes, threads, mutexes, and semaphores.  This information can be used to detect the unnecessary consumption of computer resources.  Each object requires memory to store basic information about the object.
263
The Redirector performance object consists of counter that monitor network connections originating at the local computer.
265
Bytes Received/sec is the rate of bytes coming in to the Redirector from the network.  It includes all application data as well as network protocol information (such as packet headers).
267
Packets Received/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is receiving packets (also called SMBs or Server Message Blocks).  Network transmissions are divided into packets.  The average number of bytes received in a packet can be obtained by dividing Bytes Received/sec by this counter.  Some packets received might not contain incoming data (for example an acknowledgment to a write made by the Redirector would count as an incoming packet).
269
Read Bytes Paging/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is attempting to read bytes in response to page faults.  Page faults are caused by loading of modules (such as programs and libraries), by a miss in the Cache (see Read Bytes Cache/sec), or by files directly mapped into the address space of applications (a high-performance feature of Windows NT).
271
Read Bytes Non-Paging/sec are those bytes read by the Redirector in response to normal file requests by an application when they are redirected to come from another computer.  In addition to file requests, this counter includes other methods of reading across the network such as Named Pipes and Transactions.  This counter does not count network protocol information, just application data.
273
Read Bytes Cache/sec is the rate at which applications are accessing the file system cache by using the Redirector.  Some of these data requests are satisfied by retrieving the data from the cache.  Requests that miss the Cache cause a page fault (see Read Bytes Paging/sec).
275
Read Bytes Network/sec is the rate at which applications are reading data across the network. This occurs when data sought in the file system cache is not found there and must be retrieved from the network.  Dividing this value by Bytes Received/sec indicates the proportion of application data traveling across the network. (see Bytes Received/sec).
277
Bytes Transmitted/sec is the rate at which bytes are leaving the Redirector to the network.  It includes all application data as well as network protocol information (such as packet headers and the like).
279
Packets Transmitted/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is sending packets (also called SMBs or Server Message Blocks).  Network transmissions are divided into packets.  The average number of bytes transmitted in a packet can be obtained by dividing Bytes Transmitted/sec by this counter.
281
Write Bytes Paging/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is attempting to write bytes changed in the pages being used by applications.  The program data changed by modules (such as programs and libraries) that were loaded over the network are 'paged out' when no longer needed.  Other output pages come from the file system cache (see Write Bytes Cache/sec).
283
Write Bytes Non-Paging/sec is the rate at which bytes are written by the Redirector in response to normal file outputs by an application when they are redirected to another computer.  In addition to file requests, this count includes other methods of writing across the network, such as Named Pipes and Transactions.  This counter does not count network protocol information, just application data.
285
Write Bytes Cache/sec is the rate at which applications on your computer are writing to the file system cache by using the Redirector.  The data might not leave your computer immediately; it can be retained in the cache for further modification before being written to the network.  This saves network traffic.  Each write of a byte into the cache is counted here.
287
Write Bytes Network/sec is the rate at which applications are writing data across the network. This occurs when the file system cache is bypassed, such as for Named Pipes or Transactions, or when the cache writes the bytes to disk to make room for other data.  Dividing this counter by Bytes Transmitted/sec will indicate the proportion of application data being to the network (see Transmitted Bytes/sec).
289
File Read Operations/sec is the rate at which applications are asking the Redirector for data. Each call to a file system or similar Application Program Interface (API) call counts as one operation.
291
Read Operations Random/sec counts the rate at which, on a file-by-file basis, reads are made that are not sequential.  If a read is made using a particular file handle, and then is followed by another read that is not immediately the contiguous next byte, this counter is incremented by one.
293
Read Packets/sec is the rate at which read packets are being placed on the network.  Each time a single packet is sent with a request to read data remotely, this counter is incremented by one.
295

303
Write Packets/sec is the rate at which writes are being sent to the network.  Each time a single packet is sent with a request to write remote data, this counter is incremented by one.
305
Writes Large/sec is the rate at which writes are made by applications that are over 2 times the server's negotiated buffer size.  Too many of these could place a strain on server resources.  This counter is incremented once for each write: it counts writes, not packets.
307
Write Packets Small/sec is the rate at which writes are made by applications that are less than one-fourth of the server's negotiated buffer size.  Too many of these could indicate a waste of buffers on the server.  This counter is incremented once for each write: it counts writes, not packets.
309
Reads Denied/sec is the rate at which the server is unable to accommodate requests for Raw Reads.  When a read is much larger than the server's negotiated buffer size, the Redirector requests a Raw Read which, if granted, would permit the transfer of the data without lots of protocol overhead on each packet.  To accomplish this the server must lock out other requests, so the request is denied if the server is really busy.
311
Writes Denied/sec is the rate at which the server is unable to accommodate requests for Raw Writes.  When a write is much larger than the server's negotiated buffer size, the Redirector requests a Raw Write which, if granted, would permit the transfer of the data without lots of protocol overhead on each packet.  To accomplish this the server must lock out other requests, so the request is denied if the server is really busy.
313
Network Errors/sec is the rate at which serious unexpected errors are occurring. Such errors generally indicate that the Redirector and one or more Servers are having serious communication difficulties. For example an SMB (Server Manager Block) protocol error is a Network Error. An entry is written to the System Event Log and provide details.
315

You can be disconnected by the Server if you remain inactive for too long.  Locally even if all your remote files are closed, the Redirector will keep your connections intact for (nominally) ten minutes.  Such inactive connections are called Dormant Connections.  Reconnecting is expensive in time.
319

The efficiency of this path can be determined by dividing the Bytes/sec by this counter to obtain the average number of bytes transferred per operation.
393
Current Commands counts the number of requests to the Redirector that are currently queued for service.  If this number is much larger than the number of network adapter cards installed in the computer, then the network(s) and/or the server(s) being accessed are seriously bottlenecked.

399
The NWLink NetBIOS performance object consists of counters that monitor IPX transport rates and connections. 
401
Packets/sec is the rate the Redirector is processing data packets.  One packet includes (hopefully) many bytes.  We say hopefully here because each packet has protocol overhead.  You can determine the efficiency of this path by dividing the Bytes/sec by this counter to determine the average number of bytes transferred/packet.  You can also divide this counter by Operations/sec to determine the average number of packets per operation, another measure of efficiency.
