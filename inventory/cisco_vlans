# "The VLAN(s) the port is assigned to when the
# port's vmVlanType is set to multiVlan.
# This object is not instantiated if not applicable.

# The port is always assigned to one or more VLANs
# and the object may not be set so that there are
# no vlans assigned.

# Each octet within the value of this object specifies a
# set of eight VLANs, with the first octet specifying
# VLAN id 1 through 8, the second octet specifying VLAN
# ids 9 through 16, etc.   Within each octet, the most
# significant bit represents the lowest numbered
# VLAN id, and the least significant bit represents the
# highest numbered VLAN id.  Thus, each VLAN of the
# port is represented by a single bit within the
# value of this object.  If that bit has a value of
# '1' then that VLAN is included in the set of
# VLANs; the VLAN is not included if its bit has a
# value of '0'."
