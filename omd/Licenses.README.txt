The file Licenses.ods is the source file for Licences.csv which is
packed into the Check_MK packages and available to the user under
the path /omd/versions/default/share/doc/Licenses.csv.
All license texts can be found in Licence_texts.pdf.

For generating the file License_texts.pdf as well as updating the
list of licenses, scripts can be found in the license_sources/
directory.

Please have a look at the file license_sources/README on how these
files have been created and should be updated in future.
