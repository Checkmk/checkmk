The file names for license texts need to match the pattern "<license-id>.txt" to be included in the
omd/License_texts.pdf file.
<license-id> needs to match one of the IDs listed in omd/license_sources/License_links.csv. Thus, to
add a new license text, the text file must be put here (omd/license_sources/license_texts/) and an
according entry must be put into the License_links.csv.
Also, only the text of those licenses is included in the PDF which occur at least once in the list
of licenses omd/Licenses.csv.
