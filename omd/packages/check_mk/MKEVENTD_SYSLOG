# Alias: Enable Builtin Syslog Server (UDP)
# Menu: Addons
# Description:
#  If this option is enabled then mkeventd starts a builtin syslog
#  server that receives syslog messages via UDP port 514. Local messages
#  via /dev/log are not being received, so you can keep your local
#  syslog server running as long as it does not open UDP port 514.
#  Enabling this option makes the mkeventd started via a SUID helper
#  that first opens the (priviledged) port 514 and then starting the
#  actual event daemon.
