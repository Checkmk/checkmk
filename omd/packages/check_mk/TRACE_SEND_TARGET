# Alias: Send traces to this collector
# Menu: Add-ons
# Description:
#  If sending traces is configured, they are sent to the address of the collector configured here.
#  The most basic approach is to send traces to the site's local Jaeger instance, which needs to be
#  enabled with the TRACE_RECEIVE setting To do so, configure "local_site" here. Alternatively
#  you can configure the URL of a custom OTLP endpoint here.
