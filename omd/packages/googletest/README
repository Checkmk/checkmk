Googletest doesn't provide releases anymore, it uses a "Abseil Live at Head
philosophy" nowadays. To create a tar archive for a given hash use:

( SHA=07d4a6e93d; git archive --prefix=googletest-$SHA/ --output=googletest-$SHA.tar.gz $SHA )

Note: In an attempt to improve C++20 support, the latest version at 4fe018038f
has been broken for C++20, see https://github.com/google/googletest/issues/2881.
