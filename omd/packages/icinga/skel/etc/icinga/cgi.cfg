#
# NOTE: It is a really *bad* idea to disable authorization, unless

# so will leave you wide open to kiddies messing with Icinga and
# possibly hitting you with a denial of service attack by filling up
# your drive by continuously writing to your command file!

# use the authentication functions (the default).

# DEFAULT USER
# Setting this variable will define a default user name that can

# authentication if you are not using a secure server since basic
# authentication transmits passwords in the clear.

# "3/3" for a HARD non-OK state with max_check_attempts=3)
# but also the current notification number ("(#0)" if no
