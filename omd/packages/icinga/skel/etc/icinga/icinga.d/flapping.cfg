# FLAP DETECTION OPTION
# This option determines whether or not Icinga will try
# and detect hosts and services that are "flapping".
# Flapping occurs when a host or service changes between
# states too frequently.  When Icinga detects that a
# host or service is flapping, it will temporarily suppress
# notifications for that host/service until it stops
# flapping.  Flap detection is very experimental, so read
# the HTML documentation before enabling this feature!
# Values: 1 = enable flap detection
#         0 = disable flap detection (default)

enable_flap_detection=1



# FLAP DETECTION THRESHOLDS FOR HOSTS AND SERVICES
# Read the HTML documentation on flap detection for
# an explanation of what this option does.  This option
# has no effect if flap detection is disabled.
