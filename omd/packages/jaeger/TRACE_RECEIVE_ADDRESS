# Alias: IP address to listen for traces
# Menu: Addons
# Description:
#  If receiving traces is configured, they are only received from the local host by default. In
#  distributed setups it is useful to collect all traces in the central site. To do this, you can
#  configure the IP address to listen for traces. The setting "[::]" makes the port available to all
#  IPv4 and IPv6 clients.

# Load other config options. This hook needs TRACE_RECEIVE_PORT.
if [ -f "$OMD_ROOT/etc/omd/site.conf" ]; then
    # shellcheck source=/dev/null
