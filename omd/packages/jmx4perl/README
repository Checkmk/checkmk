Java Agent for Jmx4Perl
=======================

In order to use Jmx4Perl for monitoring Java application servers a small agent
must be deployed on the target platform.  Starting with version 0.90 Jmx4Perl
does not include these agents on its own but relies on the agents from its
sister project Jolokia (www.jolokia.org).

The agent can be easily downloaded with the install 'jolokia' tool:

# Download the WAR agent and verify its GPG signature:
$ jolokia

# List the content and configuration options of this agent
$ jolokia jolokia.war

# Switch on JEE authentication within the agent
$ jolokia repack --security jolokia.war

More about this tool can be found in its man page (man jolokia)

The nagios plugin can be found at lib/nagios/plugins/check_jmx4perl. It comes
with a comprehensive documentation, too (man check_jmx4perl). Its
configuration files are located in etc/jmx4perl/, a sample nagios command
definition is included as etc/nagios/conf.d/jmx4perl_nagios.cfg and references
the configuration in etc/jmx4perl/

Two additional tools are included in an installation, too:

* jmx4perl, a command line tool for querying the Jolokia agent. Can be easily
  used in own scripts.

* j4psh, a full blown JMX shell with readline support, context sensitive tab
  completion and syntax highlighting. 

Please refer to their man pages for usage documentation.

More information about Jmx4Perl can be found at http://www.jmx4perl.org and
http://www.jolokia.org, the home of the Java agents.
