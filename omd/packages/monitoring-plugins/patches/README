0001-check-icmp-allows-pl-of-101.dif
    This patch allows to configure check_icmp in a way that a packet loss of
    100% is not CRITICAL. Consider:

    check_icmp 10.1.1.1 -t1 -w500,80% -c1000,101%

    In this case the user would expect the outcome to be WARN, if 100%
    packats are lost. An RTA is "nan" in this case. But check_icmp would
    insist to make the outcome CRITICAL. The patch fixes this.

0003-cmk-password-store.dif
    Adds support for getting passwords from the Check_MK Password Store
    instead of having them in plaintext on the command line to various
    check plugins.
