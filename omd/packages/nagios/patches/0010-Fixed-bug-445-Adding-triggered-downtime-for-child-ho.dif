+		Previously the triggered downtime always appeared before its

+		case where a manually created, triggered downtime is created with 
+		a start time earlier than the triggering downtime.
+
+		This would need to be resolved by comparing the triggered_by value
+		with the downtime ID regardless of the start time. However, this
+		should be a relatively rare case and only caused by intentional
+		scheduling by a human. This change was not implemented because it
+		would cause the downtime list to be out of time order and the
