0001:
    When loading a broker module, Nagios makes a temporary copy of the
    module file, loads that with dl_open, and deletes it afterwards.
    This shall save agains modifications caused by a user overwriting
    the module with 'cp'. This patch removes that behaviour and loads
    the module in the traditional way. This prevents problems with tmpfs
    mounted as non-root (where Nagios places the module copy).

0002:
    The file include/utils.inc.php includes config.inc.php by going up 
    one directory in the physical directory tree. This patch changes that
    behaviour in a way needed for OMD: It is including the site specific
    config file /omd/sites/###SITE###/etc/ngaios/config.inc.php. The site name
    is extracted from the script file name (supplied by Apache).

0003:
    Remove two RSS feeds (promotions) in the classic UI

0004:
    The web frontend checks the original home page for updates. The check
    may be makes sense for folks who installed nagios by themselfs, but
    not within a distribution. This patch removes the update check from
    main.php

0005:
   This patch removes a check in the configuration validation that complains
   when there are no hosts or services. That way OMD does not need a dummy
   host anymore but can start plain without any host or service. The cgi-bins,
   Thruk and Multisite do not show any problems. Nor does the Nagios core.

0006:
    This patches fixed the problem to jump back to the start page
    whenever you press F5.

0007:
   This patch rearranges the fields in the nagios struct schedule_downtime
   to be compatible again with the one livestatus is compiled with

0008:

   plus signs

0009:

0010:
  Adding triggered downtime for child hosts causes a SIGSEGV on
  restart/reload
