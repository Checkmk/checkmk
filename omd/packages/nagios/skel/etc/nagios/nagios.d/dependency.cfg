# ENABLE PREDICTIVE HOST DEPENDENCY CHECKS
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will attempt to execute
# checks of hosts when it predicts that future dependency logic test
# may be needed.  These predictive checks can help ensure that your
# host dependency logic works well.
# Values:
#  0 = Disable predictive checks
#  1 = Enable predictive checks (default)

# ENABLE PREDICTIVE SERVICE DEPENDENCY CHECKS
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will attempt to execute
# checks of service when it predicts that future dependency logic test
# may be needed.  These predictive checks can help ensure that your
# service dependency logic works well.
# Values:
#  0 = Disable predictive checks
#  1 = Enable predictive checks (default)

# SOFT STATE DEPENDENCIES
# This option determines whether or not Nagios will use soft state
# information when checking host and service dependencies. Normally
# Nagios will only use the latest hard host or service state when
# checking dependencies. If you want it to use the latest state (regardless
# of whether its a soft or hard state type), enable this option.
# Values:
#  0 = Don't use soft state dependencies (default)
#  1 = Use soft state dependencies
