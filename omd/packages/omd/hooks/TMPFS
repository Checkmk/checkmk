# Alias: Use a ramdisk for temporary files
# Menu: Basic
#  This settings decides, wether this site uses a ramdisk for
#  temporary files. Using a ramdisk reduces disk IO produced
#  during monitoring dramatically. It is highly recommended to
#  leave this option enabled. Only disable this if you really
#  need to.
