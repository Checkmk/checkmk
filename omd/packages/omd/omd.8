.SH NAME
omd \- admin interface for OMD, the Open Monitoring Distribution
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B omd
.RI [ command
.RI [ site... ]
.RI ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B OMD - the Open Monitoring Distribution
is something really new. OMD bundles existing open source software to
ease the installation procedure of Nagios and many important addons
like NagVis, PNP4Nagios, rrdtool, nagios-plugins, Check_MK,
MK Livestatus, Dokuwiki, check_nrpe and others.

.B OMD
supports:

- multiple versions of OMD installed in parallel
.br
- multiple instances of Nagios running in parallel (so called "sites")

.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBomd\fP is the administration interface for creating and maintaining
sites within OMD - the open monitoring distribution.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B omd help
Show short summary of available commands.
.TP
.B omd version [--bare, -b] [SITE]
Show the default version of your OMD installation. OMD supports
multiple versions to be installed in parallel.
The option \fB-b\fP or \fB--bare\fP reduces the output to the plain
version number (for easier parsing in scripts). If you specify the name
of a site then that site's version is being displayed instead of the
default version.
.TP
.B omd versions [--bare, -b]
Show a list of all installed versions of OMD. The option \fB-b\fP or \fB--bare\fP
makes the output leave out a hint to the default version and easier parseable by
scripts.
.TP
.B omd setversion [VERSION]
Sets the default OMD version to be used for new sites. Can be called with a target
version as optional argument or without argument to get a menu of available versions displayed.

This mainly updates the symlink \fB/omd/versions/default\fP. On debian based distributions
it calls update-alternatives to change the default versions. In this case there is a special
option \fBauto\fP available to let update-alternatives choose the default OMD version.
.TP
.B omd sites [--bare, -b]
Show a list of all sites and the version of OMD each site uses. If you specify
the option \fB-b\fP or \fB--bare\fP, then the output leaves out hints to the
versions, so it is better parseable by scripts.
.TP
.B omd create [OPTIONS] SITE
Create a new site. The name of the site must be at most 16 characters
long and consist only of letters, digits and underscores. It must not
begin with a digit.

OMD creates an operating system user and group with the name of the
site. No user or group with that name must exist prior to the site creation. Then a
directory \fB/omd/sites/\fPSITE will be created and used as the new
user's home directory.

You need root permissions for creating a new site.

After creating a new site you can do a \fBsu - \fPSITE and start
the site with \fBomd start\fP.

The following options can be used:

\fB-u UID\fP Force a specific user id for the new user

\fB-g GID\fP Force a specific group id for the group of the new user

\fB--admin-password PW\fP Set initial password for the \fBcmkadmin\fP user. If you don't
set this, the password will be generated automatically and printed after site creation.

\fB--no-init\fP Omits the population of the site's home directory and the integration into
the system Apache (/omd/apache/SITE.conf will be empty).

\fB--apache-reload\fP Issue a reaload of the apache process instead of the default restart

\fB--no-tmpfs\fP Use this to set the omd config option TMPFS to off during site creation.
This may be useful when sites are set-up where the use of temporary filesystems is not
possible. However, it is still highly recommended to use a tmpfs for the sites \fBtmp\fP
directory for best performance.

\fB-t SIZE\fP By default the tmpfs of the site is created to allocate 50% of
the available RAM at max. When providing the \fB-t\fP option together with the SIZE
given as absolute value of e.g. \fB500M\fP or percentage value like \fB10%\fP the
maximum size of the tmpfs can be changed.

.TP
.B omd init [OPTIONS] SITE
Initializes a site that has been created with \fBomd create --no-init\fP.
This includes populating the site's home directory with the default
configuration files and enabling the site (see \fBomd disable\fP). Afterwards
the site is in the same state as after an \fBomd create\fP without \fB--no-init\fP.

The following options can be used:

\fB--apache-reload\fP Issue a reaload of the apache process instead of the default restart

.TP
.B omd [-f, --force] rm [OPTIONS] SITE
Remove a site and all of its data. This includes deleting the
directory \fB/omd/sites/\fPSITE and removing the system user
and group of that site. This - of course - needs root permissions.

The following options can be used:

The option \fB--kill\fP will automatically kill all processes that
either use the temporary filesystem of the site or are running as site
user. Otherwise the unmount and the removal of the site will fail.

\fB--apache-reload\fP Issue a reaload of the apache process instead of the default restart

.TP
.B omd disable [--kill] SITE
Disable a site. First the site will be stopped, if it is running.
Then the tmpfs will be unmounted and the site will be made unknown
to the global Apache server (by emptying the file /omd/apache/SITE.conf
and restarting Apache). You cannot do any init-action like start and
stop on a disabled site. Disabled sites will be skipped during
system boot or a manual call to \fB/etc/init.d/omd\fP.

Disabling a site brings OMD into a state where the sites home directory
\fB/omd/sites/SITE\fP is not being used or referred to by any process
or program. It can safely be unmounted. This is convenient in
situations where the site is clustered and the site's home directory
shall be moved to another cluster node.

Since unmounting the tmpfs will only be possible if no process
is using it, you can specify \fB--kill\fP to automatically kill
all such processes before the unmount. This is especially useful if
omd disable is used in cluster-failover scripts.

Disabling a site needs root permissions.

.TP
.B omd enable SITE
Enables a formerly disabled site. The site is not started. This command
needs root permissions.

.TP
.B omd mv [OPTIONS] SITE NEWNAME
Rename a site. The site must be stopped. the NEWNAME must be a valid
site name as described in "omd create". Root permissions are needed.

The following options can be used:

\fB-u UID\fP Force a specific user id for the new user

\fB-g GID\fP Force a specific group id for the group of the new user

\fB--conflict=HOW\fP non-interactively resolve merge conflicts. See
section about \fBomd update\fP for details.

\fB-t SIZE\fP By default the tmpfs of the site is created to allocate 50% of
the available RAM at max. When providing the \fB-t\fP option together with the SIZE
given as absolute value of e.g. \fB500M\fP or percentage value like \fB10%\fP the
maximum size of the tmpfs can be changed.

.TP
.B omd cp [OPTIONS] SITE NEWNAME
Make a copy of a site. A new site with the name NEWSITE will be created
as an exact copy of SITE. All occurrances of SITE will be replaced by
NEWSITE in the sites configuration files.

The following options can be used:

\fB-u UID\fP Force a specific user id for the new user

\fB-g GID\fP Force a specific group id for the group of the new user

\fB--no-rrds\fP Do not copy any performance data from the past. This
includes RRD and XML files created by PNP4Nagios as well as journal
files from the RRD caching daemon. This option usually greatly speeds
up the copying.

\fB--no-logs\fP Do not copy any logfiles from the past. This
include the Nagios logfiles, which bear the historical events. While
this does speed up the copying, the new site will have no history
of past events.

The option \fB-N\fP or \fB--no-past\fP combines both \fB--no-rrds\fP and \fB--no-logs\fP.
This is very useful especially for copies that are created for testing
purposes.

\fB--conflict=HOW\fP non-interactively resolve merge conflicts. See
section about \fBomd update\fP for details.

\fB-t SIZE\fP By default the tmpfs of the site is created to allocate 50% of
the available RAM at max. When providing the \fB-t\fP option together with the SIZE
given as absolute value of e.g. \fB500M\fP or percentage value like \fB10%\fP the
maximum size of the tmpfs can be changed.

.TP
.B omd [-f, --force] [ -V VERSION ] update [ --conflict=HOW ] SITE
Update SITE to the current default version of OMD or to the version
\fBVERSION\fP, if the option \fB-V\fP is specified.  The default version is
usually the version that was installed most lately. It can be changed
with \fBomd setversion\fP.

Those configuration files of the site that were initially created
will be updated if the new version brings changes in these files. OMD tries hard to
merge your changes with changes due to the new version but might need your
help in doing so. If a merge conflict occurs, you will be asked for an
interactive resolution. Note: OMD does \fBno\fP data migration in user-created
configuration files!

The option \fB-f/--force\fP will skip asking whether the user is sure to
update. If you have more than two versions of omd installed, you should
also specify \fB-V\fP if you want to avoid user interaction.

With \fB--conflict\fP (in addition to \fB-f\fP and \fB-V\fP) you can make
the whole update process non-interactive. There are four possible arguments
to \fB--conflict\fP:

.B --conflict=keepold
Whenever your local changes cannot be merged with changes introduced by the
target version in a file , i.e. when a merge conflict occurs, then keep the current contents
and permissions of the file unchanged (this is the same as the option \fBr\fPestore
in the merge dialog or \fBk\fPeep in the dialog for conflicts in permissions and file
types).

.B --conflict=install
In case of a merge conflict install the default file of the target version and
drop your changes.

.B --conflict=abort
In case of a merge conflict abort the update. Please note that currently there is
no roll back (yet). Files already updated stay updated. The file that caused the
conflict will contain merge indicators (>>>>>> and <<<<<<). The version will not
be switched.

.B --conflict=ask
This is the default behaviour of interactive conflict resolution.

.TP
.B omd [-f, --force] start [-p, --parallel]    [SITE] [SERVICE]
Start a site, i.e. start all activated daemons and services of a site.
If you call this as root, you need to specify the site to
be started. If you do not specify a site, then all sites with AUTOSTART=on
will be started, or all sites at all, if you specify \fB-f\fP or \fB--force\fP.
If you call this as site user, no site must be specified.
The current site will be started.

If you add the name of a service, e.g. \fBnagios\fP, then only that
service is being started. If being called as root, a service can only
be specified if also a site is specified.

When you use the start operation with multiple sites, this is done sequentially
for each site and service. You can execute the operations on the different
sites in parallel by providing the option \fB-p\fP or \fB--parallel\fP. This
will slightly change the output of the command and invoke the start operation
on each site at first and then collect the results from each site after that
and block till the start operations for all sites have been completed.
.TP
.B omd stop [-p, --parallel]      [SITE] [SERVICE]
Stop a site. See \fBomd start\fP for details. This stops also sites where
AUTOSTART=off.

After a "omd stop" call for all processes of a site stopped the processes
controlled by the init scripts, OMD searches for remaining (uncontrolled) site
processes, e.g. still running background jobs or other processes and sends a
SIGTERM to each of them.

It waits up to 5 seconds for them to stop. In case the processes did not
finish in time, it terminates the OMD call with an exit code of 1.

.TP
.B omd [-f, --force] restart    [SITE] [SERVICE]
Restart site. See \fBcmd start\fP for details.
.TP
.B omd [-f, --force] reload     [SITE] [SERVICE]
Reload services of site(s). That is the same as calling all of the sites
init scripts with the option \fBreload\fP. Refer to \fBomd start\fP for
how to specify sites.
.TP
.B omd status     [SITE] [SERVICE] [-b,--bare] [--auto]
Show status of site(s). Refer to \fBomd start\fP for
how to specify sites.

If this is called for one specific site, then the exit code is as follows:
\fB0\fP if the site is running, \fB1\fP if the site is stopped and \fB2\fP
if the site is partially running (some services running, some stopped).

The option \fB-b\fP or \fB--bare\fP produces a machine-readable output
format.

If you add the option \fB--auto\fP then only the status of those sites will
be displayed, that are set to {AUTOSTART} = {on}.
.TP
.B omd config [-f, --force] [SITE] [set|show|change] [VARIABLE] [VALUE]
This command is used to view and change the configuration of a site. Each
site has a list of configuration variables. Those variables configure
how the addons of the site should work together. Optional addons can be
switched on and off. TCP portnumbers for externel access can be configured.

\fBomd config\fP [SITE] \fBshow\fP outputs the current settings of
all variables of a SITE. If you call this as root, you have to specify
which SITE to inspect. If you call \fBomd\fP as site user, you have to
leave out SITE.

\fBomd config\fP [SITE] brings you into the interactive configuration
mode where variables can be viewed, are explained and can be changed.
The site must be stopped for configuration changes.

Setting and querying variables in batch mode can be done with

\fBomd config [SITE] set VARIABLE VALUE\fP
.br
\fBomd config [SITE] show VARIABLE\fP

The option \fB--force\fP will automatically stop the site in case
it is running before the config change is done and start it afterwards
again.

In addition to \fBomd config set\fP there is this option to set multiple
variables at once:

\fBomd config [SITE] change\fP

To change configuration options, you need to provide newline separated
KEY=value pairs via stdin, for example like this:

\fBecho -e "CORE=cmc\\nAUTOSTART=on" | omd config change\fP

The site is restarted automatically once in case it's currently runnig.

.TP
.B omd [-v] diff [RELBASE] [-b, --bare]
Shows the differences of files in the current site compared to the files
delivered with the omd version used by the current site.

Without the optional RELBASE argument it lists changes in ALL files of the
site. The RELBASE argument may contain a relative path to the sites root
directory to filter the scope of the diff.
It is also possible to give a file/link as RELBASE path. In this case only the
information for this file are shown.

The command lists files which meet at least one criteria: modified content, changed
types, modified permissions, modified owner, deleted files.

If you specify the option \fB-b\fP or \fB--bare\fP, then the output leaves out things
to make the output more human readable, so it is better parseable by scripts.

This command also handles the global option \fB-v\fP or \fB--verbose\fP. It shows the
changes in detail.
.TP
.B omd umount [--kill] [SITE]
Unmounts the ramdisk filesystem (tmpfs) of the given or all sites if no SITE option given.

The ramdisk can only be unmounted when a site is stopped and no processes are currently
using it (have a directory in it as current directory are have an open file in it).
If you specify \fB--kill\fP, then omd will kill processes using the filesystem using
\fBfuser -k\fP.
.TP
.B omd [-v] backup [OPTIONS] [SITE] [-|TARBALL_PATH]
Creates a gzipped backup tarball (.tar.gz) containing the whole site. When executing
this command as root, you need to specify the name of the site, otherwise your current
site will be used.

You need to provide either a path where the tarball will be created or specify \fB-\fP
for streaming the tarball to stdout.

The following options can be used:

\fB--no-rrds\fP Do not copy any performance data from the past. This
includes RRD and XML files created by PNP4Nagios as well as journal
files from the RRD caching daemon. This option usually greatly speeds
up the copying.

\fB--no-logs\fP Do not copy any logfiles from the past. This
include the Nagios logfiles, which bear the historical events. While
this does speed up the copying, the new site will have no history
of past events.

The option \fB-N\fP or \fB--no-past\fP combines both \fB--no-rrds\fP and \fB--no-logs\fP.
This is very useful especially for copies that are created for testing
purposes.

\fB--no-compression\fP Disable gzip compression of the backup. In case the size of the
backup is not relevant and you want to reduce CPU performance during backup, you can
disable the compression. Especiall when doing a backup/restore to another system across
a LAN, this may be useful to reduce runtime of the backup.

The site needs to be stopped to be able to create the backup. During the backup the
ramdisk filesystem (tmpfs) of the site will be unmounted. It's contents are not saved
in the tarball.

The contents of the ramdisk filesystem (tmpfs) of the site will never be saved in the
the backup.

When the site is stopped, all files are backed up without any special action. In case
the site is running, the backup will send SUSPEND/RESUME commands to the rrdcached
process to temporarily suspend updates of the RRD files currently backed up. So the
rrdached will keep the new gathered performance data in the memory during the backup
of an RRD file. After the backup of a single file, it's updates are resumed. During
the whole backup you can access the RRDs as usual from the GUI.
.TP
.B omd restore [OPTIONS] [SITE] [-|TARBALL_PATH]
Restores a backup which was previously created with \fBomd backup\fP. When executed as
site user, the current site will be cleaned up and the files from the backup will be
restored within the site directory.

When executed as root, you can use the command to either create a new site while
restoring the backup or use and existing site which is then replaced with the backed
up files.

You need to provide either a path where the backup tarball is located or specify \fB-\fP
for reading the tarball from stdin.

As root user, when you specify no \fBSITE\fP the restore will be made with the original
site name. If you like to restore the site with another name, you can specify the new
name by setting the \fBSITE\fP argument.

You can either restore a backup to overwrite an existing site using the \fB--reuse\fP
option. Together with the \fB--kill\fP option, the site will be stopped and cleaned up
before applying the restore.

Additionally the following options can be used:

\fB--apache-reload\fP Issue a reaload of the apache process instead of the default restart.

\fB-u UID\fP Force a specific user id for the new user

\fB-g GID\fP Force a specific group id for the group of the new user

\fB--conflict=HOW\fP non-interactively resolve merge conflicts. See
section about \fBomd update\fP for details.

\fB-t SIZE\fP By default the tmpfs of the site is created to allocate 50% of
the available RAM at max. When providing the \fB-t\fP option together with the SIZE
given as absolute value of e.g. \fB500M\fP or percentage value like \fB10%\fP the
maximum size of the tmpfs can be changed.
.TP
.B omd cleanup
This removes all Check_MK versions that are currently not used by any site. All
installed versions are checked for the number of sites that use this version. The
versions without sites will be removed by deinstalling the RPM/DEB package of this
version.

Note: The whole version directory \fB/omd/version/[version]\fP will be removed. Even
when there are files left after deinstallation of the RPM/DEB package. OMD will cleanup
the whole directory tree.
