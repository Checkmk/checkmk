This directory contains a very efficient API to MK Livestatus 
for Python. It is directly taken from the Multisite GUI and
has the following features:

* It supports keep alive
* It returns typed values
* It support transparent multi-site access
* It supports persistent connection caching
* It supports parallelized queries (though still single-threaded)
* It supports detection of dead sites (via "status_host")

Please look at the two examples:

example_singlesite.py: Example for a single site
example_multisite.py: Example querying several sites

Both example are written to be run within an OMD instance
and need no further configuration.

If you are not using OMD, you need to modify the examples
and enter the correct path to you livestatus socket.
Or even better: give OMD a try --> omdistro.org. This will
make you live *really* easier!
