    """An HTTPAdapter that enforces hostname validation against a given hostname.

    In Checkmk we often find ourselves in situations where we want to connect to a server via
    its IP address, but the server's SSL certificate is issued for a hostname. This adapter allows
    us to enforce hostname validation against the expected hostname, even when connecting via IP.

    Example:

        #!/usr/bin/env/python3
        ...
        address = "[12600:1406:5e00:6::17ce:bc1b]"  # this how we contact the server
        cert_server_name = "example.com"  # this is the name we expect in the server's certificate
        session = requests.Session()

        session.mount(f"https://{address}", HostnameValidationAdapter(cert_server_name))

        response = session.get(f"https://{address}/some/api/endpoint")
        ...
