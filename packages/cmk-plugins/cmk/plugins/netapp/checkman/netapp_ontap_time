title: NetApp Filer: System time offset
agents: netapp
catalog: hw/storagehw/netapp
license: GPLv2
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the system time of the NetApp node. It computes the
 difference between the time measured on the monitored node and the time
 of the Checkmk server when the data is processed. The resulting difference
 is referred to as "time_offset" here (this is also the metrics name).

 Returns {WARN}/{CRIT} if the absolute system time offset is above the
 given levels.

 By default, the check uses warning level of 30 seconds and critical level
 of 60 seconds. These levels may be configured with WATO rule group
 {Netapp system time offset}.

 As the offset includes the systematic time delay between querying the host
 and querying the reference time, it is never expected to be zero.

 Please note: You need the Special Agent "NetApp via ONTAP REST Api" to
 retrieve the monitoring data from the device. The Special Agent itself can
 be configured by WATO.
