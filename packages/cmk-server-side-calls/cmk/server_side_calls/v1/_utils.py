    Address config holds the data collected from the host setup configuration.
    Resolved address can be the same as ipv4_address or ipv6_address from the address config,
    resolved from the host name or host name if dynamic DNS is configured.

    If the IP family is configured as IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack in address config,
    resolved IP family will be resolved using the `Primary IP address family of dual-stack hosts`
    rule.

    Resolved address can be None in case `No IP` has been configured as host's IP
    address family or if resolution wasn't successful.

    stability, so the above might change location and name in the future.
