  description: "# Introduction\n\nWith the Checkmk REST-API you can transfer and execute\
    \ the tasks you normally perform\nmanually in Checkmk's GUI to the Checkmk server\
    \ via command or script.\n\nREST stands for Representational State Transfer and\
    \ describes an architecture for the exchange of\ndata on distributed systems -\
    \ especially for Web services. The implementation of this REST-API is\ndone via\
    \ the HTTP/1.1 protocol, where resources are addressed via URIs and accessed with\
    \ HTTP\nmethods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n\nThe API is documented in a machine-readable\
    \ schema and a human-readable format in English, with all\nresources, their input\
    \ and output parameters and the associated value ranges. The API is created\n\
    with the OpenAPI specification 3.x, an API description format especially for REST\
    \ APIs.\n\nThe API documentation created with this specification is displayed\
    \ to you with ReDoc (a\nresponsive Web design for an OpenAPI document) or with\
    \ Swagger UI (an OpenAPI document\nvisualization for direct interaction with the\
    \ API's resources).\n\n\n# Prerequisites\n\n* You know Checkmk and its principles\
    \ of setup and configuration.\n* You are experienced in using an API, preferably\
    \ a REST-API.\n* You are familiar with at least one of the applications for which\
    \ sample code is available.\n* It helps if you have already worked with ReDoc\
    \ and/or Swagger UI.\n\n# Responses\n\nAs specified by the `Content-Type` of `application/json`,\
    \ the response payload is serialized with\nJSON and encoded in UTF-8.\n\n## JSON\
    \ envelope attributes for objects\n\nAll objects are wrapped in a JSON structure\
    \ called a \"Domain Object\" which take the following\nform:\n\n    {\n      \
    \  \"domainType\": <domain type>,\n        \"instanceId\": <string to uniquely\
    \ identify domain object>,\n        \"title\": <human readable header>,\n    \
    \    \"links\": [<relation link>, ...],\n        \"extensions\": {\n         \
    \   <attribute name>: <attribute value>,\n            ...\n        },\n      \
    \  \"members\": {\n            <member name>: <member definition>,\n         \
    \   ...\n        }\n     }\n\nThe collections `members`, `extensions` and `links`\
    \ are defined as such:\n\n * domainType - The type of object this refers to, e.g.\
    \ `host`, and `service`.\n * instanceId - The globally unique identifier for this\
    \ particular object.\n * title - A human readable string which is only relevant\
    \ for user interfaces.\n * links - A collection of links to other resources or\
    \ actions.\n * extensions - The data container for all direct attributes of the\
    \ object.\n * members - The container for external resources, like linked foreign\
    \ objects or actions.\n\n### Note\n\nPreviously, an attribute called `members`\
    \ has been used in these objects, but it will no longer be\nused. All relations\
    \ to other objects will be listed in the `links` attribute.\n\n## JSON envelope\
    \ for collections\n\nFor collections, the JSON envelope looks slightly different.\n\
    \n    {\n        \"domainType\": <domain type>,\n        \"instanceId\": <string\
    \ to uniquely identify domain object>,\n        \"title\": <human readable header>,\n\
    \        \"links\": [<relation link>, ...],\n        \"extensions\": {\n     \
    \       <attribute name>: <attribute value>,\n            ...\n        },\n  \
    \      \"value\": [<domain object 1>, <domain object 2>, ...],\n    }\n\n## Link\
    \ relations\n\nEvery response comes with a collection of `links` to inform the\
    \ API client on possible\nfollow-up actions. For example, a folder response can\
    \ have links to resources for updating,\ndeleting and moving the folder. The client\
    \ does not have to know about the URL structure, it\njust needs to follow the\
    \ link. In this sense, the API is quasi self-documenting.\nThis provision of additional\
    \ information as a REST-API principle is also called\n[HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS).\
    \ In this context,\na `rel` specifies the type of relationship of the concerning\
    \ resource to the resource that generated\nthis representation. The rel attribute\
    \ is only of informational nature for the client.\n\nObjects may have these possible\
    \ generic link relations:\n\n * self - The API location of the current object\n\
    \ * help - Documentation for the currently requested endpoint\n * collection -\
    \ The API location for a list of object of the current objects' type\n * edit\
    \ - The API location to update the current object\n * edit-form - The GUI location\
    \ to edit the current object\n * delete - The API location to delete the current\
    \ object\n\nMembers of collections have also:\n\n * item - The API location of\
    \ a member of the current collection\n\nPlease note that these (except for self)\
    \ are completely optional and may or may not be available on\ncertain endpoints.\
    \ More specialized link relations are also available:\n\n * invoke - The API location\
    \ to invoke an action\n * start - The API location to start a long running process,\
    \ which the current object represents\n * cancel - The API location to abort the\
    \ long running process, which the current object represents\n * download - The\
    \ URL to download the object described by the current endpoint\n * move - The\
    \ API location to move the current object to another destination\n\nEndpoint specific\
    \ link relations are also possible.\n\n# Updating values\n\nWhen an object is\
    \ updated by multiple requests at the same time, it can happen that the second\n\
    request will overwrite important values from the first request. This is known\
    \ as the \"lost update\nproblem\" and can be prevented by a locking scheme. The\
    \ scheme that Checkmk uses for this is called\nan \"optimistic lock\" and allows\
    \ read access even when writes are happening. It works as follows:\n\n1. The user\
    \ fetches the object to be modified.\n2. The server responds with the data and\
    \ an HTTP `ETag` header containing a value which is something\n   like the \"\
    checksum\" of the object.\n3. In order to modify the object, the user sends an\
    \ update request with an HTTP `If-Match` header\n   which contains the value of\
    \ the previously fetched `ETag`. This ensures that the writer has seen\n   the\
    \ object to be modified. If any modifications by someone else were to happen between\
    \ the\n   request (1) and the update (3) these values would not match and the\
    \ update would fail.\n4. If you are sure you are not updating objects simultaneously\
    \ and want to avoid first fetching the\n   object in order to obtain its ETag\
    \ value, you can bypass this step by providing a \"*\" for the\n   the 'If-Match'\
    \ header like so.  `\"If-Match\": \"*\"`\n\nThis scheme is used for most `PUT`\
    \ requests throughout the REST API and always works the same way.\nDetailed documentation\
    \ of the various involved fields as well as the possible error messages can\n\
    be found on the documentation of each affected endpoint.\n\n# Querying Status\
    \ Data\n\nThe endpoints in the category \"Monitoring\" support arbitrary Livestatus\
    \ expressions (including And,\nOr combinators) and all columns of some specific\
    \ tables can be queried.\n\n### Note\n\nYou can find an introduction to basic\
    \ monitoring principles including host and service status in the\n[Checkmk guide](https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/monitoring_basics.html).\n\
    \n## Filter expressions\n\nA *filter expression* is a recursively defined structure\
    \ containing *binary expression nodes*,\n*negation nodes* or *combination nodes*.\
    \ With *filter expressions*, very complex Livestatus queries\ncan be constructed.\n\
    \n## Binary expression node\n\nA *binary expression node* represents one condition\
    \ on which to filter. `left` is always a\nLivestatus column name, `right` is always\
    \ a value.\n\n### Definition\n\n    {'op': <livestatus operator>, 'left': <livestatus\
    \ column>, 'right': <value>}\n\n### Operators\n\nA list of all list of all possible\n\
    [Livestatus filter operators](https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/livestatus_references.html#heading_filter),\n\
    can be found in the Checkmk documentation.\n\n### Example\n\nThis example filters\
    \ for an entry where the host_name equals to \"example.com\".\n\n    {'op': '=',\
    \ 'left': 'host_name', 'right': 'example.com'}\n\n### Note\n\nFor the specific\
    \ table used, please consult the endpoint documentation.\n\n## Negation node\n\
    \nThere is only one negation node, the `not` expression, which logically negates\
    \ a *filter\nexpression*. `expr` is a valid *filter expression*, so any *binary\
    \ expression node*, *negation\nnode* or *combination node* may be used here.\n\
    \n### Definition\n\n     {'op': 'not', 'expr': <any filter expr>}\n\n### Example\n\
    \nThis example filters for hosts which **do not** have the host_name \"example.com\"\
    .\n\n    {'op': 'not', 'expr': {'op': '=', 'left': 'host_name', 'right': 'example.com'}}\n\
    \nThis is equivalent to\n\n    {'op': '!=', 'left': 'host_name', 'right': 'example.com'}\n\
    \n## Combination nodes\n\n`and` and `or` combinators are supported. They can be\
    \ nested arbitrarily. `expr` is a list of\nvalid *filter expressions*, so any\
    \ number of *binary nodes*, *negation nodes* or *combination nodes*\nmay be used\
    \ there. These expression do not have to all be of the same type, so a mix of\
    \ *binary\nexpression nodes*, *negation nodes* and *combination nodes* is also\
    \ possible.\n\n### Definition\n\nThis results in a *filter expression* in which\
    \ all the contained expression must be true:\n\n    {'op': 'and', 'expr': [<any\
    \ filter expr>, ...]}\n\nThis results in a *filter expression* in which only one\
    \ of the contained expression needs to\nbe true:\n\n    {'op': 'or', 'expr': [<any\
    \ filter expr>, ...]}\n\n### Example\n\nThis example filters for the host \"example.com\"\
    \ only when the `state` column is set to `0`, which\nmeans the state is OK.\n\n\
    \    {'op': 'and', 'expr': [{'op': '=', 'left': 'host_name', 'right': 'example.com'},\n\
    \                            {'op': '=', 'left': 'state', 'right': 0}]}\n\n# Table\
    \ definitions\n\nThe following Livestatus tables can be queried through the REST-API.\
    \ Which table is being used\nin a particular endpoint can be seen in the endpoint\
    \ documentation.\n\n## Downtimes Table\n\n### Columns:\n\n| Column name | Type\

    # Authentication\n\nTo use this API from an automated client, a user needs to\
    \ be set up in Checkmk. Any kind of user,\nbe it *automation* or *GUI* users,\
    \ can be used to access the REST API. On a newly created site\nsome users are\
    \ already created. You can configure them in Checkmk at *Setup* > *Users*.\n\n\
    For the various authentication methods that can be used please consult the following\
    \ descriptions,\nwhich occur in the order of precedence. This means that on a\
    \ request which receives multiple\nauthentication methods, the one with the highest\
    \ priority \"wins\" and is used. This is especially\nconvenient when developing\
    \ automation scripts, as these can directly be used with either the\ncurrently\
    \ logged in GUI user, or the \"Bearer\" authentication method which takes precedence\
    \ over the\nGUI authentication method. The result is that the user doesn't have\
    \ to log out to check that the\nscripts works with the other method.\n\n<SecurityDefinitions\
    \ />\n\n\n\n# Queries through the REST API\n\nGiven that Livestatus handles commands\
    \ asynchronously, the Rest API  is only responsible for the\npreparation and dispatch\
    \ of these commands, without confirming their execution. To ensure the\ncommands\
    \ sent to Livestatus are executed as intended, users must verify this on their\
    \ own.\n\nThe following script is an example of how to create a host downtime\
    \ and check that it has indeed been created:\n\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env python3\n\
    \    import requests\n    import pprint\n    import time\n    from datetime import\
    \ datetime, timedelta\n\n    # Checkmk server details\n    SERVER = \"localhost\"\

    \n\n    session = requests.Session()\n    session.headers[\"Authorization\"] =\
    \ f\"Bearer {USERNAME} {PASSWORD}\"\n    session.headers[\"Accept\"] = \"application/json\"\
    \n\n    # Target host and downtime details\n    target_host = \"host01\"\n   \
    \ downtime_start = (datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=1)).replace(microsecond=0).isoformat()\
    \ + \"Z\"\n    downtime_end = (datetime.now() + timedelta(hours=2)).replace(microsecond=0).isoformat()\
    \ + \"Z\"\n    comment = \"Security updates #1234\"\n\n    # Send create downtime\

    \      },\n        json={\n            \"start_time\": downtime_start,\n     \

    downtime_type\": \"host\",\n                \"site_id\": SITE_NAME,\n        \
    \        \"query\": '{\"op\": \"and\", \"expr\": [{\"op\": \"=\", \"left\": \"\
    comment\", \"right\": \"'\n                + comment\n                + '\"},\
    \ {\"op\": \"=\", \"left\": \"type\", \"right\": \"2\"}]}',\n            },\n\
    \        )\n        if (result.status_code == 200) and (len(result.json()[\"value\"\
    ]) > 0):\n            found = True\n            break\n\n        time.sleep(5)\n\

    \        raise RuntimeError(\"Downtime not found.\")\n\n    print(\"Downtime successfully\
    \ created.\")\n\n\n# Compatibility\n\n## HTTP client compatibility\n\nIf you have\
    \ a client which cannot do the HTTP PUT or DELETE methods, you can use the\n`X-HTTP-Method-Override`\
    \ HTTP header to force the server into believing the client actually sent\nsuch\
    \ a method. In these cases the HTTP method to use has to be POST. You cannot override\
    \ from GET.\n\n## Compatibility policy\n\nIt is our policy to keep all documented\
    \ parts backwards compatible, as long as there is no\ncompelling reason (like\
    \ security, etc.) to break compatibility.\n\nIn the event of a break in backwards\
    \ compatibility, these changes are documented and, if possible,\nannounced by\
    \ deprecating the field or endpoint in question beforehand. Please understand\
    \ that this\ncan't be promised for all cases (security, etc.) though.\n\n## Versioning\n\
    \n### Definition\n\nThe REST API is versioned by a *major* and *minor* version\
    \ number.\n\nThe *major* number is incremented when backwards incompatible changes\
    \ to the API have been made.\nThis will reset the *minor* number to *0*. A *werk*\
    \ which contains the details of the change and\nmarking the change as incompatible\
    \ will be released when this happens.\n\nTh *minor* number will be increased when\
    \ backwards compatible changes are added to the API. A\n*werk* detailing the additions\
    \ will be released when this happens.\n\n**Note:** Despite the noted backward\
    \ compatibility, API consumers are best to ensure that their\nimplementation does\
    \ not disrupt use-case requirements.\n\n### Usage\n\nThe *major* version is part\
    \ of the URL of each endpoint, while the whole version (in the form\n*major*.*minor*)\
    \ can be sent via the HTTP header `X-API-Version`. If the header is not sent,\n\
    the most recent *minor* version of the through the URL selected *major* version\
    \ is used.\nThe header will also be present in the accompanying HTTP response.\n\
    \n### Format\n\n * URL: *v1*, *v2*, etc.\n * X-API-Version HTTP header: *major.minor*\n\
    \n### Notes\n\n * In the first release, the version part in the URL has been documented\
    \ as `1.0`. These\n   URLs will continue to work in the future, although using\
    \ the `X-API-Version` header will not be\n   possible with this version identifier.\
    \ You have to use the above documented format (v1, v2, ...)\n   in the URL to\
    \ be able to use the `X-API-Version` header.\n\n## Undocumented behaviour\n\n\
    We cannot guarantee bug-for-bug backwards compatibility. If a behaviour of an\
    \ endpoint is not\ndocumented we may change it without incrementing the API version."

                The field path may be followed by a list of subfields enclosed in
                parentheses (`(` and `)`).


                The outermost fields must be enclosed in parentheses and may be prefixed
                with an exclamation mark (`!`) to negate the selection.


                Examples:

                - `(ipaddress)` selects the field `ipaddress`, all other fields will
                be omitted.

                - `!(ipaddress)` excludes the field `ipaddress`, all other fields
                will be included.

                - `(ipaddress,ipv6address)` selects only the fields `ipaddress` and
                `ipv6address`.

                - `(attributes~ipaddress)` selects the field `ipaddress` within `attributes`,
                all other fields (not just within attributes) will be omitted.

                - `(attributes(ipaddress,ipv6address))` selects the fields `ipaddress`
                and `ipv6address` within `attributes`, again all other fields will
                be omitted.

                - `!(extensions~attributes(ipaddress,ipv6address))` excludes the fields
                `ipaddress` and `ipv6address` within `attributes` under `extensions`,
                all other fields will be included.
