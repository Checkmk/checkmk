        which API endpoints are deprecated and removed, and provide a brief explanation
        or reference on how users can update their API calls. For example: \"The following
        API endpoints have been removed: [list or example]. Please update your integrations
        to use the new endpoints as documented in [link or location]. Failure to do
        so will cause your API calls to fail with 404 errors after upgrading.\"","paragraph_division_suggestions_to_improve_text":"Break

        were removed; second, explain that this requires user migration and updating

        to perform the migration, for example: \"Refer to the migration guide at [link]

        with ''API endpoints removed deprecated versions.'' Combine migration requirement
        and update instruction into one sentence. Use active voice and remove filler
        phrases. For example: ''Removed deprecated API endpoints. Users must migrate
        and update API calls to new endpoints; old endpoints return 404 errors after
        upgrade.''"}}}'
