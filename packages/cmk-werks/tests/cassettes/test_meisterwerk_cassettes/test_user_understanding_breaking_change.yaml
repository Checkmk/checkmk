        recent update involves modifying the database schema to enhance performance,
        but this change is not automatic and requires a manual migration step. Before
        applying the upgrade, it is essential to back up the current database to prevent
        data loss. The migration process itself could be time-consuming, potentially
        taking several hours if the database is large. For our monitoring setup, this
        means we need to plan a maintenance window that accommodates this extended
        downtime to avoid false alerts or data inconsistencies during the migration.
        We should also communicate this planned downtime to all relevant stakeholders
        and prepare rollback procedures in case the migration encounters issues. Additionally,
        after the migration, we must validate that all monitoring functions and reports
        are operating correctly with the new schema. The werk is clear overall, but
        it does not specify the exact migration script location or detailed steps,
        so we will need to consult the official documentation or vendor support to
        ensure the migration is executed properly."}'
