        recent update introduces an improved dashboard that allows users to create
        personalized charts and export data in various file formats, making it easier
        to analyze monitoring data visually and share insights. This enhancement means
        our team can offer more flexible and detailed reporting options to stakeholders,
        potentially reducing the need for external data processing tools. We should
        review our current dashboard configurations to incorporate these new visualization
        features, update any user guides or training materials to reflect the changes,
        and communicate the new capabilities to all relevant users. Additionally,
        it would be prudent to schedule validation tests to ensure that custom charts
        and data exports function correctly within our environment. No unclear or
