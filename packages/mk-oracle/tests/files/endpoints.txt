# contains endpoints for testing
# Specify either
# 1. Connection string directly
# 2. Environment variable environment variable containing connection string, including "$" prefix
# 3. Environment variable like in 2., but with "CREDENTIALS_ONLY:" prefix. This will use the credentials
#    part of the connection string for following endpoints, but not consider the connection for testing.
#
# Connection string format:
# <hostname>:<user>:<password>:<port>:<instance>:<role>:<service_name>:<reserved>:<reserved>
#
# You can also omit username and password. In this case, the username/password from the previous
# connection will be reused.
# <hostname>:::<port>:<instance>:<role>:<instance_name>:<reserved>:<service_name>:_:_:
#           ^^^ will be replaced with the user and password
#
# CI_ORA1_DB_TEST is used optionally.
# It should follow to the rules above. It is assuned as a local connection endpoint.
# Typically contains localhost:SYS:<password>:1521:XE::XE:_:_
#
# Notes:
# * Currently, CI_ORA2_DB_TEST must be constructed, since CI delivers only password.
# * In case of specifying a string directly, DO NOT submit to git with credentials.
# * service_name is mandatory for connection
# * instance_name is required to check whether test correctly identifies the database
# * service_name and instance_name can be the same
# * you may set CI_ORA2_DB_TEST manually too#
#
$CI_ORA2_DB_TEST # typically "oracle-win.dev.checkmk.net:<user>:<password>:1521:FREE::FREE.oratest:_:_"
