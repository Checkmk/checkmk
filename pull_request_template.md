Thank you for your interest in contributing to Checkmk! Unfortunately, due to our current work load,
we can at the moment only consider pure bugfixes, as stated in our
[Readme](https://github.com/tribe29/checkmk#want-to-contribute). Thus, any new pull request which
is not a pure bugfix will be closed. Instead of creating a PR, please consider sharing new check
plugins, agent plugins, special agents or notification plugins via the
[Checkmk Exchange](https://exchange.checkmk.com/).
