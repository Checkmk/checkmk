# There is some confusion regarding where and how pylint should be run from an
# editor plugin, see e.g. https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/1758.
# Furthermore, recent pylint versions seem to be buggy regarding relative
# imports, see e.g. https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/3624. Our workaround
# for all this craziness: Just run pylint from the toplevel of our project.
