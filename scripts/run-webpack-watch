# A simple watch mode for js/css files.
# To play together with a site its etc/apache/conf.d/check_mk.conf has
# to be adapted. Either use the -w option of omd-vonheute or replace the
# paths to /omd/sites/* in the lines :
#
# Alias /heute/check_mk /omd/sites/heute/share/check_mk/web/htdocs
# <Directory /omd/sites/heute/share/check_mk/web/htdocs>
#
# with the path to web/htdocs of your git (e.g. /home/aa/git/check_mk/web/htdocs).
# After that 'npm run dev' you can run webpack in watch mode.
