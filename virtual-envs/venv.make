# The recent pipenv version 2018.10.13 has a bug that places wrong markers in the
# Pipfile.lock. This leads to an error when installing packages with this
# markers and prints an error message. Example:
# Ignoring pyopenssl: markers 'extra == "security"' don't match your environment
# TODO: pipenv and make don't really cooperate nicely: Locking alone already
# creates a virtual environment with setuptools/pip/wheel. This could lead to a
# wrong up-to-date status of it later, so let's remove it here. What we really
# want is a check if the contents of .venv match the contents of Pipfile.lock.
# We should do this via some move-if-change Kung Fu, but for now rm suffices.

# Cleanup partially created pipenv. This makes us able to automatically repair
# broken virtual environments which may have been caused by network issues.
